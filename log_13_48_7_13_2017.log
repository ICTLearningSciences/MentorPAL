Answer,Question
"Currently, I have two different career paths that I'm going on. One is my Navy Reserve career and the other one is my computer science career. In the Navy Reserve, I'm an Electrician's Mate Chief. I've been in for 17 years, 16 going on 17 years and I became a Chief, which is pretty high level, it an E7, out of E9 total. Those are the career steps, so, E1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and I am an E7. It took ten years to get there and I've been a Chief for the last six years. So, to become a Chief, it requires a lot of hard work and dedication and being an expert at your job, that's, you know, the title of what we're supposed to be. We're supposed to be able to show our junior sailors how to do things because we've done it so much ourselves. So, to get to that point, it took a lot of watch standing, it took a lot of drills, it took a lot of marching around, it took a lot of reading books, it took a lot of opening up, you know, presentations and information sheets about my job, during times that I didn't have to. I think that's the difference between a lot of Chiefs who make it and some people who don't, what you do on your free time. If you really care about your career, then, during your free time, you're not just going to watch DVDs and watch movies and play cards and just go on drums. You're actually going to spend some time trying to be advanced to the next grade, to the next promotion level. As far as my civilian career, that's me being a master's student at the University of Southern California, it took a whole lot even more, even more than the military, it took a lot more dedication, homework, assignments, test preparation. On my free time, I would spend so much time just staying up all night, just doing these homework assignments. Even after the test was over, I'd still open the book and, kind of like, get those questions that I didn't understand on the test, I would get those questions again to review, to try to understand what it is, what the class was trying to explain. So, this is math questions, science questions, even English questions. I would present an English assignment and then I get it back and, you know, These are all the mistakes that you made. So, I'd open up my Central Texas College, you know, handbook and I'd say, Oh, there should have be a quotation there, there should have been a semicolon there , so, even simple things like that. And all of this is in order to become an expert at whatever it is I'm learning. So, as long as you make sure that you have that final goal in mind, which is to be an expert at whatever it is that you're doing, then you'll become a high level, you'll wind up at USC at a master's course or you'll be a Chief or higher in the military.",What is your job?

"I like a lot of the pop movies like Titanic, Braveheart, Forrest Gump like a lot of the blockbusters but I have to say that my favorite movie of all time is actually not even a movie, it's an anime from Japan. I'm in Japan so I you see lots of anime and many of them are good but one blows everything out the water. Berserk is a movie about the medieval times, and there's this character Guts who is really strong and you know he wants to fight his own personal battles by himself but not really think about anything, no purpose but he meets this person Griffin who's very charismatic and he has this huge goal to like own his own kingdom and Guts sees this so he follows him and you know there's lots of romance, lots of blood and guts, lots of intellectual conversation, and believe it or not I actually thought a lot about my own life very much throughout this movie, so hats off to those guys who made that really bright anime.",What is your favorite movie?
"There's the Master Chief of the Navy, there's the Secretary of Defense, obviously the President and Vice-President, that's the hierarchy. Obviously if you're in active duty, then you have your Commanding Officer, you have your XO and those are, that's the President and Vice-President of your little command. But specifically, within your work center, the Chief is the guy. Chief, Senior Chief, Master Chief, those are the people that are in charge of all the enlisted people and they're your whole world. That's your mom and your dad.",Who is your most important person?
"So, some of the lifestyle changes that you can expect: number one, get used to wearing uniform. You're going to be putting this thing on every single day. We have a couple of different styles to choose from. We can put on coveralls if we're on the ship. These are the cammies that we wear when you're walking around a normal city but we also have like, a dress whites and dress blues. They look really nice. Another lifestyle change you can expect is to be following orders. So, if you're working at McDonald's and you have a boss telling you, you know, Go to drive thru , Go to make some breakfast in the morning , so same thing, that's not going to change just because you're the military. In fact, it's going to get a little bit more intense you could say. So, you're going to have, you know, five or six bosses. They have a hierarchy and you're going to hear from one less than the other but you're going to be hearing, you know, what to do every single day.",Is navy life difficult
