"So, I'm particularly fond of the military. I joined when I was 21 and I didn't really have that many skills available to me. I graduated high school and I wasn't the best high school grad, you know, many people in the military aren't and I tried college for a while and I was very, an on and off again student. I got a few Fs when I was there and because I was working two jobs at the time and you know, my days were pretty full. So, the military actually allowed me to have a semi-regular life, you know, like a semi-regular life. Because I was taking care myself, because I didn't have the support of my family, the military welcomed me with a job, a place to stay, some cash in my pocket, a skill set and that pretty much, once I got that grounding, then I was able to be very independent, very self sustaining for a long time. So, it's kind of, it took care of me in that way. So, do I love the military? You could say that I do. You know, it's the thing that allowed me to have a college education later on, it's the thing that allowed me to save up so much money and I think I'm doing pretty well for someone my age, so. As far as my job, my job as an Electrician's Mate, I didn't, it's not the job that I really wanted to do at the beginning. I wanted to learn languages and you know, travel the world a lot and I'm a nuclear technician. We weren't really allowed to do that because you're a nuke, you have to stay on the continental United States, So, I couldn't visit, I couldn't be stationed in Germany, I couldn't be stationed in France, which, you know, really, was irritating for me. And, I wasn't a very good engineer. I didn't have the engineering mindset when I joined the military at first. However, I grew to love my job because the training that they give you, they make you a real expert at it. So, once you find a job that you can do, you start doing well and then you start getting awards, you start learning more things on your own and eventually I said, You know what? Electrician's Mate is really cool. It's one of the best jobs that you can have in the military. So, I think it's, my love for the Navy comes from all of that combined.",Why do you do what you do?
"Things that keep me up at night are probably the same things that keep most Americans up and that's, you know, of course I fear for my life. No one wants to die. I think that even the most hardcore, you know, Marines, they don't want to go to war. Of course, they'd like our politicians to, you know, do things diplomatically. Everybody has family back home, everybody wants to, you know, see the next day. So, I'm not a coward, you know, when it becomes time to go fight, then I will but it's not like I want to fight. What I want to do is, I want everybody in the world to live together in peace and harmony but I know that that doesn't happen. So, what keeps me up at night, is thinking that any day now, any second, there could be a terrorist attack, you know, near my home. The people that I care about can be wounded, injured or the fact that I might have to go over there and you know, maybe put someone else in harm, you know, someone that I'm attacking or support someone who, you know,. attacks somebody. I don't want to see people dead or killed just like most people in the military I think but you know, even though it does keep me up at night, you know, I do have a good sleep and then the next morning, I wake up and I go to my job.",What makes you sleep at night?
