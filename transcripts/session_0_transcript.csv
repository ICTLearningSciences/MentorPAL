Introduction,hi my name is MC Clinton Anderson that's cheap like Christians make Clinton Anderson I'm originally from Los Angeles and I joined the military in the navy in two thousand it was a couple of years right after high school I grew up in for the most part in Los Angeles and I hope I graduate from high school I didn't really know exactly what to do right after high school so I spent about a year doing odd jobs and of the military seemed like it was a really good path for occasion and to develop his skills so after a year at Los Los one beat City College when I went decrees office he told me a different programs I could join christological technician our nuclear technology and I am pleased decided to be a neutral technologies are because it had really great advancement scheme and they gave out the most money for college so I did that I joined the navy and I went to South Carolina for my school I did that for two years arm actually your half a school and then I did a six months at all Albany the prototype after that to your stance arm going to the nuclear power program that I did my first aircraft carrier in San Diego on the USS John C. Stennis I did that for three years then I went up to Washington for another three more years and after that eight year tour and I decided to transfer from the navy arm active duty service to the reserve service and that's where I still am I did that for about eight years now since I got out of the active duty service I've been going to college first until you see Berkeley for a computer science in that I transfer to a university of southern California for my masters degree and that's where I'm at now 
Describe the process of joining the military.,so when I first want to join the military I went to go talk to recruiter and he give me a run down about what things you could actually do in the military as far as the job that you do on the places that you can go and I first of the test it's come to to tell you where you can sit in the military and that's what pretty high on it so they offered me some of some of the advanced jobs such as good logical technician and of the nuclear entrance field also on fracking troll main problem electrical technician so these are some of the things that I could do but I hadn't always been interested in them my whole life so I have to ask a couple people about the kind of job that he did what does he do what does an axeman do and eventually I chose nuclear technology you don't really find out what specific job you doing until you actually go to boot camp but on the nuclear field was probably the best choice for me on the recruiter didn't have that much information about it because I he was a certain job had about a hundred or so jobs that you can have I didn't really have that much information but he did give me a general overview about what it was like 
What are the major benefits of doing this kind of work?,the major benefits of doing this kind of work is for me I feel the fact that you're actually serving your country is pretty big a big reason for doing this I know it's kind of cliche but after I did my service and I came back of the fact that the whole entire world was at actually America was really supporting me where I went in school we always hear things about how much we supported veterans at school with my family bay it really gave me so much support that it feels like I'm I'm in this this smaller community within a larger community that really wants to help you succeed another thing that's pretty important is that they give me some skills that I can really take out to go into the real world now not every job that's in the navy can be presented to the world in its purest form so for instance if you're working with our nuclear weapons then you probably might not find a nuclear weapon job down there in the world real world but every every engineering job let's say has certain a certain skill set that you can use so I didn't really take my nuclear engineering job out there in the real world even though it was available but the fact that I learned so many indeed in skills really set me on the path to getting their current job that I have which is computer science Bob but I could have wanted to patrol in engineering that could what's a lecture continuing and I think I would have done just fine 
What are the major negatives of doing this kind of work?,so some of the major negatives of being an active duty military member arms held lie so many people think that the job itself when you're on the plane it's pretty hard on number one being apart from your family for so long also princes when I wanna deployment it was about six months for the first deployment seven months for the second appointment and we're fighting the Iraq war so he was about eight months almost for the third deployment and I know many people who had to leave their husbands have leave their wives up for extended periods of times have to leave their daughters out who were just born we're really worried about like what their families going while they were apart and they had limited contact with them when they were when they were when they were so far away so that's probably the most difficult part but then of course once you come back after deployment that it's a really you know happy times your your sickly backed it's glad to be back 
How did your expectations differ from your actual experience?,so when I first joined the military I actually knew about how it was deeds my father it has been in the army when I was in middle school so I grew up on a military base for two years and I guess living more after that so having great expectation about what could be expected I knew what a military base look like a new arm was my father's hours words and you that you have to a tea in the morning surgical train in the morning and I knew that to be gone for extended periods of time so those parts were pretty much expected for me as far as different from what I from what I was used to so I didn't think that there would be so much extra work that was involved I did it's so when I made my dad was in the military in Germany he had basics the basic schedule he woke up the morning anytime came back around five o'clock it was nice had Saturdays and Sundays off for the most part the navy is very different in the fact that conferences going on the planet you have your normal work schedule and then at the end of your works work day you also have to do preventive maintenance I used to be called at any time if there's a casualties Bob problem with one is equipment then you have to go down and work on it for several hours finale that we out there fighting they always want you to be prepared so you have these things called general quarters which you can do to three for almost every single day arm for a week so armed and that that's always around eight o'clock and it should end at ten o'clock eleven o'clock twelve o'clock so your days are keys repeated hectic every four days you probably up all night how did you know what your job is it not every job is like that obviously but I'm for some of the more critical jobs out you can be on demand free pretty hard so it actually does prepare you when you come back and start doing college then they see being in the military TTC did you discipline it out they know that you work really hard and that's just the facts of blood obviously if you're in those types of positions where you work a lot harder Jim maybe they have some compensation for you big militant more money so can take 
What were your position and duties in the Navy?,so I had a schedule that actually promoted me pretty consistently as I stayed in the military so when I first went to boot camp I I was in the nuclear technology technology fields so during the capture and he won which is the lowest rank of them listed side but as soon as I graduated I became in E. three and that's what I was for the first six months that I was in my case school after I graduated then I became a key for which is still a lower position but it's called the petty officer which the they allow you to mislead you things on your own arms for the most part like if they actually do pretty and maintenance if they ask you to fix something if they ask you to stand watch your love to do that without without limits is religion I guess that for about another year so I was in the marines in the first year my deployment when I became and he five to get that through the star program which is where you sign on for another two years so my regional conflict wrist was six years I sunstar programs which are means that I was suppose to be in the navy for a total of eight years and they give me a little bit of money about loss of forty thousand dollars I think and they automatically promoted media E. five and as the five then you're teaching the petty officers and it frees me to is below you so I'm the scum like a mini supervisor you say and I did that for a couple more years I think around two thousand and six that's when I became a first class that six years after being in the navy for the first time and that's when you're considered a supervisor so that's when you happened that's when you're the person that's actually telling off three or four people what to do and you go down there and you don't really operate the question read young used equipment yourself but you kind of looking over the shoulder of people whose are actually doing the work because you've done it so many times before because you've been doing for the last four years so you know you're there for basically quality control while the super wild about people under you are looking for supervision asking what do I do how do I unscrew this the final part is where I became a chief and chief of the ones who've been doing the first class job for a long time and there's the ones who definite don't touch the equipment arm in fact we have we have this rule that is both the walk around with a coffee cups not because you're thirsty all the time but that just tells you that you're different opposite touch any of equipment are yourself so mom can for the most part you're up in the office doing paperwork making sure that it all reads correctly and that there are no problems and out the other happy times you down in the plan on making sure the first classes are you know become chiefs themselves and you have an overall on the gold makes for the plants jobs you know fit their schedule for the time schedule mixture that things happen on time making sure that I'll get a job needs to be done that you're the one who sees that pay you know I'd like we need somebody on this there's a strip coming from here let's put a job in for that there's obvious machines right running kind of off let Saddam you know shut down for right now and make sure that it's that somebody can take a look at it so first class can really do that but chiefs who have been you know the plan very well can do that so I'm cheap right now after it after sixteen years of 
Describe the work you would do on a typical day.,so right now I'm in the navy reserves which is slightly different know what you can expect us from being an active duty so the reserves we our main job is that we go on on trains Daniel trainings so for instance we gotta New Hampshire to a shipyard and we work and in the same fashion as a civilian so then I really expected to do active duty work they be going at eight o'clock sleep leave home around five o'clock normal workday schedule and we're just supposed be one of them so if they're supposed to be you know removes that fans and painting them that's what we're doing this was to be no fixing lights and installing insulation that's what we're doing as well so our regards seen what rate your arm or how high your it's basically about the same page leisure the chief like me would you kinda like overlooked other active duty members but busily working as as a civilian now that's vastly different than what you expect as an active duty service member so we have to two types of jobs that we can have we can have our job we do when we're stateside so for instance if we're odd living in San Diego or living in Hawaii basically we have maybe shortened days aren't you going around eight o'clock or seven o'clock and going on if you just got off the plane and or or what your time frame is you could be leading right after lunch so you have out just for five hours the work preteens and you go home or if it's been awhile since you've been on the plane and then you probably need to full working for working days which is our for me I was working on an aircraft carrier so we parked car pitifully how far away from base who walk about known twenty minutes to work on from the base we go when since in a little area until we all rob looked up together probably we talk about what we're going to be doing for one hour to after we have like all the work packages complete for that day then we split off into groups you say you two are going over there you two are going up in the third act you two are going you know down to the class or the build is or where it is and it was a break from that point on you basically on your own you have your your schedule that's in front of you and you know that it takes about four hours to do seeking go when you can do a little bit you can go up and ask questions in go read a book about it which is what we doing you can kind of like break a little bit it's like Hey let's go get some coffee or something conflict they give you about like a two or three hour jobs in a four hour period so they expect you to be done by the end of the day and they're not gonna try to over Ricky so much so toward any day expect people to start slowly you know showing up again if people are still lagging behind and say Hey you go help them so badly by four o'clock been everybody should be you know set to go home very rarely do you have to stay over arm so that there's not that much alone extra work that needs to be done but even though those might be easier days left to have these things called workups where'd you know you do six months of deployment he come back getting easier schedule for about you know two or three months and then you start going out so see arms in the middle of the ocean caught this evil you'd be lamentable ocean for awhile for about a month but maybe two weeks or something just saw spinning around in that that's when your work shoots up a little bit because like what you need to go you're on the air in the middle of an aircraft airsoft arm you get there at eight you days until four and then they expect you to do one or two or three hours at the end just doing whatever the city dump her on the ship 
How strongly would you recommend this occupation to others?,so recommending that maybe to others requires a lot of a lot of thought I've met many people in the navy who wears pretty anxious to get out at the end I met many people probably more people that really want to make it up a lifelong career and for old ones know that either they did it they did Tom I was probably in the middle of that I I reach my eat your point and I had a big decision to make after twenty years you're allowed to retire which is our it is really good opportunities for those who aren't have a family have a good have a good reason for wanting the consistent paycheck and if they're happy with this album making then then they would stay but I actually wanted to do other things of my life been then support in the country work on aircraft carriers and submarines and stuff so I felt like for instance are doing computer science we work with our virtual reality and things like that so if I stayed in the military then I would I would I really would be able to pursue that that line of work there are jobs like that but they're they're really hard to come by especially offerings as I was in nuclear technology so trying to do something like that would not have been in the question on so it depends on really what you want to do if you have the goal of doing civilian type work if you want to work for Google or Facebook if you wanna arms be I have checked and all star football player something Dan obviously the military is not the way to go but if you're kind of unsure what you want to do with your life and you join the military and you take this skill on that I can say if if you don't find the other parts of the military too distracting then it's an excellent excellent our retirement packages excellent Creech voice and toughest leads you know certain countries one of the places that you can do in your life so it's it's at the I think it's an honorable profession how 
Where did you go after you left active duty?,after I left my eight years of active service I was pretty sure that I want to go to college armed I didn't apply to colleges a lot why was James I had a few credits to my name so the first thing I did was I went back to my hometown wells hello Los Angeles I found a little city that had a really good communicators programmers Pasadena so at Pasadena City College and arm I was still in the engineering field so I didn't exactly know what I wanted to study but I knew what I had done in the military which was on do electrical electrical technician work and about nuclear power workings nobody chemistry little bit of thermodynamics and things so I I thought some of that was interesting I didn't really know my sure path until about two years after CUNY because that's when I decided to computer science and what's a university to going to my chosen field bond in academic profession but to tell you that I did not is is like joining the minute the military all over again 
Describe your current life/career goals.,what I wanted to after I get my masters program I am still considering getting off a PhD in education or for instance learning sciences so I can help people understand things better by using the computers by using our technology so something I'm really proud of and released on you know grateful for is that while you're in the military they make things very very easy for you also friends and think you take somebody from somebody fresh from college or from high school and I put into a program maybe six months maybe couple weeks and by the end of it they really know what they're supposed to be doing so you can come in and say Hey I I'll arms I have never seen a ship before and by the end of the program through to cap into a school and see school probably venue St Vincents say yes I'm I really know what I'm doing I can go on an aircraft carrier I can sit in the seat and what these buttons do I know of what happened what I need to do in case of a casualty I can answer my officers pretty you know competently so I think I'm trying to say is that their training program is exceptional it's the best I've ever had even better than college so I think I want to take this training that I've had from the navy and present it to civilians and the best way possible I think I can do that through computers are because you can actually track yourselves like for instance if you try to teach math oz rather than writings on a blackboard you can actually have people learn by computers I am the contract to see where they are what things they need to learn and how you can get them to where they need to be the fastest and I also want to take that training and give it back to the needs to make the navy's training better as well Sony do it both ways 
How did the Navy help you after serving?,so that may be really helped me in so many different ways I I can't even begin to imagine when I stopped going to high school I had absolutely nothing in my pocket I didn't have any skills that I could actually take for any by any viable job but after I joined us service and eight years later and I had all the engineering skills that I needed and I also had of the Montgomery GI bill which take care of me for the next five years or so they say it's thirty six months and then the case you for every much in school but I don differences if you wanna cleaning college you don't actually need all that money is make it stretch out a long a long time so here it is eight years after I finished the military and yeah I'm I'm in debt a lot not through my through a master's program but for my undergrad five years worth arm it really it really made sure that I didn't want for anything I had my apartment cited feed myself I could have cars did really have any problems pain for anything I needed and plus the because you were in the service all the schools that you go to have a speech should have a pretty big veterans program that can help you with the things like for instance registering for classes if are you going to issues without the prior service that you had you need some kind help so I can overcome those issues if you need lawyer work also for me and I was a part of the veterans association sends I could go to a lot of the hospitals nearby for a very very cheap or almost free so all these things combined it seemed that just because you get out of the service as an actor the person doesn't mean that your military career and I still feel like I'm a vital parts of the military even though it's been eight years since I've been active duty 
 What organizations were the most helpful to you in your career?,so the navy has meaning organizations that help people while the rings stars health services spars lawyer services but the one I found was the most hopeful was something called MWR essence for morale recreation and welfare that's basically the navy's are so recreation services for people that have off time and when I do something fun so for instance when you're in San Diego they give you all the things that are associated around the area that are pretty cheap and that are you might think are enjoyable for you and your family so for instance they tell you about sea world magic mountain because you can go fishing and boating and hunting climb downs as we have our regular towards all the time when you're out to see hope when you're on your deployment and they can actually send somebody ahead of you so we're responsible for it's in Singapore and what you plan then that person is there waiting for you and then they have all the things that you do in Singapore so it's I it helps you so that you have to look for that these things yourself and you can really a really efficient with your time so in the BRS absolutely outstanding 
What skills are necessary to succeed in your field?,so some of the crucial things that you need to succeed in my field on number one would be probably be disciplined when someone gives you tasks that useful see do you also go down without question so much about what it is that you're doing of France's they might ask you to do something pretty difficult go up top and you know do some campaigning for going to the scene where it's really hot where you can be really sweaty and removal module and put it back so is also be able to do what they're telling you to do an office person do the steps in order in order that they tell you to do it so if you skip a step that could be a big problem another thing is our hard work so in many cases useful still work for a lot longer than that required set of lower forty hours per week or something so sometimes to be working for twelve hours and I have had many many days that you're working for twenty four hours sometimes even thirty six hours so you're you're over there and you need your coffee but sometimes you need to have some people that can actually do that type of hard work and see if you can't do that type of work then the military might not be the best option for you but what you do do it then you you have this resolved that you can pretty much take up any task that's given to you like later on in life so mountain if you have hardworking disciplined and we pretty much set to be a military member 
What are the biggest challenges you've faced and how did you overcome them?,so some of the challenges that are faced was I really missed the civilian life style once I was doing my deployments and sometimes it claims to be pretty difficult you kids be there for about a week or maybe two weeks and you want to just like go watch a movie you wanted to go see your friends or play pool or at least for me Yom visit it's going dates or at least try running your car and you don't have access to any of those things after work after full work hours then you have sometime at the end of the day but pretty much you can play cards with your friends you can go down and play guitar or be in a rock band but basically your whole entire world are your brothers and sisters there on the ship with you and you have a but but gradually smaller and smaller place that you can actually experience things so for instance when you wanted to do civilian things and you captain that can kind of keep up on you and make you feel depressed but when things like that happen you can actually go to the chaplain you can go talk to your friends and you just realize that you know what you're doing is for a better a better cause and after you know several months to get back in that makes you enjoy the things that you're doing back home a lot more 
What is one thing you would change about your career?,about my job I guess it would change a couple of things the first one would be I would like to have experienced a lot more things than I was associated with so my job was a nuclear technologies that means their three jobs that you can have within that field you can be in the mechanical filter or that you filled or electronics field and I was fortunate to be in the electrical field and I like that job I liked working with a full teaching current and making sure that the turbines ran our the way they're supposed to like there are a lot of other interesting job that I saw that I would like to say Hey you know what like I wish I would have done that for a couple weeks or a couple of years you know for instance are they have this cryptologic techno technician job creek crypto tech job that I seem so cool you know like I despise and they can learn different languages and that just wasn't interesting in that that wasn't an option for me after you decide your first job another thing that I really wish I would have I got involved in the navy is I would like to explore different country's so for instance when I was a kid I was apart of my dad's community when he was in Germany and that those are some of the best times of my life so when I joined the military I decided Hey you know what I want to live in Italy I wanna live in Germany I wanna live in France black I come to find out that my job specifically didn't allow for that because I was in the nuclear field we were only allowed to be domestic stateside so even though I want to travel and even of those jobs are available based on my job those were barred from me so early secular traveled on had had a different station especially overseas when I was in the military 
Who gave you the best advice about your career?,so I received lots of input from many people throughout my throughout my youth my family is really been in the military for you know much of its you know generational history so I had information from my uncles from my grandfather from various cousins who actually done the working came back from many different sources as well Branson's airforce marines Coast Guard my my father himself was in the army and he's probably the one that gave me the best input about what it is he was doing even though it's a different field therefore I'm sorry army verses on navy actually told me many things that actually spurred my interest spurred my pride and spirit spread my desire to come to see what the military was like so because he's an army he would work out a lot and I thought Hey you know it like I can get in really good shape because of it he had out a pretty consistent paycheck and I did have the richest family you know so living with him actually kind of style you know you can have a really nice card out of the driveway and you can have really nice clothes and you can take your kids on these vacations so I thought Hey you know what like the salary is satisfactory and the other and the third thing other than duh the salary and experience was there was a pretty big MW our community without in Germany at the time so I remember from my youth I waited a good school and then at the end I would go with all my friends we go roller skating then we go to play pool we go out bike riding in the in the backyard of there are so many things that we can do with MW are and I saw that you know it like I have experienced that at any other time in my life they they actually provide you sit with so much so dot dot the recreation is probably a pretty big thing that spurred me to want to join the military as well so I spent all that since I've been in 
"What is the best advice someone gave you, and what do you wish someone had told you?",so when I was younger I received lots of advice from many different people but probably the most critical piece of advice that was given to me is that out you have to really work hard for the things that you want in life something that I wish someone would have told me that I didn't get would be how how demanding some jobs out there can really be so I was under the impression that you know you start of normal job around in the morning sometime and then you finish that job round in the evening and that most jobs out there were like that but I come to find out that there's a whole gamut of jobs out there that are waiting for you and you have to be prepared for them you have to be willing to get past your preconceived notions about what a normal job can be and try to delve into the crew that you that you there that that's waiting for you so for instance if you in the marines and you think one would have a nine to five job did not then you're probably said sadly mistaken especially where different locked in a war I've I've been fortunate to never have to put my own self in the line of fire but I know that at least many military people are in that are in that boat and so they have to be able to really know what it is know the job that they took on be respectful of it and maybe do that job even though they weren't really traps for it it's a 
What is something that I haven't asked but should have asked?,something that I would suggest to somebody who's wanting a lot of military career and isn't really sure about what tasks would be that you can actually prepare for your job a lot before you actually joined the service so for instance I was going into the nuclear field and something that I did it that I thought helped me tremendously was actually taking too many college classes so I knew that the nuclear field had a chemistry and heat transfer in physics and I tell you the truth I was a terrible student when I was in high school so I knew I had to brush up on that stuff ands I am so glad I did because once I start going to a school and a power school if I hadn't taken those prior classes then I would've been completely lost so and it's good to Chyna see the job that you want to join and in the few months that you have before you actually start the job find some kind of program or some kind of extra training that you can do Sir did you suck more involved yourself more in the know about you're a school job 
What would you advise to someone in the process of choosing a career?,so something that I would advise anybody did you who's trying to join the navy arm or any part the military is try to get the best job that you can possibly get so you gonna take a test at of one of the assignment processing centers and based on that test you're gonna be able to choose from multitude of jobs so I noticed that some people who took some of the user types of jobs later on in their careers they kind of wish that they would have liked push themselves they said well you know I like I I don't know anything about engineering but I do know how food services work so that seems like a decent job for me but later on I I could you know how tough the thing people and he would say you know what like I really wish I would of tried a mechanical job or the weapons shop when elevated job so he can go both ways some sometimes you are you're an engineer and you say you don't like this is only for me I don't really like the well that I'm working with I don't like the heat that that it that's down in the plants on but I see everybody up on the on the third deck who were in nice air conditioned rooms who like work with paper and pencil all day and it seems like more of the type of job that I'm interested in you know also I figure out whether you're more mechanically inclined engineering inclined if you're more of a someone who likes to be behind a computer ands despite all the jobs that are available in front of you try to do something that's I do think you'd have the most enjoyment from 
How would you advise me to choose between a military and civilian career?,if you're considering the differences between a military career and a civilian career you be surprised to find out that many of them are extremely compatible so you can easily find any military career and can find its equivalent in the civilian world you can actually do it the opposite way blood on if you are thinking about a job that's compared to both of them you might number one seed at the military piece about the same or slightly less than I want them to civilian career but I think that the benefits of the military probably far outweigh civilian counterpart so for instance yes that pays like similar or slightly less however we have free healthcare with the military that's not considered insulin world yeah I love free arm access to a lot of red recreational things back which pretty much adds up as far as like saving money also the military has some of the best retirement packages around so after twenty years you can actually leave the military with half your base pay off for the rest of your life so many people can retire at forty years old and now you don't find the equivalent in the civilian world so yes I have to take them for their face value and say well civilian job I get be in one place or I can like cheese my jobs very very easily I I don't have to one deployments and my cell you can be a little bit higher but with the military you have a better retirement package you on house guaranteed job like it's it's very hard to be fired from the military lets you do something are pretty terrible so you have a job security you have many other things like veterans care and health care and recreation that's you just don't find out in the civilian world so consider both very very carefully and aside if this is simply gonna be your career I would say that the military is probably a better choice for you if the pace comparable 
What makes you proud?,I think I'm most proud Wayne I come back from a deployment and I see the fruits of my labor so I know that I was out there for six months you know it was sweating heat listen to people kind of command me around to do things to fix this machine so wake up on this time and you know step for long periods of time so sweeping clean I can pick up after my area pretty much daily for for the vast majority of my time in the military these things can really have an effects on the way that you see the military as but that's not your job if you look at the grand scheme of what it is you're doing you're out there making sure that this aircraft here is in its topsy and having planes fly so destroy these targets protect these lives so protect our national interests that's actually what you're doing so if you look at that grand scheme of what what it is you're doing you're not this spring down a wall or fixing this pump you actually making sure this ship is doing its job so once you come back from that and you see all the people that are waiting for you all the men and women who have been waiting for you to come back wondered what it is you're doing up there your love to come back and say you know what I've been protecting you I've been making this country safe and now let's go home and enjoy some of the things that I've been out there work really working for 
What keeps you up at night?,so something that keeps me up at night is when I think about how stronger military can be when you're out there on the plane and we have all these big bombs and smart pilots and very sophisticated intelligent people on I I I think that regardless of how strong our military seems it only takes a couple of people saw bypass all that and still cause less damage to Muslims that are on the Americans shorter so I think that we really need to really focus on how will the military can be exposed in so many different ways so that concludes our cyber so people can attack us through the internet that includes like a real people so people can attack us with grounds but also with spies you know people can come into the country at so many different ways and get into really really critical parts of our country and we would know about it so even though I'm an epicurean it seems really tough I think we have to realize that people with very limited technology can still cause lots of damage and especially given in the military no matter where I am on which every base I'm on even in the United States my life is always a danger and yours is too so that's something that it's me up at night 
What are some things you do really well?,so something that I really pride myself on is my bill it's instruct people about what it is they're supposed to be doing so this is something that took or long time are trying to develop as a bit in the military so now I can get orders from my officer and kind and display that so that the people who are working under me and I know that I can be clear I know that I think about things like the time schedule that I'm asking them to do it in the ability that the house I would if they need help whether I need to go check on them in about an hour to you know these are things that I didn't really know when I was just a first class or even and I defy a second class petty officer that now I'm very familiar with and it's it rolls off the tongue I can I I can supervise plumage anything anywhere 
"In active duty, how much did you travel?",when I was in active duty I didn't really travel as much as I could have many of my friends they so you get one month per per year that's when the military and they took it you know from the day that they're supposed to leave all weapons so the morning that you spoke to return because I didn't really have a damaged suitcase with my family or I would be really close them aso France that I can visit them anytime I wanted to then I didn't really take too much vacation and I saved up a lot of vacation myself so for instance I think when I left I had about three months of vacation you know that you know I just don that the money for blood and there were some times in my life where on it again maybe two years since I actually like took a long vacation you know so I would take back and fly cross country and visit my family when I was living on the other side of the Cup but for the most part they give you lots of paid vacation time so Francis from the Christmas time run the new years' time sometime in the middle of the year they give you like no forty weeks or by David they weeks that are you can take and that's been pretty pretty good from it 
What gets romanticized about your career field that shouldn't be?,so something that a lot of people think are associated with all the military people that just isn't so is our physical fitness so when they try to explain you know what your sailor you soldier you're gonna be working out all the time you gonna be you know super in shape you going to be you know out there with loud heavy loss on the beach you know one two three four that just isn't so so I noticed that with the military in the four different portions yeah airforce marines navy Coast Guard for instance I guess the marines probably can be like that Blair is for the navy armed it's really hard to work out of when you're in Francis on aircraft here on the planet there just isn't that space for you to be working out all all day every day and not only that from the morning all the way up until you know late at night you can be working all day there just isn't enough time to be in the gym you know arm pumping a sweat but not to say that that that isn't there anybody that wants to work out can be in shape and I think for the most part military members are in great physical shape but are there some of us who are will be check really been then we should be so 
How did you manage your career and family effectively?,the way that I managed Crean family effectively is I mean sure that my family knew exactly what it is that I was doing knew exactly what my schedule would be so for instance when we were responsive one appointment for a long prison time I would explain to them you know I thought this is how much contact I can have with you if a for some reason I say that I can call on Monday and it just turns out to be Thursday that I call is not because I don't want to you can contact with you it's because like phones aren't available for our work schedule is too is too hectic for me to call so as long as I do that type of preparation before any critical thing that I do they pretty much know that you don't use the military that's kind of expected and there's a big community of spouses and family members that they can rely on so for instance alright there's a husband it says you know what I have heard from my wife for our one week now what's going on and they can contact them their command specifically there's this also club that he can talk to and say Hey you know I like have you heard from them either they can get them in contact or they can just say Hey you know what this is our business schedule but you can talk to me and they can provide each other with that support 
Who do you see as the beneficiaries of the work that you do?,I think that people who get supported most by the work that you are basically everybody that lives in America and you anybody on our shores I know that's a very general statement but from what I understand it's our it's probably the most accurate so I were out there defending our country from terrorists and from the smallest grow that you see to the you know the president himself you know everyone gets see some kind of benefit from that specifically let's say we go into a country and I'm a direct support I mean the direct support of the aircraft shares that goal and help our soldiers Stalin new government in that area of of the world so I would also like to think that the people on who we are providing of the service for the private military service for you know fighting wars for they would see some kind of benefit to us being in their country and installing different aspects in place I wanna say that war is good yeah it's definitely not buddy it does provide a service sometimes words need to be fought and I would we're doing it for a reason and hopefully that reason is good it's not just to protect ourselves and our land we actually have the world's can say that America is America is acting as the military the world police and if you don't believe that then you not going to really believe the words that you fight arm inevitably that they're beneficial and I do believe it so I have faith in my president I have faith in the government leaders in the generals and the and the problem everybody that that's has a high position of power meat asked to do something that I think that I don't question them I have faith in them and the people that were affecting I hope we're effecting positive look 
What is your favorite memory from your experiences?,without a doubt the thing that I look back on consistently is thug the great times I had when I was doing my port visits so when unemployment on yeah which can be pretty tough but once you pull in to a new country France in Singapore Hong Kong Malaysia Australia Canada these are also the places I've been and I remember some of those port visits like it was yesterday I remember the place that we went bars that we drank at you know museums that we visited diabetes that we swam in so the the restaurants that we ate at these are things that you cannot find in America even though I I've been all around America so they gave me a great perspective on life and actually made me remember my time in the military as being fantastic some
