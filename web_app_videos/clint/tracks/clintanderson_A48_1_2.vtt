After you do your activity tour, then it really depends on what type of

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.800
 job you have, to dictate what you want to do afterwards. So, if you

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.270
 really love your job, then you'll probably make it a thirty year career

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.740
 if that's possible. I know a lot of people who were like spies,

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.220
 you know, the crypto techs, the people in human relations, the public

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.690
 relations officers, they absolutely love their job and they couldn't

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.170
 think of doing anything else. Some of the people with harder jobs,

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.640
 for instance, the nuclear field, maybe some of the advanced jobs

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.110
 like the E. T.'s or the fire control men, they might be expected to

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.590
 do a little bit more work and they can be a little bit more demanding,

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.060
 sometimes a little bit more frustrating. They have to do more sea

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.530
 tours, so you get to a point where you want to actually live the civilian

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.010
 life that you see many other people are experiencing. So, by

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.480
 the time your six years is up or four years, in some cases, is up,

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.960
 that's a pretty big milestone for you to make for your career and the

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.430
 turnover can be pretty sharp. My guess is that 20% of people actually

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.900
 stay in, while the other 80%, they actually go out and use their

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.380
 education benefits and live higher paying jobs, doing something that's

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.850
 a lot easier work.
