00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.430
I've had a lot of cool experiences in the Navy. One that stands out, that

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.010
 I'm immediately thinking about is, when I went to Japan for the

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.590
 first time. I went to Sasebo and it's not the, you know, the most exciting

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.170
 thing that I've ever done but it was the first time that I was

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.750
 in the country that I wanted to be in, during the time that I wanted

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.330
 to be at for an extended amount of time. So, I was in Sasebo, which

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.910
 is at the very very bottom of Japan, like little city that you've

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.500
 probably never heard of but it's close to a couple of major cities.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.080
 So, I think I went to Hiroshima which is the city that was bombed in

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.660
 the war, in World War 2 and that was an experience, just walking around,

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.240
 seeing the peace park and things like that. I went to Fukuoka,

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.820
 which is a really big city, similar to Tokyo, it's not as big as Tokyo

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.400
 but it has many of the same styles of buildings and highrises and

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.980
 when I was walking past one of the computers, this is what, in 2006,

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.560
 I noticed that it had a funny shape to it. I'm walking past and

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.140
 I'm like, you know, Japan is supposed to be one of the world's best

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.720
 electrical countries right, the ones with the highest grade electrical

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.300
 equipment. So, I'm walking past this computer and my eyes are kind

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.880
 of, like, kind of weird. It was 3D, which is kind of weird because

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.460
 I wasn't wearing glasses, this is just while I was walking so I looked

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.040
 closer and as I turned around the computer, the person was, like,

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.620
 looking at me and moving her face and stuff and that's the first time

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.200
 I had ever seen it. Even right now, this is several years later,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.790
 I still haven't seen something like that. So, that's when I, kind of,

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.370
 realized, "Hey, you know what? These engineers over here really know

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.950
 what they're doing and they're very advanced." And, I guess another

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.530
 place that I went to, was Australia. So, I got to pet the kangaroos

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.110
 and some koalas and got to eat at the Cadbury chocolate factory.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.690
 It was pretty cool. It was good times then. So, I think those two are

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.270
 the best ports that I've had and the coolest things that I've done

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.850
 in the Navy.
