00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.270
I have a college degree and that allows me to apply to be an officer but

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.680
 not everybody who has that degree wants to go that route. So, to

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:17.100
 be an officer, you have to want to manage people, do lots of paperwork

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.520
 sometimes, to be in charge of the success or the failure of an entire

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.930
 unit and that carries a lot of responsibility. I'm an enlisted

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.350
 person and I do supervise the people that are underneath me. However,

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.770
 an officer's main goal is to become more and more important down the

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.180
 line. So, for instance, if you're a captain or even a commander,

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.600
 you could have 300-400 people underneath you and that's the main goal

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.020
 of most officers. For an enlisted person, you're more technically

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.430
 based. So, even though you have a small unit, that drive to want to

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.850
 lead people is slightly different.
