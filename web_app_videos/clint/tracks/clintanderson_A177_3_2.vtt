00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.850
I chose to be a part of the navy yes because I wanted to further my career

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 and have you know a good salary, all the benefits, but I also feel

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.850
 that you have to serve your country at sometime in your life. Now

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 I know that sounds cliche, but that's the way that I feel. I came

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.850
 from a really military family. My uncle was in the military, my dad

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.850
 was in the military, my brother was in the military, and me too, and although

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 yes I could of just been a civilian, like I was on that path. It

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 felt like, at least for me in particular, it felt like something

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.850
 would've been missing from my life, something I can't be on my death

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.850
 bed and say that I never protected my country the way that I saw

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.850
 my family protect it. So it was a calling for me. Why would other

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 people join the military especially if you don't have military people

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.850
 in your family, you have to think. Well first you have to trust your

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.850
 politicians. You'd have to think that they're going to war and they're

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.850
 defending America for good reason. So the wars that we fight we

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.850
 hope will bring stability to the world. You might see on TV that you

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.850
 know children are bloodied and people are you know like running for

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.850
 their lives, running from terrorism, running from lots of different

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.850
 things, you know you've seen the news. So if you wanna be a part

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.850
 of bringing that to an end, then military is one way that you can at

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.850
 least try. Also defending the nation, now we've been safe for a long

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.850
 time. Yes we had 9-11 and yes there are domestic terrorists but compared to

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.850
 other countries in the world, you might realize that America

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.850
 is a pretty safe place to live. When you're considering foreign powers

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.850
 trying to come in and influence us. So we have that strong military

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.850
 to thank for that. So if you want to be a part of that team you

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.850
 know, and have the stamp of veteran for your character for as long

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.850
 as you live, then the Navy would be a good spot to start.
