00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.910
If I could meet anyone in the world then I think it would have to be Sam

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.970
 Harris. There's a lot of people I respect. There's Stephen Hawking

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:16.040
 who is a really great guy, I'm actually working on a project here

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.100
 at my computer science that can help him speak. There are smart guys

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.160
 like Neil Degrasse Tyson, he's a physicist who is really bright. He just

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.230
 narrated the most recent Cosmos about the planets in the world

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.290
 just like Carl Sagan did back in the day, so a really bright guy but

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.350
 those are the people that can teach me something, I don't think that

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.410
 I could provide anything to them. I don't think that our conversations

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.470
 would be on the same plane. But Sam Harris, he's a person who

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.540
 kinda like Richard Dawkins, he's an atheist and he has ideas about different

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.600
 religions and he's also a computer scientist who has ideas

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.660
 about artificial intelligence. He has lots of different ideas to talk

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.730
 about I think that can make for excellent conversation. I disagree

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.790
 with him about a lot of things and I think that he could actually change

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.850
 my mind about a lot of things which is why I wanna meet him.
