00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.890
Probably, the biggest failure that I've ever had in my life would be the

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.920
 time that I applied for the Naval Academy, that's the United States'

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.960
 main way to produce their admiral oriented officers. So, I applied

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.000
 there as a 22-year old and I got rejected. I joined the nuclear navy

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.040
 in order to have a better chance to go to that school and I was

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.070
 doing really well, I was one of the top students in my class and I was

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.110
 really fit and in shape and I did everything the right way but when

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.150
 it came time to apply, I put that I wanted to do a humanities type

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.180
 job when really the Naval Academy expects you to have a technical

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.220
 job. So I said, "I think I want to major in economics or something because

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.260
 they can learn languages" and I didn't think it really mattered

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.290
 what you applied for. The only thing that matters is that you're

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.330
 an officer and then they will send you wherever. So, I thought maybe

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.370
 economics would be, like, a job that I could, like, kind of enjoy,

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.410
 and you know, I like the type of math that they do and, you know, it's

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.440
 kind of business oriented but really, they want electronics technicians

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.480
 and math people and computer science people, you know, more than

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.520
 economics, so. The XO called me and he's like, "Well, you know,

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.550
 if you would have done that, then maybe we would have considered that."

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.590
 So, it feels like, ever since that day, I should, like, I wanted

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.630
 to go back in time and kind of change what I put on my recommendation

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.660
 so that I could've actually went to this really high level school

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.700
 and it didn't work out that way. So, instead I was a nuclear technician

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.740
 for eight years and I learned lots of things. I'm very happy for

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.780
 the job that I eventually did instead but if I had to do it again,

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.810
 then I guess I would have tried to make a better shot for the Naval

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.850
 Academy.
