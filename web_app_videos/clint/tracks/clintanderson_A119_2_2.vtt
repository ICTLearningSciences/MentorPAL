The best information that I could give you if you're trying to understand

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.300
 what you should do for your future career is to learn as much information

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.530
 about it as possible. So for me I joined the nuclear technician

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.760
 field and I didn't even know what they did. I thought we were

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.990
 going to be working on nuclear bombs and I think if I would have known

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.210
 a little bit more about it then I would've had better jump start

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.440
 for my career. So for instance if I knew about like, that the nuclear

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.670
 technology field dealt with the internals of making nuclear power

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.900
 with uranium, then I would study more about that, and my schooling would

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.120
 had a better, I would've understood my schooling a lot better.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.350
 If I would have picked up a little bit of electrician knowledge beforehand,

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.580
 like for instance, I had no idea what the difference between

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.800
 voltage and current was until I was midway in my A school, my initial

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.030
 school learning. So it would be really nice if I would have understood

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.260
 some of those basic concepts before I started the school. My grades

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.490
 would have been higher, I would have gotten more awards, maybe

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.710
 I would've understood the material, the complex material that was being

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.940
 presented to me in a much, in a much better way if I would've had

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.170
 like fifty or sixty percent knowledge beforehand. So I wouldn't have

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.400
 missed out on all of those like. those minor advanced topics during

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.620
 class. So I guess my advice is learn about your job before you go

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.850
 into it.
