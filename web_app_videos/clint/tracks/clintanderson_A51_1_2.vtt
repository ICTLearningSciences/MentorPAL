00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.520
So, for the eight years that I've been in the US Navy active duty service,

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.180
 I've seen everyone have high stress symptoms. I, myself, am in

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.850
 included in that, several times. So, these working hours can be really

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.520
 long and there have been many times when I just wanted to say, "Hey,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.180
 you know, I just want to go to my bed and relax and sleep and not

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.850
 have anyone tell me what to do" but the difference between a military

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.520
 person and a civilian is that it's ingrained in us to take orders.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.180
 So, regardless of how I feel, at the end of the day, I'm going to

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.850
 do my work. Maybe a civilian person would quit their job, maybe a civilian

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.520
 person would yell at their boss but military people, they don't

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.180
 do that. That's our culture. So, you live with it. You live with

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.850
 the stress that comes with the job.
