00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.590
How much free time you have really depends on the type of job that you're

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.320
 doing. If you're in this uniform, that means, when you're stationed

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.060
 on land, that means you probably have a nine to five job. You get

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.800
 off and you go home and you do your own thing. When you're on deployment,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.530
 then your free time goes from maybe eight hours later in the

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.270
 day down to maybe two or three. You don't have that much free time.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.010
 During those times, you really suck them, you really suck the juice

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.740
 out of them, so you're watching DVDs or you're drumming down in, like,

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.480
 the basement or you're just sitting back, relaxing, watching some

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.220
 TV or reading a comic or something like that and the two or three

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.960
 hours, you really make the most use of it. When you are, when I got

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.690
 out of the military and I started going to school full-time, then, I

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.430
 guess my days were a little bit easier. Going to school full-time,

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.170
 that's about thirty hours to sixty hours, depending on whether you're

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.900
 taking the easy class or hard class. But even for me, when I was taking

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.640
 easier classes, then I try to find part-time work, to add on the

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.380
 extra twenty or thirty hours to it. So, all my time was about sixty

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.110
 hours per week, consistently for last few years, either just full-time

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.850
 student or full-time with part-time work.
