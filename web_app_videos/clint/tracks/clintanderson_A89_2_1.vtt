00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.890
With nuclear energy, maybe because I have a bias because I went through

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.930
 the program but what's really pushed upon us is that it's very safe.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.970
 It's one of the safest ways to make energy that we have. Now there

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.020
 is a concern about nuclear waste and of course you know we have nuclear

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.060
 waste at the end of an aircraft carrier's life cycle, but it's

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.100
 controlled in a certain spot and we put in the middle of the ground

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.140
 as opposed so let's say charcoal which produces fumes in the air as

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.180
 opposed to sunlight which doesn't provide the energy for the surface

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.230
 area that it has , to produce as much as the nuclear power that is.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.270
 As opposed to wind which requires these big things in far off places.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.310
 So nuclear technology can be built anywhere in a safe manner, and

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.350
 in fact the navy has a history of zero incidents of nuclear failures

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.390
 in the navy's history, so we're really proud of that. I think that

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.430
 nuclear technology should be the way to go for our future energy needs;

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.470
 however, I do understand people's hesitation with taking on nuclear

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.520
 power, especially with the thing that happened in Japan-the great

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.560
 Japanese earthquake in 2001. So it's been a big problem to try to

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.600
 pick up all of the all the pieces there. They still have problems

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.640
 with it, even though it has been you know like eight years later. However

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.680
 that took a huge natural disaster to cause a problem that day,

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.730
 so whether it's charcoal whether it's sunlight you know no matter what,

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:51.770
 when you have a big earthquake like that then that is going to

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.810
 happen but otherwise nuclear power is one of the safest ways to make

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.850
 energy that I know of, and that's what we are taught.
