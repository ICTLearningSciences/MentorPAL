00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.100
I went to college after I did the military. I think that's one way to

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.350
 do it, but you have a wide range of opportunities for college. If you

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.600
 ask if you should go to college before you start serving that depends

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.850
 on what you wanna do. If you wanna have a very good enlisted career,

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.100
 and you don't plan on becoming an officer then I suggest that you

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.350
 join the military right away. Officers need a college degree, so

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.600
 if you get the college degree first then you can become an officer as

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.850
 soon as you join the military. You can apply to become an officer

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.100
 and every year thereafter, however you probably wouldn't start your

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.350
 career four years later. So that could be a hindrance if you wanna have

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.600
 a full enlisted career. For people that aren't sure what the what

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.850
 they want to do, I still suggest that they join the military right

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.100
 away because you can go to school while you're in the military. I took

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.350
 a few classes myself. So if you decide that college isn't for you then

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.600
 you didn't waste those four years. Also military college can

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.850
 be free in many cases. It can be very very cheap, they have the tuition

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.100
 assistance that can reduce the price by a few thousand dollars or

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.350
 ultimately make it free and you can down take lots of classes during

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.600
 your off time. So that means you can kill two birds with one stone,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.850
 you can get the work experience and you can do college at night time.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.100
 For some people like me, I didn't want the military work to interfere

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.350
 with my school. I wanted to get As, so that's why even though

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.600
 I wanted to go to school the entire time that I was in the military,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.850
 I waited until I got out so I could use the Montgomery GI Bill, so

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.100
 I could go to a very expensive university, and so that I could really

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.350
 focus on my school without worrying about work in the middle. So

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.600
 between going to school in the beginning if you want to become an officer,

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.850
 going to school during your career if you're thinking about making

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.100
 the military a career itself, or doing college at the very end,

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.350
 so you can enjoy the Montgomery GI Bill, the post 9-11 benefits, and

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.600
 all the free stuff. You have to decide where you fit in that range.
