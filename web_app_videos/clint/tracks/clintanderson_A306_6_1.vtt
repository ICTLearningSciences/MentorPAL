A school is the initial training that most enlisted people have before

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.740
 they go to their first ship. My school was electrician's making school

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.180
 it lasted for six months and then I had several other schools after

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.630
 that but A school can range from just a couple of weeks to six or

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.070
 seven months just like any other school, it's eight hours per day

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.520
 five days a week and there's lots of homework involved as well. By the

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.960
 end of it if you don't know your job that well, or anything about

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.410
 your job, by the end of the class you should be entry level at least.
