00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.470
The salaries that the military people make, they kind of range in how

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.100
 they compare to what civilians make. So officers kind of make slightly

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.730
 less than their civilian counterparts. That is, an officer you can

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.350
 take any officer and put them in a civilian job and they'd probably

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.970
 be making about ten to twenty thousand dollars more in the civilian

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.600
 sector. However, there's a lot of job security that comes with being

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.230
 in the military. You're not going to get fired unless you like really

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.850
 messed up. Now that you're protecting our country and you're doing

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.470
 it in an efficient manner you know, you're doing it effectively.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.100
 So there's a cost with that and the cost is our salary, so there is

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.730
 a saying that the military don't make that much, and it can be true

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.350
 in some cases. However if you do it with pride and you enjoy you work

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.970
 and you think about the excellent retirement benefits that they give

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.600
 you, you'll see that maybe by the end of your twenty years you know,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.230
 you didn't make that much less, however you have a much more fulfilling

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.850
 career. For enlisted people, it could very very similar or

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.470
 even better than your civic counterparts, at least for nuclear technicians

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.100
 we made a lot less than our civilian counterparts.  In fact many

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.730
 people get out after six or eight years and then they start working

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.350
 and they could easily make double what they're making. That is they

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.970
 leave as a first class petty officer making about sixty five or

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.600
 seventy thousand dollars a year and then they can make double that working

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.230
 as Homer Simpson you know down at the nuclear power plant. Other

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.850
 things like maybe a cook or Boatsmen's Mate or let's say a weapons

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.470
 handler, they can find very very similar jobs out there so then they

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.100
 have the choice. Do I stay in the military that I've already put

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.730
 in like maybe six or seven years, or I do I become a civilian, maybe

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.350
 have to start all over, but start at a higher rate and higher job

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.970
 position than I would have if I would just join from high school. So

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.600
 many people in that position they probably stay in military because

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.230
 the retirements, and the amount of time they put in as far as their

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.850
 pride you know. All of that makes them stay in so.
