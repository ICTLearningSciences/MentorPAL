00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.850
If you don't know what job you want to do, then my suggestion is that

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 try to push yourself to try to do as hard a job as possible. You can

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.850
 always go down but in many cases it's very hard to go up. So for instance

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 if you pick a simple job like let's say picking plants. I don't

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.850
 mean to discredit any plant pickers out there, but if your job is

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.850
 to pick plants, and then all of sudden you want to be a computer scientist,

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 let's say, it might be hard to try to make that switch. You

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 don't have the skills to do computer science, you don't have the background,

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.850
 you might not have the right way to think about the world.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.850
 However, I think as a computer scientists, if I wanted to, I could

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.850
 be a very, very good plant picker, so you can always go down but it's

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 hard to go up.
