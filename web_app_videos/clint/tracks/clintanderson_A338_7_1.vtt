00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.500
If you're interested in becoming an officer, there are many ways to do

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.150
 it. One of the most popular routes is to go to the Naval Academy. Every

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.800
 enlisted, I'm sorry, every military branch has their own service

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.450
 academy, even the Coast Guard. The Marines go to the Naval Academy,

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.100
 Navy goes to the Naval Academy, Army people go to West Point. So they

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.750
 each have their own service academy for four years, and they take

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.400
 17 to 23 year olds. You can also do ROTC, which is not. The military

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.050
 branch, you can go to normal schools, and they pay for your education,

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.700
 you just have to show up to some military classes, and basically

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.350
 they give you a salary and they ask you to spend five years at the

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.000
 end of that service doing some kind of military work. You can also

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.650
 join the military and be there for a few months, a year or two, and

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.300
 then during that time, you can actually go into the officer route.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.950
 So they, if you're a good sailor, if you have a good evaluation and

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.600
 they think that you're tip-top, then they will suggest you to go to

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.250
 the officer route. In that case you go to a one of the schools that

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.900
 they select. There are several other ways as well, there's officer candidate

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.550
 school and there's direct commissioned officer. There's also

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.200
 limited duty officer and chief one officer for the Navy. But those

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.850
 are just some ways that you can become an officer.
