00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.030
One of the fun stories that I have was when I was in Australia I started,

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.220
 I started to gamble. I never gambled before I wanted to see if I

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.400
 could take one thousand dollars and make ten thousand dollars. I said

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.590
 you know, I'm going to into this five star hotel you know, gambling

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.770
 on the bottom and I said I can stop. Ten thousand dollars that's

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.960
 enough for a car. I will come back and I won't gamble anymore I'll go

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.140
 out into the world. I had this trick that I could do for roulette

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.320
 which is like you take one dollar and if you lose it then you bet two

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.510
 dollars, if you lose it then you bet four dollars, if you lose then

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.690
 you bet eight dollars and eventually you're gonna win you know. Even

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.880
 if you lose lose lose lose lose lose lose lose lose, if you win on

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.060
 that tenth time as long as you keep doubling then you get all your

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.240
 money back and you know. So anyways I tried this trick. So we went

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.430
 to Australia and I was down in the bottom of the hotel and I was there

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.610
 for maybe seven hours six hours on my roulette wheel. So I started

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.800
 off with a hundred, I actually did Black Jack and I got into like

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.980
 two three hundred and I started roulette you know with my special trick

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.170
 and I got it up to two thousand dollars. So I'm like "ah I'm on

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.350
 my way you know it actually does work." So I went up to my room for

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.530
 that night, I was drinking champagne in the bathtub like watching TV

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.720
 you know and then I thought like wait a second I'm in Australia. Clint.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.900
 Did you just spend your whole day in the gambling in a little you

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.090
 know off to the side hotel and gambling spot you know like like you

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.270
 can gamble in Las Vegas come on you know you should you should get

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.460
 out there and try to explore the country some. So the next day I go

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.640
 back down there and it's so funny there's this old lady who was there

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.820
 and she was there the night before, right. I went up to you know

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.010
 like take a nap and drink and I came back and she was still gambling

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.190
 right. So she was gambling on the hundred dollar chip tables and before

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.380
 I was doing like ten, ten dollar tables so I was like you know

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.560
 what? Here is my money let me go ahead and you know try to get this

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.740
 ten thousand dollars as fast as possible. So I go to right beside her,

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.930
 you know she is the only one at the table. Start betting hundred

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.110
 dollars, hundred dollars, hundred dollars. It's all gone. Whoop- bye

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.300
 two thousand dollars. I mean I left and I enjoyed Australia so. I

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.480
 like that story because it taught me to not be scared of losing money. Money

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.670
 didn't have that power over me that I did when I was, when

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.850
 I was a kid.
