00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.790
I think that that the navy change the world, the military can change the

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.740
 world, and ultimately America can change the world if we use the money

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.680
 that we are spending for the military wisely. So America spends

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.630
 I think six hundred billion dollars per year, which is from what I

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.570
 understand several times more than any other country. It's maybe the

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.520
 next six countries combined total, that's what the military spends.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.460
 So what are we using that money for I would say that it's policing

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.410
 the world. We make sure that we have a huge military so that there

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.350
 aren't huge fights breaking out all over the world like it used to be

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.290
 two hundred three hundred years ago because there wasn't a main force.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.240
 Then you have England attack France, Iraq attack Saudi Arabia,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.180
 I'm making up countries but you understand that there wasn't a global

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.130
 force for good making sure that everybody isn't going crazy with all

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:10.070
 the attacking. So yes America does attack itself too and there's

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.020
 an ideology behind that. But ultimately as long as America can control

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.960
 the huge fights that break out then I'd say that people for the most

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.910
 part in most countries will appreciate that protection that we are

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.850
 providing.
