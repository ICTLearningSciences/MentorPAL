My name is Clint. I was born in California, Los Angeles. I traveled around

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.850
 the world when I was a kid. By the time I got to high school at

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.350
 eighteen, this was, I didn't really have too much family so I was just

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.850
 kind of alone in the world. And in 2000, when I was twenty, I joined

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.350
 the navy. I stayed in the navy as a nuclear technician for eight

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.850
 years, from 2000 to 2008, then I joined the reserves and I started

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.350
 going to college. Undergraduate was University of California Berkeley.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.850
 I did that for about five years or so, and then I started going

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.350
 to the University of Southern California to get my masters in computer

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.850
