If you want to be successful in your education, if you want to be a good

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.180
 student, this is what I found personally for myself. It's, you have

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.350
 to know your weaknesses, you have to know what you're lacking in.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.520
 If you're in a math class, you know multivariable calculus and you

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.680
 get a D on a test, then you gotta say, "Okay, well, where did I mess

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.850
 up? I didn't study enough I should've opened the book earlier."  If

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.020
 you get another D, then that's the time that you need to start asking

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.180
 for help, you need to start going to the professor, going to your

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.350
 teaching assistants or research assistants and, trying to get, suck

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.520
 up as much information as you can to not make the same mistake. So

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.680
 once you find your own flaw, you need to 'pound it out' and get back

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.850
 on the right track.
