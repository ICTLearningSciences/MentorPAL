00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.000
Personally, I don't know anyone that I knew by name that has died in the

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.160
 military. However, I have witnessed, well not witnessed, I have known

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.310
 of people who have gotten seriously injured. So for instance, someone

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:21.470
 that I spent a couple years with on my first aircraft carrier,

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.620
 that person became a chief, and he went to the next ship and unfortunately

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.770
 he was in a very large circuit breaker accident. All the navy

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.930
 heard about it, and it especially affected his last ship. We all

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.080
 knew him. That's just one example. Every now and then you hear about

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.230
 people falling down stairs or you know running down and like hitting

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.390
 their head on one of the thin windows, the thin sills of the doors.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.540
 Or gettting their fingers trapped in some kind of door. Or minorly

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.700
 some electrocutions, but death I haven't experienced so much of yet.
