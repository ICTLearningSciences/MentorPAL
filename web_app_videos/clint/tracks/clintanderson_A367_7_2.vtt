Leave in the military is great. For every year that you're in you, get

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:11.250
 thirty days. You can do that, you can save up your leave, to a maximum

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.450
 of two months. There's also lots of different leaves that you can

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.650
 take, terminal leave, job finding leave, house hunting leave. It's,

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.850
 they give you lots of time off to do the things you want to do.
