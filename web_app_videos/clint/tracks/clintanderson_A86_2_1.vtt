00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.170
So when you come into the military from day one you are provided with

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.490
 many opportunities to grow and expand yourself. So, even in boot camp,

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.800
 some of the tasks that they provide for you, that they ask you to

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.120
 do are kind of complex. So some people, let's say they were really

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.440
 good in high school. It can be very easy for them, they understand the

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.760
 math that's involved, they understand how how the physics works,

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.080
 how to tie the knot. But for some people it could be the first time

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.400
 that they've ever seen it in their lives. Maybe they've never even been

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.710
 on a ship before you know so be a lot harder for them. So, the cool

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.030
 thing about the navy is that it gives you all the resources that

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.350
 you need, hands down. So if you don't need it then you probably won't

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.670
 use it but if you do need it then it's all a matter of asking a chief

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.990
 "Hey where can I get help" or a matter of going to your local library

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.300
 and getting that book. The biggest thing is that there's gonna

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.620
 be someone to your left and someone to your right that can work with

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.940
 you hand in hand to make sure that you complete your job. But what

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.260
 the Navy doesn't want is someone who can't do their job who is trying

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.580
 to do their job because that's gonna get someone killed. So they

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.900
 make sure that whether it's tying a knot or painting a ship or it's

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.210
 going down and fixing the pump they're gonna make sure that you can

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.530
 complete your job and if there's any question to it then they're not

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.850
 gonna allow you to do it so.
