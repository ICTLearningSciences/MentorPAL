00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.950
I've been in stem careers since I graduated from high school one way or

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.050
 the other that's a literal truth and I've really enjoyed all of the

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.150
 work I've done stem and I enjoy it still to this day did thing that

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.250
 I would really like to see the different about stem is I wish government

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.350
 sometimes who's a little more responsive to supporting the stem

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.450
 research it will make a difference so frequently the government takes

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.550
 the approach of we need to pass a law and keep somebody from doing

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.650
 it rather than that we need to fund some research than we can encourage

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.750
 people to do the right thing rather than trying to force them

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.850
 to do the right thing
