00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.130
when you think you are picking a college sometimes you look ahead at your

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.410
 career and think what difference will it make and sometimes it makes

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.690
 very little difference very little difference at all for instance

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.970
 at the bachelor's level generally virtually any college in the country

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.250
 we'll give you a decent education allow you to go on to your career

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.530
 on post graduate work but there are some colleges that have a

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.810
 better name than others if you want to go into graduate work for instance

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.090
 you might be much better advised to go to Stanford if you can

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.370
 get into Stanford then you would be the going to cal state LA it's not

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.650
 that you would be a whole lot better educated at Stanford although

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.930
 that's probably too but it's just that when you get ready to go the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.210
 people looking at you will consider that school and the same is true

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.490
 with even your postgraduate work I went to the university of Colorado

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.770
 for law school and I was worried about my class rank going through

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.050
 law school and yet the lawyer who was in private practice told me

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.330
 he had practiced law for fifty years and never will what's never once

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.610
 had any client ever asking where he went to law school and was class

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.890
 rank words now it's not always true and that lawyer not mortgage

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.170
 do private practice but wanted to become a Supreme Court justice or

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.450
 a professor at Harvard Law School then the school to which he went

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.730
 would be very critical and his gray drakes with very critical so sometimes

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.010
 it makes a big difference times it doesn't make much difference

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.290
 at all by and large most people will never know where you did your

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.570
 work in school and they won't know whether you did well or poorly

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.850
 intrinsic GPA
