No matter what professional field you get into you will probably have

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.110
 a number of professional organizations they can be of assistance to

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.740
 you in doing your job and getting promoted. Sometimes these may be associations,

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.370
 professional associations, sometimes they may be sections

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:24.000
 of the military for instance they're in charge of getting you trained

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.630
 and educated to move up the ranks so you have to be alerted. So

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.260
 in my case I was able to move ahead in the military because there were

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.890
 a number of schools that were set up in their number of curricula

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.520
 set up that would encourage you to proceed further in cryptology about

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.150
 a lot of the work and if you could tell cryptology was personal

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.780
 study you know I could talk to you for hours about the history of cryptology

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.410
 and the military throughout the ages and and that was all

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.040
 part of my skill as a cryptologist. I also have studied a plethora of

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.660
 foreign languages so that when we were in Vietnam for instance I was

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.290
 to go to the linguist when somebody heavy foreign language they recognize

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.920
 they would bring it to me and say what languages is it and

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.550
 I would be able to tell not because that military training helped me

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.180
 learn that because my own private study had exposed me to those languages

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.810
 someplace where I can remember what they were like and that was

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.440
 that was useful. In the civilian world, the association of computing

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.070
 machinery (ACM) which is the major professional organization for

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.700
 people doing research in the computers and computer usage and they've

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.330
 been very good about keeping me informed about what's going on what

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.960
 jobs are available. So find out what your field has for professional

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.590
 organization and join up you should do that. In the Navy, I belong

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.220
 to the Naval institute which publishes proceedings which is a monthly

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.850
 magazine discussing naval issues also important to me.
