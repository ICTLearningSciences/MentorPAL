00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.730
If you are in the Naval Services you'll hear people talking about saying

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.600
 I was in port. Which means I was not out at sea and then in port

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.470
 can mean your at your home base or could mean your important at a port

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.350
 call at a foreign country or a different port from your own base

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.230
 but in the United States. In the marine corps the equivalent would be

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.100
 on base at my home base which means I'm on where I usually am I can

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.970
 get out and do liberty take some relaxation as opposed to being on

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.850
 deployment or so busy that I never have time to myself.
