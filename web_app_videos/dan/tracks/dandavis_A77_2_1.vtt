Each branch of the military has its own personality within them. The branches

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.920
 of the military have their own personality. The personality

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.450
 of the people in cryptology were different the personality of the guys

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.980
 we're in aviation. And they were different from the guys who were

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.520
 in the infantry units in the Marine Corps. But the marine corps has

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.050
 a personality that is largely let's figure out where we're going to

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.580
 and then let's go there come hell or high water. So the they're very

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.120
 very much let's get something happening and that's that differentiates

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.650
 from so many of the other services. Here the navy on the other

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.180
 hand, I think in their personality is largely we have huge complex and

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.720
 interdependent sets of equipment and systems on ships. And therefore

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.250
 we must be very technical. We must understand each other's jobs.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.780
 We must know exactly what the other guy whose job is and how is equipment

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.320
 works. And we as best we can, we need to be able to fill in for

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.850
 him if he can't do his job. And so so that there's a kind of a almost

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.380
 a technical orientation the probably goes back to the good old

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.920
 days where you know the people who were allowed to go aloft and set

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.450
 to sales had to know what they were doing. They were just following

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.980
 directions they had to know how to sail a ship in order there was going

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.520
 to be big trouble. So there isn't a difference there. the airforce

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.050
 is oriented toward getting the pilots in the sky and recovered aircraft

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.580
 and that leads to kind of the separation of pilots and then the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.120
 Russian airforce. But it's a separation of works well because everybody's

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.650
 place seeing together. The army is so diverse it's hard to

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.180
 see any single personality. But there is that solid feeling that, "hey

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.720
 we are the guys who really gets the job done and make it happen,"

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.250
 everybody else holds out you can drop bombs you could sales there in

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.780
 your ships. You know the Marines can help us get ashore, but when

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.320
 it comes time to move across the land and we're the guys who have to

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.850
 get it done and so we are the guys you have to rely on.
