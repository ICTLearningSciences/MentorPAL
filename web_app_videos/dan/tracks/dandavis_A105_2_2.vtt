There were a couple of problems going through any group there are bullys

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.380
 in every group and the bully will always target the people who he

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.650
 thinks he can bully the easiest this makes it tough on everybody I've

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.920
 never been on the aggressive fighter never been particularly athletic

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.180
 so I've been the target of a lot of bullies in my life. You know

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.450
 it's hard to put up with it but hardly ever fatal or hardly ever leads

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.720
 to any kind of permanent injury, I think organizations should be

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.980
 alert to bullying and take care of it better, but for individuals

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.250
 I think the best thing to do is just look inside yourself, think about

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.520
 what's bothering you think about whether it really matters, often

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.780
 the bully is relying on the fact you'll be embarrassed to have been

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.050
 pushed around by somebody and if you don't care I can laugh off or

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.320
 make a joke about it often they'll go away and leave you alone god help

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.580
 you if you've been bullied if I'm around let me know I'd help you

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.850
 to.
