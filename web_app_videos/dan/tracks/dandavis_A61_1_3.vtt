00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.330
some of us are born loving technology and were more loving people and

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.800
 it just seems like we never have enough time for either one of them

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.280
 or both so the question is in the kinds of work I've done how much time

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.750
 do you spend sitting with technology and how much time do you spend

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.230
 with people I would have to tell you in both my military and then

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.710
 civilian careers I spent probably equal amounts of time with both

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.180
 those and I enjoyed that kind of balance in my life in my military time

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.660
 there were lots of times we working it technically sure cryptologic

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.140
 issue where you had to work alone and you had to tune out anybody

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.610
 who's around but on the other hand almost everything I've done in

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.090
 the military including best kind of analysis was done in a room full

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.560
 of people doing the same sorts of things I was doing and people whom

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.040
 you could turn and say Hey Joe have you been able to figure out how

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.520
 the Abercrombie from food network's the need to know Dan how about

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.990
 this one and you work it out together on the other hand as a civilian

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.470
 yet nothing I love to do more than sit at my computer and I am in

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.950
 the flow doing code that the world just goes away but when the other

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.420
 things I love to do is go to a conference in running the booth and

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.900
 talking everybody who comes to my boots but kinda work we do so I love

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.370
 both in again civilian military fifty fifty technology and people
