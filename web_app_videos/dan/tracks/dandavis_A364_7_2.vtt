00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.070
my experience in both industry and academia is a lot of people come up

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.290
 with a really unique idea yeah if we do this that will allow us to

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.520
 do that and they think well wow I could make some money with that that's

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.740
 a sellable ideas and so they quit either industry they're working

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.960
 for the quit academia and they go starter on business and some of

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.180
 them famously have gotten terribly terribly rich doing that just unimaginably

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.410
 rich and those the people you hear about all the time but

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.630
 my experience is been the vast majority of those people go away and

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.850
 then five to ten years later they're back they're back in their living

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.070
 in an apartment now and not their house anymore because they had

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.290
 to mortgage their house to try to keep your business going and it didn't

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.520
 go and they didn't quite make it so it turns out there's a skill

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.740
 set to running a business is a little different than a skill set

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.960
 to be the researcher and having some really good ideas that might be

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.180
 good ideas %HESITATION so people who go through life see that happened

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.410
 a lot of their friends and so one of them say if I have a good idea

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.630
 I'll try to sell it to somebody because I'm not a businessman I

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.850
 might not do a very good job of running my own business
