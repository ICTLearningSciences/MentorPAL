00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.240
Sometimes the original choice you made for a branch of the service was

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.630
 based on erroneous notion of what they would be doing and after you've

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.020
 served, while especially if you've served with some of the other

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.420
 branches you may say "gosh I wish I hadn't joined service A, I wish

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.810
 I'd join service B instead". If that happens what are the options you

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.200
 have and I would have to tell you they're pretty limited. If you

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.590
 signed on the dotted line saying I will serve for six to eight years

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.980
 what have you signed for in service a. They put a lot of money and

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.370
 you investing in boot camp for your non productive and in your training

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.760
 where you're non productive and they finally got to the point where

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.150
 you're productive, they're disinclined to say "well okay we'll just

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.550
 call it even and you can go join another armed force". So it's very

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.940
 very difficult to change forces except between enlistments. I enlisted

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.330
 originally in the marine corps, did four years active duty then

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.720
 did two years of non pay reserve duty, in which I was going to drills

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.110
 but not getting paid for it. But I finished up my entire six year

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.500
 enlistment before I got my honorable discharge from themarine corps,

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.890
 reenlisted but in the Navy, enlisted the navy as an enlisted person

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.280
 then got commissioned later on. That worked out fine, the marine

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.680
 corps is happy, the navy's happy, the only problem is mine marine corps

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.070
 buddies arent happy because that they consider that an act of treason

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.460
 for me to join the Navy. They would've been happier if I'd join

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.850
 the Russian army that for me to have joined the Navy
