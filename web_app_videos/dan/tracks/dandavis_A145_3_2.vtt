When I enlisted in the marine corps, you only had two choices; you did

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.680
 very well on the way entry test, even the recruiters office you could

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.100
 pick aviation options. That meant you're for sure you would not go

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.520
 in the infantry, you'd go in an anaviation option of some kind or

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.930
 another. These days things have changed entirely, the different services

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.350
 have different ways of testing you ahead of time and can guarantee

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.770
 you occupational field. So I'm not exactly sure how that works so

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.180
 I would urge you to talk to your recruiter about that and don't put

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.600
 up with "well yeah I'll usually or frequently, or maybe, you know"

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.020
 what are they guaranteeing you is going to happen. You can't get it

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.430
 in writing but at least pin them down to not just give you fluffy statements

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.850
 but to say yes this will happen.
