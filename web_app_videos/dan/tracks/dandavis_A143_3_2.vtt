00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.350
Attire in the navy has changed some since I was on active duty. Used to

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.850
 be you had to wear your dress uniform a lot more than you do now it

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.350
 used to be against regulations to run around and your utility a work

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.850
 uniform, now everybody seems they camouflage work uniforms or just

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.350
 the berries and they wear them all the time they wear them in downtown.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.850
 So things things change, I am currently wearing the shirt to dress

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.350
 blue uniform over which you typically wear the blue coat double

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.850
 breasted brass buttoned blue coat. But it in an office setting you

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.350
 take them off and just have your raw shoulder boards showing your rank,

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.850
 in this case I'm a commander that has three stripes, and a star

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.350
 showing that I am an on-officer that is I'm a fighter, not the staff

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.850
 officer like a chaplain or a lawyer jag corps, or medical corps, dental

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.350
 corps, Pleiku, or those sorts of things are considered staff office
