The gender mix in the navy is in transition, when I was in there or and

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:12.250
 the active duty and and to some degree in reserve duty there was a

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.950
 great preponderance of males. I remember we got our first female cryptologist

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.650
 and the navy reserve and than now cryptologic field has the

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.350
 good portion of them, and I would not even hazard a guess as to how

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:35.050
 many are in cryptology now, but you could probably get those numbers

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.750
 from your recruit, but I would I would think on the order of twenty

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.450
 five percent of cryptologists now are females. The other areas are

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:52.150
 similar more and more fields have become open to females, I knew

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.850
 one of the original fighter pilots who was female in the navy
