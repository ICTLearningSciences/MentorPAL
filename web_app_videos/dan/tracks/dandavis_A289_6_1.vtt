00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.300
if you're making a crude choice remember this there is no best career

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.760
 for everyone there is a tendency in our society to think a career where

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.210
 you can make the most money is the best career or their career we'll

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.670
 have the more status the best career and we all know jokes about

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.120
 mothers breaking on their son the doctor you know so a physician is

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.580
 a very good honorable career it's a lot of people who are not cut

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.030
 out to be position so the most miserable people I know are people who

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.490
 positions or lawyers accountants found even though they could do it

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.940
 even though they were good at the hated and it just did not make them

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.400
 for Phil to do it one of my professors in law school was a physician

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.850
 first and he said being a physician was not challenging you know

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.300
 you've got the green nose in a purple tongue you get pill number fifty

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.760
 five next and so he wanted to do something where you can expand

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.210
 on what you not just follow the rules so the best careers the best

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.670
 career for you and that means you have to have self knowledge self analysis

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.120
 indeed factual understanding of what the varying careers actually

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.580
 do not the way the prettier dawn TV or in the movies but they

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.030
 really do every day and find out the one that fits your capabilities

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.490
 the best don't get second into the trap of I can do that so I should

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.940
 do that Lana ms will people I know can do calculus but don't like

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.400
 doing engineer they got into it because they could do it that's not

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.850
 where they're heartless
