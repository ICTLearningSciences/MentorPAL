00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.350
That's a rather complex issue actually I joined the navy after I got of

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.850
 the marine corps, after I had left college and worked for a couple

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.350
 of years I went and listed the marine corps spent four years on active

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.850
 duty, then finished up my six year obligation with two years of

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.350
 inactive reserve and then at that time I joined the Navy. So that would

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.850
 have been at that time 1973 when I enlisted in the navy and then

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.350
 I served in the navy for two years is in the list of man and was commissioned

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.850
 in 1975 and then finally retired in about 2003
