00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.520
it seems to me that the future of both of the fields in which I have participated

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.180
 cryptology and high performance computing will continue

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.850
 to grow and continue to be vital to the United States I think of the

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.520
 factors that may interrupt that would be some disruption of society

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.180
 in general that would cause the funding to fail in both those feels

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.850
 I think it anyone pursuing a stem career any those two fields a would

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.520
 be well advised to have a fall back position in mind so that they

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.180
 would know someplace else they can get a job if you those two fields

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.850
 becomes constrained
