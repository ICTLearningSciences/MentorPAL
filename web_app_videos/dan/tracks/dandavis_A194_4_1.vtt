00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.230
I've been very active in stem in both cryptology academia the major reason

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.600
 for leaving the stem fields involved in cryptology or the loss

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.970
 of a clearance and forcing you out or just for the travel gets to you

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.350
 and you you find the need to stabilize your life and stay put for

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.730
 awhile and the same to some degree is true for academia people leave

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.100
 this field only when they're forced to within my experience and being

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.470
 forced to means funding dries up and there's no one to pay for the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.850
 work you want
