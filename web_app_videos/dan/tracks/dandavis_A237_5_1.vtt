00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.620
all of us have challenges would we're in our life in challenges and education

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.390
 are the same as they are in the rest of life Aldous are blessed

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.160
 with certain capabilities I for instance was blessed with a decent

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.930
 mind that works pretty well all of us are to some degree damned by

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.700
 a failure in some of our personality traits I'm a poor organizer and

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.470
 a procrastinator and I and the some degree difficult person to get

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.230
 motivated to something that he doesn't really care about so it's it's

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.000
 kind of a mixed bag that you take any effort including going to

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.770
 college so the most difficult part of college to me before I went to

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.540
 the service was just staying with the program going to class read the

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.310
 book taken the test once I was in the service it occurred to me Hey

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.080
 this is easy if you do those things and I just get up and everything

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.850
 worked out
