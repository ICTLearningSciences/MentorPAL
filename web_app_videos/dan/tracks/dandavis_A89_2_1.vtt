When you talk about the environment you'll be facing once you get into

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.050
 a job that can vary all over the map both civilian and military life.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.150
 In military life I have done my technical tasks in a room full of

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.250
 electronic equipment in a carefully air conditioned and beautiful modern

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.350
 building with restrooms down the hall and a snack bar that I can

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.450
 get to easily and all the comforts of home. I've also done my job

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.550
 with a single radio and antenna in a tent in the cold weather in North

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.650
 America and I've also done my job in a bunker right on the DMZ in

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.750
 Vietnam where I was one of the few people in that area who even knew

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.850
 what I was doing for a living. So things change a lot of the military

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.950
 about the kind of technical environment you had in civilian life

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.050
 that technological environment in which I lived has always been a

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.150
 good one you know I've I've lived in modern buildings in modern offices

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.250
 stack of all the most modern equipment sometimes equiment so how

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.350
 off the press so to speak that nobody else in the world had that like

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.450
 the quantum computer we have here at USC there only two or three

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.550
 of those operational around the world we've got one of them so it it

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.650
 is been a joy to do that if you're in a smaller university or college

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.750
 of course it should be a little less plush but still very nice working

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.850
 and living conditions.
