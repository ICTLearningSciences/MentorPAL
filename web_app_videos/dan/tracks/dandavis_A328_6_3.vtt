00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.940
I believe in post secondary education that is going to college getting

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.030
 graduate degree I believe you should go as far as your intellectual

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.120
 capabilities will allow you and I believe you should keep going and

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.210
 I think that that's a good thing to do and I think it will get you

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.300
 ahead in the military as well and so it's a good thing to do in the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.400
 military so I think you probably shouldn't senator trying to do both

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.490
 simultaneously if at all possible because the military see stable life

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.580
 with good benefits and and good money so you can do military won't

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.670
 work and collegiate level work at the same time and still get the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.760
 benefits of money and that medical support for you and your family

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.850
 and a a AS
