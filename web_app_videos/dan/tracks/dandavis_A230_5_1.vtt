the still feels are amazing because of their multiplicity and because

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.350
 their diversity so there are a lot of places in stem where you can be

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.600
 useful I used to work at Caltech where everybody there was smarter

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.850
 than I was I mean I used to eat lunch with who had won the Nobel Prize

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.100
 and they were they good at math and science yes very good at math

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.350
 and science and yet they were always interested in my opinion of my

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.600
 thoughts and my ideas if I had a new idea that free will you ask me

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.850
 will tell us about that idea so they were they were they were able

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.100
 to keep me going even though maybe I wasn't quite as good as they were

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.350
 I've had people on projects with me who were not as good at math

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.600
 in science is silence and yet they were invaluable and added a lot

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.850
 so I think if you have an interest in it and it any kind of enjoyment

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.100
 it all in saw the stem fields you'll find a place for your intellectual

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.350
 capabilities your personality and your physical abilities will

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.600
 be important to the team and you will become a valued team member if

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.850
