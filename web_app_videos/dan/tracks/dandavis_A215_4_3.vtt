00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.120
all the wonderful things about both cryptology in high performance computing

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.380
 is it never stand still that means if you're in either of those

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.650
 two fields you better be a scholar you better be studying all the

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.920
 time you better be driven to learn new things you better be driven

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.180
 to master new skills and those who mash of those new skills and learn

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.450
 new techniques are the ones who will have the best job security the

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.720
 other thing you need to do as you get more senior in life is be aware

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.980
 that sometimes the technical skills will not be the ones you need

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.250
 to hone one of the things I've found in my own private research is

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.520
 the amount of English you spend time writing will go up significantly

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.780
 issue get senior the amount of code you get to write will go down

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.050
 because instead of writing subroutines and functions you'll be writing

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.320
 proposals and evaluations and technical article soon learn to hone

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.580
 the skills across the entire profession not just those that are practiced
