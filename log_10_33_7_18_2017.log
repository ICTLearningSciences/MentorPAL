Answer,Question
"Right now I am a ALT, which stands for assistant language teacher. I'm here in Japan, I teach English to elementary school kids and middle high school-middle school kids, not high school kids-and I also work for ICT at night time. I'm doing these video sessions. Also, I'm also doing a research for Touou university. I'm writing a paper that's going to be presented hopefully at a conference. Also, I am a part of this start up, we're making our own virtual reality videogame.",What do you do?
