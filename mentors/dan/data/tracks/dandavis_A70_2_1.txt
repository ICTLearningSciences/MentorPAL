00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.250
I am currently retired from the military which means I have completed

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.650
 these twenty good years and am eligible to retire. In my case, I did

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.050
 four years active duty in the Marine Corps and I've done about twenty

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.450
 good years in the reserves that means years where I went to drill

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.850
 once a month for an entire weekend and then did two weeks every year

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.250
 for training. More specialized training. I wound up putting a lot

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.650
 more time than that, but that was required for me to get some retirement

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.050
 status. So I am currently retired military, which means the President

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.450
 could call me back active duty if he ever wanted to. I am of

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.850
 an age where that might be pretty unlikely but I would have to say during

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.250
 World War Two people my age and physical fitness, I'd like to

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.650
 say I I'm pretty fit I can walk two miles I get around pretty well,

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.050
 I could be recalled active duty probably would be sent to the front

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.450
 line to do shooting but might be given a job instructing at the Roxy

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.850
 thing of that nature.
