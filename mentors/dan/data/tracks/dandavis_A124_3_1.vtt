00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.580
You know I think of the things that's true about high school is, when

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.320
 it comes to athletics there is a focus on the top ten percent of the

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.050
 class that is really good at some athletics. The varsity team players

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.780
 and not much else. I'm not particularly athletic and so there were

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.520
 no sport I particularly cared for. I played a little basketball because

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.250
 I'm tall and six six, but I can't run so I didn't like that very

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.980
 much didn't play the other team sports and so they just drift through

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.720
 life. As a young adult I found out about volleyball turns out and

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.450
 I'm a very good volleyball player. I even got accused of being a

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.180
 semi pro once during a volleyball match in the navy. So I can't say

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.920
 I'm very good at anything but I certainly did enjoy volleyball and if

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.650
 I was in charge of the world, I would change the way we do athletics

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.380
 in high school. I'd try to help everybody find a sport in which they

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.120
 could excel and play with joy instead of just paying attention to

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.850
 the varsity athletes and everybody else has to do calisthenics.
