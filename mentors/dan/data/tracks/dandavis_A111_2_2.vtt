00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.710
you may be wondering what you should do if you're uncertain about the

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.570
 future that's a toughie I remember when I was a high school junior I

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.430
 really didn't have any idea I don't want to go to college because everybody's

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.290
 going to college go to college I certainly never thought

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.160
 I want to be a cripple logic officer yeah I never thought I want to

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.020
 be a lawyer I want to be an academic and study high performance computing

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.880
 I never thought so I don't know what do you do if you have no

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.740
 draw I've do you know what you want to do just get a broader taste of

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.600
 life is you the military will give you a very broad taste of life

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.460
 and they give you to select like you did me putting me in cryptology

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.320
 that I never would've thought up but they said we figure because I

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.180
 was good at and what so get a broad taste of life I think that's a critical

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.040
 one last quick war story my eldest brother from the tiny was

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.910
 in junior high school wanted to be a veterinarian anyone to work on

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.770
 large farm animals and he wanted to work in a small town in the rocky

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.630
 mountain somewhere didn't care where the rocking that's all I wanted

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.490
 to so I went to the university of Illinois and got a degree and

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.350
 he went to the university of Illinois better in medical school and got

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.210
 a degree it's harder to get that that's cool Illinois than it is

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.070
 in the medical but he wanted to do that and they went to Wyoming and

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.930
 he became a large animal veterinarian in a small town we will Wyoming

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.790
 in the Rocky Mountains Andy hade he hated it anyone any good he was

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.660
 he was a good veterinarian anyone any good lovingly better day investments

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.520
 because running the veterinarian business is ninety percent

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.380
 being a salesman in being nice to people and being friendly and being

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.240
 people kind of a jovial guy that everybody got along he hated five

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.100
 years later quit and he went to work for a bunch of large firms that

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.960
 did research and better medical products and before you know it

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.820
 he lived in New York City on the East River doing basically legal work

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.680
 getting legal registration for better a medical drugs around the

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.540
 world after drug got registered in the U. S. to treat hoof and mouth

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.410
 disease that he'd go around the world if the other come countries to

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.270
 them recognize our rights to yeah he was basically a lawyer yeah that's

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.130
 what he did the rest of his life and he hoped it was fun exciting

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.990
 travel yeah completely different than what you want so you know

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.850
