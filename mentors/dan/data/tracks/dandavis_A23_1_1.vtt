One of the things that I think the military is very good as training I

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.650
 had excellent training when I was in the service- both basic infantry

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.550
 training and the technical training I had. I spent almost a year

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.450
 in Washington DC learning Vietnamese. I spent six months in Pensacola

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.350
 learning how to do Morse code so I could do that as well and then

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.250
 I had good training before I went to Vietnam which they called staging

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.150
 training, where they get you prepared to to fight if that's required

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.050
 of you. Training beyond that, had I stayed in, would have been excellent

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.950
 as well but when I got in the reserves I got good training

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.850
 every time I went on my two week duty or my weekend duty
