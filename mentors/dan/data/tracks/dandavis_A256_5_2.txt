if you go to college you're going to find some teachers no really click

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.150
 with you we gonna find some teachers who are the boring side in every

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.810
 field you'll find some teach who have their own personal issues

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.460
 are working through that don't make him a good fit to to if you're a

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.110
 large state school like I went to you can almost always find a different

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.760
 professor in that area and usually there are institutions organizations

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.420
 that publish this guy's good teacher was Mister so you can

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.070
 change if you have a really bad teacher but mostly you'll find the

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.720
 teachers your carpet and they have something to teach you and something

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.370
 you can learn from them so I think that's true we coasted difficulty

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.020
 I think again you have to learn to be within years I've never been

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.680
 a runner Ike would never be able to run a marathon I hate running

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.330
 where that had to do it in the service it has been painful to me I've

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.980
 been able to do it but I just don't like it so for me to go into

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.630
 physical education and try to teach people how to be long distance

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.280
 runners would be a bad choice I think all of us need to look at our

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.940
 own capabilities physical mental organizational and say if it's really

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.590
 difficult for me then maybe I should I'm in the wrong field if I

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.240
 have to be able to do this to be in this field why would I think I'd

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.890
 be happier once again those who so maybe a different feel choice to

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.550
 be the right thing to do I don't mean you need to Dodge every challenge

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.200
 it comes to your life but you have to be honest with yourself some

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.850
 and pick a different way
