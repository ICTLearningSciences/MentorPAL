00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.770
if you're interested in a stem career I think you'll find many of the

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.680
 branches of service are almost exclusively devoted to stem careers the

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.600
 navy and the airforce certainly are devoted that way and the army

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.520
 and the marine corps do have some infantry kinds of positions that

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.430
 take you away from your normal stem activities but even there the technology

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.350
 has caught up to the point where private in the infantry in

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.270
 both the marine corps and the army have to have a good grasp of science

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.180
 technology engineering and math just to use the technology that's

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.100
 provided to them so I think it's pretty wide open navy and the airforce

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.020
 have perhaps more simply devoted to stem but even the army has

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.930
 a lot of people cryptology for instance devoted stem tasks so virtually

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.850
 anywhere you want to go you'll find some stem opportunities
