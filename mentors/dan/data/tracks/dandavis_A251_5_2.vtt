fortunately all of us grew up in the country that provides pretty much

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.290
 free education up to the high school level and after high school education

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.020
 can be incredibly expensive but there are a lot of different

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.740
 ways to pay for it and their ways to get education on the cheek as

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.460
 they say in California where I live now you can get a very good start

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.180
 at a four year degree and junior colleges I community college city

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.910
 colleges they're all go by different names but a two year schools and

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.630
 the education there is just as good as it is at the big schools live

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.350
 three daughters and all of them the one time or another took courses

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.070

 UC Davis and the university of southern California all good schools

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.240
 and yet they said the education they got in their summers at a

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.960
 community colleges which justice challenging and justice will present

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.680
 itself but there wide even ways for you to pay for an education you

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.410
 just gotta go scattered out go don't just take what people say you

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.130
