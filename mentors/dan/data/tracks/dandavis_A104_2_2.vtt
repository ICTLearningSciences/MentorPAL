00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.100
I have a lot of sympathy for people who don't do well in school I was

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.350
 a terrible high school studen, my high school adviser told me I had

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.600
 good test scores but I was no achievement and I would never amount to

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.850
 anything after two years of college the University of Colorado the

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.100
 dean asked me to go away for a couple years, I went into the Marine

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.350
 Corps when I came back I did a lot better I'll tell you that for sure,

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.600
 so I've I've known about struggling in school I think growing up

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.850
 helps a lot if you've got intellectual capability but you are having

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.100
 trouble getting your nose to the grindstone tour the service, a kind

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.350
 of arduous duty of any kind I think would be good advice for you

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.600
 because you need more than just a well I'm gonna change you need something

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.850
 that's really going to change you.
