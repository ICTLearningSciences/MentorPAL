they're a lot of choruses you'll be asked to take in any field of study

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.280
 that you'll never be able to think later on played really use that

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.490
 particular skill but just learning the skill is developing a skill

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.710
 of its own if you think in terms of how you think and how you learn

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.920
 every learning spirits you have helped you learn other things later

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.140
 on learning a language like snowball which I did when I was a sophomore

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.350
 in college nobody uses snowball anymore it's been superseded by

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.560
 much better languages in a much more common but learning the language

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.780
 was a good one for me because it told me a lot about string manipulation

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.990

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.210
 these days showed but it is true a lot of my friends have college textbooks

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.420
 on there bookshelf and they say heaven open that textbooks it's

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.640
 a love school because it's not good knowledge it's in the book it

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.850
 was it was learning the knowledge and that skills
