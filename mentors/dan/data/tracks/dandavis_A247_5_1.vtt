if you go through your career I think you'll find there a lot of times

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.850
 when you'll see a place you want to be career wise we're not quite

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.350
 there yet you don't have that skill you don't have that experience you

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.850
 have the reputation but I don't think you can do much affirmative

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.350
 to make that happen I think it's just a matter of being alert to the

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.850
 fact that I need to be here but I'm here I need to figure out how

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.350
 to get for them on the beach and and keep that in mind en route and

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.850
 remember that it's it's never things okay I don't have to change do

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.350
 okay you always want to be thinking how can they do this better how

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.850
 could he do this more can I be more useful go after
