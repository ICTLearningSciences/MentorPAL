00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.300
I've been in computer science since nineteen seventy one in computer science

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.750
 has changed tremendously in that when I took my first course

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.200
 in so I structure on how to use for training for program one of Seymour

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.650
 craze for supercomputers the CDC sixty five hundred and that was

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.100
 wonderful and exciting work it turned out it was really good at it

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.550
 sold my professor who talk to me one day about what I had in mind for

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.000
 profession and I told him I really would like to state in computers

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.450
 and he told me all day and this is remember nineteen seventy one you

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.900
 you won't be able to make any money in computers because soon there

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.350
 will only be two or three big computers in this nation state probably

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.800
 at big universities like one of cal tech and wanted in my tea in

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.250
 one of the university of Illinois and everybody would use those computers

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.700
 and their old feel very few imputed programmers doing all the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.150
 program so I did not pursue it because I didn't think it was a growing

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.600
 field from what he told me and I think he was giving me good honest

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.050
 advice but it was certainly wrong because of course now everybody

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.500
 in his own goal has a computer not only on his desk but sometimes

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.950
 on his wrist watch and half the people playing with it do a little

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.400
 programming one kind or another so that's why change it's just huge

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.850
 compared to what we thought it would be in nineteen seventy one
