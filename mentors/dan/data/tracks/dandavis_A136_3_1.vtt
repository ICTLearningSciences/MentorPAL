00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.470
As a junior enlisted person, while most people in the marine corps and

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.090
 the navy lived in open bay barracks, that is you live in one fairly

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.710
 large room with anywhere from twenty to fifty bunks in it. Frequently

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.330
 the bunks were double deckers, that is there was somebody be the

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.950
 upper bunk and somebody lower bunk sometimes they were single level.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.560
 Then when you make a NCO level, used to be with then you'd get and

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.180
 one or two man room, and then as you got to be a very senior enlisted

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.800
 you would get a reasonable suite to live in. Although senior listed

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.420
 frequently got married and we're living in married quarters or off

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.040
 camp. So they were all pretty decent. Now of course when you're a combat

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.660
 zone you might be on the field some living in tents, depending

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.280
 on if you're one of the services that does that sort thing. Like the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.900
 air force doesn't do that very much, and the navy doesn't do that

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.520
 very much, but there were navy linguists with me and Kontin, up in the

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.140
 DMZ. where we were living in bunkers. There was a navy corpsman that

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.750
 was up there with this I stepped on this great big engineering spike

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.370
 that went all the way through my foot, stuck out the top and there

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.990
 was a navy corpsman right there to give me a booster shot of tetanus,

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.610
 and and laughed with me about a stupid thing that was to step

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.230
 on that spike. But living quarters typically for cryptologist was very

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.850
 good
