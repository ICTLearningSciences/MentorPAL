If you're considering joining the navy I think you need to think very

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.850
 carefully about it. Remember it's not something you can decide to do

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.850
 today and quit doing it tomorrow, it does involve you signing up for

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.850
 a period of time but I've known people who joined the navy for a million

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 different reasons and a lot of them found out that the navy did

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.850
 not satisfy the need they thought it was going to satisfy, but it

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.850
 did bring about some change in them that was a good positive change

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.850
 that they were anticipating. But I think the main thing is is when

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.850
 you go sign on the dotted line with the recruiter knowing that you've

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 signed on the dotted line to serve that many years and they're not

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.850
 gonna wanna let you go.
