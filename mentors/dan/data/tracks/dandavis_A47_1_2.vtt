00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.230
New members of the military first have to get used to the fact that they

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.620
 are no longer the center of the universe, and that what they owe

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.000
 is is a debt of allegiance to their immediate buddies in their unit

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.390
 and that their buddies will take care of them but they have to take

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.770
 care of their buddies, and that's a different mindset. I think people

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.160
 who've gone through team athletics have that mindset and can pick

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.540
 it up very rapidly, but a lot of people who are new to the military

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.930
 don't get that you have to learn that you're not as important as everybody

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.310
 else is together you have to learn that kind of cohesiveness

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.700
 and camaraderie that keeps going and part of that is the group needs

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.080
 to be responsive to leadership, and once you've learned that cohesive

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.470
 group and responsive to leadership then your life is golden in the

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.850
 military.
