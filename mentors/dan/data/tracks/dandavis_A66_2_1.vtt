00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.540
That that's gonna be a disappointing one for I'm one of those guys who

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.230
 loves the work I do so much I do it at home. My hobbies are writing

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.930
 code, so tonight when I go home I'll be working on some code I'm working

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.620
 on for a paper and write a little high school classmate who used

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.310
 to be a high school counselor and yeah she and I are writing a paper

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.000
 together and we're doing polls for people respond to and I'll be

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.700
 home writing code trying to figure out how to analyze the data we get

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.390
 back from that poll because that's what I love to do and strangely

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.080
 enough when I was in the military, I worked with cryptologic personnel.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.770
 Do you know what they did on their off time?They worked crossword

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.470
 puzzles. They were all inveterate crossword puzzle solvers and you

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.160
 know it's just you know it's it's a blessing for the good lord when

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.850
 you can do the work that you really love.
