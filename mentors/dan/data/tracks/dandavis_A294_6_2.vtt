00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.320
you might want to know who's makes the most money and stem which it feels

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.790
 going to pay me the best I would encourage you not to think that

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.260
 way because is a matter of fact virtually everyone in this country

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.730
 anyway has enough money to buy food we have enough money for shelter

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.200
 and clothing in transportation and healthcare it's hard to find somebody

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.670
 who's so impoverished they can't afford these things so the money

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.140
 money you make is not this crude issues you might think there's

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.610
 very good research showing that after a just a subsistence level happiness

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.090
 does not grow up with income and some of the most miserable people

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.560
 are the people who've made the most so money is not a very good

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.030
 way to pick a career but within the still feel they're all very new

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.500
 high paying jobs that's like saying who's the richest person America

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.970
 as compared with the second richest person in America will fully

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.440
 both got so much money I can't spend you know they just be impossible

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.910
 for them to spend all the money they've got so what division make

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.380
 who's got a little more than the other so don't get fixated on who who

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.850
 makes the most money and still
