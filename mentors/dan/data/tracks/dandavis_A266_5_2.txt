00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.310
order things I would caution you about your entire life is not believing

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.770
 what entertainment tries to tell you about a career or life as you

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.230
 go through life you'll see movies all the time and you'll hear people

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.680
 say oh that movie is just like it was and mostly that's absolutely

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.140
 wrong movies accentuate what's interesting and they would play leave

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.600
 off the parts that are boring and dull and and that gives you a

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.060
 false impression of what life was like so I think movies are not correct

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.520
 in the way they portray life but I think video games particularly

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.970
 give you a false impression because a lot of the young kids I mean

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.430
 in high schools today wanna tell me they're going to join the military

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.890
 shoot somebody like a cannon to video games and I have to tell

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.350
 only one quarter of the people in the army one quarter are in combat

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.810
 arms that means three quarters done anything to do with weapons one

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.270
 quarter in combat arms to guys in combat arms only half of them have

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.730
 anything directly to do with the weapon if you're an armored battalion

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.180
 you're as likely to be a tank truck driver driving fuel around

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.640
 as you are to be a tank driver driving a taker so that means there is

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.100
 only one eighth of the chains and then you talk about the number of

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.560
 those guys who ever see combat you talk about the route guys who were

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.020
 in combat will ever get a chance to fire the weapon and the guys

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.470
 if you fire the weapon most the time they're just shooting at an area

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.930
 that I don't have any idea who's out so the idea go around shooting

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.390
 individual people looks good in the movies in the video games the

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.850
 way life is sorry
