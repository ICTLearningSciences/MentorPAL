00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.960
I would have to say my typical day at my civilian job which is high performance

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.060
 computing research in the academia %HESITATION has largely

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.170
 evolved over the years but not too much %HESITATION generally have

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.270
 technical duties like and technical duties reviewing %HESITATION code

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.380
 on one project I have the GPL and I had a technical duties involving

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.480
 the %HESITATION purchase and installation of a large coprocessor

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.590
 in early a high performance computer and Martin Marietta of but a lot

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.690
 of the day gets taken up with meetings %HESITATION probably a quarter

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.800
 the date probably a quarter the day goes to sending a replying to

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.900
 emails and other communications %HESITATION probably a quarter of

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.010
 the day goes to working on technical issues and and organization and

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.110
 then perhaps maybe a quarter the day goes to writing and their that's

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.220
 something that %HESITATION has increased over my career now is the

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.320
 senior person I probably spend half to three quarters of my day doing

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.430
 writing of one kind or another writing reports writing valuations

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.530
 writing proposals %HESITATION writing visionary papers %HESITATION

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.640
 trying to get something going %HESITATION so one of things I think

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.740
 I'll tell you right now if you can the do anything in academia learn

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.850
 how to write and learn how to write.
