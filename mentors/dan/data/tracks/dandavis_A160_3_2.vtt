00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.040
when I was in the reserves what we call the ready reserve I here's what

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.240
 we did and I think it's very comparable to that every month we did

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.430
 the weekend drill that means you bet Saturday morning early and we

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.620
 work till about five o'clock Saturday evening Sunday morning early to

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.820
 about five o'clock for those two full days of work we got paid for

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.010
 day's pay and because that's what it if you look at the amount of leave

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:37.200
 people get on their active duty and a lot of time off they get

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.400
 blah blah they work about four hours a day every day of the year and

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.590
 so let's that's what they paid to get four days pay for two days and

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.790
 then once a year you got a two week actor Tracy someplace so does

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.980
 a really good actor trees I got Naples I got three tours in Japan and

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.170
 in London England once you know is just all kinds of fun stuff but

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.370
 then you went and you just went with equally active duty people and

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.560
 did their job learned what they were doing and just trying to figure

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.750
 out if I get called up how my gonna handle so that's what you did

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.950
 you did your work you did training and the good thing about cryptologists

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.140
 are if you got a radio and you got a linguist you can be a cryptologist

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.330
 anywhere now we did some actual cryptologic stuff right there

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.530
 in our home reserve unit the benefits you get pretty good pay you

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.720
 know I got to law school living off of the those four days pay that

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.910
 I got from the reserves bought food for me and my wife and my brand

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.110
 new baby daughter that was good and as you get senior right the pay

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.300
 is pretty decent then when you retire they add up how many days of

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.500
 reserve duty you got credit for doing your weekends how much you've

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.690
 got new year two weeks of active duty and then how much active duty

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.880
 you did like I get four years will bring cars they told all add up

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.080
 that gives you the percentage of your pay and then because I'm a retired

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.270
 commander I get retired commanders pay times this percentage so

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.460
 I get about in my case about assertive order it right retired get plus

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.660
 medical benefits plus some other benefits like I can fly space available

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.850
 around the world one military aircraft
