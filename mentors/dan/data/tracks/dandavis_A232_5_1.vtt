I think it's always useful if you're considering a career to get into

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.140
 a career where your interest in what's going on if you doing what you

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.280
 really love to do shake it ever have a day of work in your life you

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.420
 just doing it because it is so interesting I would have to say but

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.560
 I've been in cryptology and computer research for virtually my entire

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.710
 life and all it was wonderful and I won the lottery when I was eighteen

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.850
 years old and had more money than I could ever spell I I don't

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.990
 think I would have changed my life a bit I've enjoyed what I've done

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.140
 I find it fascinating there is always a challenge in cryptology there's

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.280
 always a challenge of science and it being part of that and being

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.420
 part of insuring the civility about those challenges when you're

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.560
 debating them is so much fun I to me it was the most wonderful feel

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.710
 like could think up may not be true for everybody but it was for me
