00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.700
in both the military career choice area and in looking at academic or

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.550
 computer research I think the most important thing to do is to talk

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.400
 to as many people who actually do that you can and they ask them specific

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.250
 questions specific questions how long did you work every day what

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.100
 were the conditions how many people were in charge of you how many

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.950
 people are you in charge of how did your job changes you got more

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.800
 senior were there times when you didn't want to do this anymore do

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.650
 you still like doing it do most people the job stick with it or do water

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.500
 people tried and then move on tried and move on tried to move you

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.350
 know ask them specific things and if they give you fuzzy answers

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.200
 always okay try to pin them down you know if you had it to do over again

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.050
 would you do it again ill ask us for a specific thing now it's

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.900
 very hard to find people like that in everyday life you may not have

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.750
 access to any of them but you can go and do research in the library

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.600
 or online in and find a tells of these kinds of people and in some

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.450
 you might even be able to get a hold of and inter internet email exchange

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.300
 or into a if video call like Skype burden faced time one of those

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.150
 and that would give you a way to find out what it's like and try

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.000
 to talk to people whose loved it and people who hated because you get

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.850
 a different view from both of you need to hear both use
