00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.140
well it's kind of a difficult question to answer in a precision because

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.420
 that changes from time to time for instance during World War two they

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.710
 were very young people who list and they look very old people and

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.990
 watched because he needed people very badly but right now basically

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.280
 the time limits are on the order of you must be at least seventeen

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.560
 years old and then you still need parental permission until you're

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.850
 eighteen to enlist in the navy and then you can list up until about

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.140
 the age thirty and this varies from time to time and the services change

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.420
 it from time to time depending on the requirements and the services

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.710
 are different for instance the navy right now is thirty two years

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.990
 the marines are twenty nine years but the statutes say you can be

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.280
 in listed up to age for forty two if they need so that changes and

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.560
 their exemptions made but that's because of the rain seventeen Tim thirty

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.850
 it's kind of when they want you to enlist
