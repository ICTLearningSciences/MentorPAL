Well hard to think of a funny story in terms of a joke, but I'll tell

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.710
 you one that's a good joke on me. We were standing watch one night on

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.140
 the outside perimeter line around in Phu Bai, Vietnam and I was there

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.560
 was an army staff sergeant and another marine corps sergeant and

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.990
 the army staff sergeant regular ran the bunker and the other sergeant

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.420
 and I were just there helping out that night in the army staff sergeant

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.850
 dog started barking, so we thought maybe there was some Vietcong

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.280
 or North Vietnamese army people who had gotten through the wire

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.710
 and were out of the field where the dog was barking so we said well

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.140
 I guess we gotta go out and check so the only thing I had with me that

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.560
 night was my M1911 A-145 automatic pistol and the army sergeant had

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.990
 an M16 so we were about a hundred meters one direction from the bunker

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.420
 and I was a hundred meters in the other direction so here I am

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.850
 standing out in this field about knee high grass of while the sergeant

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.280
 who stayed in the bunker called one of the arms bunkers the shooting

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.710
 bunkers out on the perimeter line and told to fire a pop up flares,

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.140
 so there's a little rocket propelled flare that goes whoosh and

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.560
 then as a flare so you see can see and I'm standing out there in the

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.990
 grass waiting for this flare to go off hoping that I do the right

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.420
 thing if we went off all all of a sudden it occured to me that I had

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.850
 was this nineteen eleven was seven rounds in the magazine all I had

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.280
 was seven bullets from a handgun I suppose what happens with a far

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.710
 off that flare of a whole company of Vietnamese soldiers stand up from

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.140
 the middle of the grass and they've all got rocket propelled grenade

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.560
 launchers and I sat there and I sat there sat there and then it

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.990
 got tense quiet and finally the flare went off. I must have almost jumped

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.420
 about three feet straight in the air when that sucker went off

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.850
 so if there was a VC in the grass, I would not be able to see him because

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.280
 I was up way up in the air when that's didn't see anybody stood

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.710
 out there for another couple minutes to make sure it in here but

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.140
 he tried to get through the grass away from me we went back to the bunker

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.560
 later on that day we saw the dark bog barkinh at another dog somewhere

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.990
 down on the fence line and so we think that's what the dog

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.420
 was barking at the previous night so that's to me that was pretty funny

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.850
 when I come to think of it.
