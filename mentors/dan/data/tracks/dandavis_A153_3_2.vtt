My experience was the ethnic percentages in both the marine corps and

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 the navy are quite comparable to civilian life and the civilian population.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.850
 There may be a little plus up of some of the undere employed

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 an underrepresented minorities, simply because the military is since

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.850
 nineteen fifteen the way been pretty well known for getting some of

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.850
 the best opportunities for minorities working their way up, like anybody.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 I mean you get a lot of free training you get your education

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 covered when you're out, so it was good way for somebody with economic

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.850
 issues to get a leg up on life.
