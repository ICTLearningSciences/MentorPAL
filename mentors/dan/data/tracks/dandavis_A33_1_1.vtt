00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.450
On a typical day the hours you work in the military vary depending on

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.050
 the kind of duty you're serving. If you're serving overseas, especially

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.650
 in the combat zone, obviously in your in active combat you may be

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.250
 serving twenty four hours a day. But even in a combat zone doing technical

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.850
 work you're probably going to be working almost half of every

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.450
 day seven days a week. But then when you get back state side you're

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.050
 given kind of easy duty, a lot of slack time, and you might only

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.650
 work part time during the day. And then there's a lot of leave that

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.250
 you can take so even in Vietnam, we were given an opportunity to take

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.850
 what they call 'basket leave' that is done charge leave of of the

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.450
 week every couple of months. You could take some time off and there

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.050
 were times when they would stand out to you where it would just have

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.650
 time. So it varies all over the place and that's of one of the benefits

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.250
 of one of the problems with the military is it isn't steady, sometimes

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.850
 it is working all day and sometimes it it's take it easy.
