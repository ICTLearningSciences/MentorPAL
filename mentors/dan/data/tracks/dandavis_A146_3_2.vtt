00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.520
The most difficult part of my training was physical training. PT, and

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.180
 exercise is not one of my fortes and I hated it, and I still hate it.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.850
 So that's the most difficult part of all of my military training and

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.520
 upkeep. But the one good thing about the military's it does make

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.180
 sure you don't get out of line very much with your weight and your fitness.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.850
 So even a day even though and no longer active in the military

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.520
 I get up every morning and walk a couple miles, kept my weight pretty

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.180
 much down, a little over, I probably should be two twenty I'm really

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.850
 about two thirty five. But you know that keep it down to, but

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.520
 that's that's difficult. Intellectually their training system is that,

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.180
 they trained you well they give you a lot of legs up to make sure

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.850
 you're doing alright. Training's good.
