00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.200
One of the best features the military is the ability to retire at an early

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.550
 age, if you're active duty you can retire after just twenty years

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.900
 of service occasionally eighteen and a half. The service really thinks

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.250
 it's to the other good the service to let you go then. And at

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.600
 that juncture usually get about half your base pay but none of your

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.950
 housing allowances, then you get medical benefits for the rest your

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.300
 life that is anytime you get to a military hospital will take care of

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.650
 you, if you get to the civilian doctor there's something called tricare,

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.000
 that pays kind of like insurance. So you can be taken care of.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.350
 If you're a reservist the retirement benefits don't start when you

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.700
 retire, they started age sixty. So you have to wait until age sixty

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.050
 before you can retire. And that's still a pretty good deal because

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.400
 at age sixty, then you get a fraction of what the active duty people

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.750
 get, depending on how much drilling you did and how often you went

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.100
 on active duty, you know the like. They have a formulated a calculator

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.450
 that comes up with some portion, but it's it's a nice little stipend

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.800
 that goes longer. So security from your school and work, that is

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.150
 makes it up. It's worthwhile retiring and at age sixty you get the

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.500
 tricare if you want it or if you close to a military base you can go

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.850
 there for medical care as well
