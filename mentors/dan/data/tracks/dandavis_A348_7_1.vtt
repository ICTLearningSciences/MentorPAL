linguistic training in the military is not difficult because of as you

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.730
 if you will military just put %HESITATION there's no question about

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.670
 whether you get up in the morning want to go to class now if you get

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.610
 in the morning you do go to class and most of all lessons or are self

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.560
 contained that is you're not doing a lot of extra work on the side

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.500
 if you go to class and if you don't go to class they report use you

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.440
 a and you get arrested %HESITATION then you're given a pretty straightforward

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.380
 training so it's pretty straight forward and and not to

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.320
 challenge well you have to take a test before you can get in the language

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.260
 school that we tell people who don't have any ability language

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.200
 now in my class we started out with age and we lost one fairly rapidly

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.140
 because we are Vietnamese is a total language and if you don't

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.090
 hear the tones %HESITATION then you can't do the language for example

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.030
 of the word not tough means a church the house of the church %HESITATION

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.970
 but not to a means the house of ill repute %HESITATION not to

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.910
 think you want to get mixed up %HESITATION so this young man could

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.850
 not hear the difference in those tones and he was excused
