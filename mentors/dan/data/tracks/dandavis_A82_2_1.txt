00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.060
I think the greatest whole work in the military is the camaraderie of

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.270
 the unit camaraderie that allows you to get through combat while she

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:16.480
 gets you personal loss, allows you to get through injury, allows you

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.690
 to get through incredible stress and survive that's you see some of

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.900
 that in civilian life. You see some more of it in some kinds of civilian

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.110
 life like police work or firefighting well you get that kind

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.320
 kind of camaraderie but I think it's really a hallmark of the military.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.530
 The other hallmarks of the military and in the American experience

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.740
 anyway as is the rotation system where you hardly ever any place

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.960
 longer than about two years. So things are always changing, you jobs

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.170
 changing. You work you're doing its changing, the kind of work you

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.380
 are doing is chaning. You're not just going to be a letter carrier for

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.590
 your entire years of life. My father in law did nothing but deliver

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.800
 the mail for the post office fourty years and he loved that. I think

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.010
 that I would not look I love the military where you'll be a linguist

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.220
 here you can go be a cryptanalyst there you go be a team leader

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.430
 here you can go be a unit leader there you can rise in rank you can

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.640
 go different places that kind of progression I enjoyed go back to it

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.850
 tomorrow if I had the opportunity.
