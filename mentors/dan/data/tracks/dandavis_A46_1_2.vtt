I think one of the most important things in your life is making a choice

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.850
 about where you want to go and then pursuing that. But I've seen

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.850
 so many people pursue the wrong goal in their life and wind up in something

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.850
 they were a very good at. In my case when I joined the marine

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 corps had no idea that I wanted to go in cryptology, but looking back

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.850
 on it, the marine corps knew better than I did about which way I

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.850
 was going. And now that I know what I know about myself I just hit

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.850
 the stand in awe of the fact that they somehow knew that about me better

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.850
 than I did and so I think there are times when you have to listen

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 to what other people are telling you about, 'you know you'd really

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.850
 fit very well in that area not here you've picked out for yourself'.
