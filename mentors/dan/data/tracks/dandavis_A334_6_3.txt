if you need to talk to somebody who's been in the navy the question of

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.850
 how you go about meeting them so you can talk to him is a good one

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.850
 I think the best way to do that would be to ask around your family and

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.850
 friends and say who you know who's been in the navy recently you

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 could talk to me about what it's like in the navy today and see if you

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.850
 can find out that way that'd be one good way to meet people in the

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.850
 navy a second way to meet people and maybe if you're interested in

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.850
 that would be for you to go talk to a recruiter and talk to them but

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.850
 remember they have a quota they have to get so many people Englishman

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 navy and they're trying to get you to join the navy so they have

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.850
 their own agenda going that maybe skew what they tell you a little

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.850
 so but they also may be able to tell you or by the way I know John Jones

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.850
 next to me he used to be in the navy or another guy in a bar I'll

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.850
 tell you where he lives he used me that if you go talk to him so

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 you might get an independent way of talking somebody in the navy that
