00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.850
virtually everyone in the military is an officer of one kind or another.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 After you go through your first three pay grades E-1 through three

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.850
 the next pay grade is either noncommissioned officer in the ground

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 forces or petty officer in the naval forces. Above that we have a warrant

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.850
 officers who are technical specialists who rate between a non

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.850
 commissioned officers and commissioned officers, and then you have

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 commissioned officers. I am a commissioned officer now but served for

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 eight years six in the marine corps and two in the navy as a non commissioned

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.850
 officer or petty officer
