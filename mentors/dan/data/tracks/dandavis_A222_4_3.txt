00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.090
the call of the military on your time is different in civilian life there

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.330
 are times for instance if you're in a combat zone where the call

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.560
 is all the time if you're in active combat you're on duty twenty four

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.800
 hours a day trying to keep yourself alive and achieve your mission

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.040
 and there are times when you're not in a combat situation where there's

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.280
 a tremendous amount of spare time and mostly that's granted to

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.520
 you to take time to do things interventions to you even in combat situations

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.750
 for instance while I was in Vietnam I was given to one week

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.990
 periods where they flew me anywhere in the Pacific Rim that I want

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.230
 to go to visit so I spent a week in Australia all on my own doing anything

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.470
 I want to do and we can Japan later on the same way but in general

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.710
 the military we give you weekends off in general they give you

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.950
 thirty days leave here where you can go where you want do whatever

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.180
 you want and they do what they call basket leave that is leave they

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.420
 just give you it's not charge against your leave they just tell you

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.660
 don't come to work for a couple of days so it kind of evens out so

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.900
 there is a lot of spare time from time to time but those who do ship

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.140
 or duty same deal once you're at sea you might spend twelve hours a

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.370
 day on your job and have very little time other than to sleep and keep

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.610
 yourself clean but when you're sure you might have a lot of spare

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.850
 time
