00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.390
in all the professional work I have done I have found that I'm most often

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.930
 really in touch with what I'm working on to the point where the

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.470
 rest of the world just disappears on and I mean what they call the state

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.000
 of flow I when I am doing one of two things the first is programming

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.540
 from the very first programming course I took in fortran all the

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.080
 way up to the programming I do day to day now which is more often

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.620
 working on websites and doing PHP Java script and HTML but when I am

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:37.160
 programming time stands still and the rest the world just disappears

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.700
 to some degree that's also true when I do technical writing like

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.230
 writing papers proposals are reports but most often it is when I'm doing

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.770
 programming which is several times a day I get a chance to do a

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.310
 little programming and I can feel the the world stop and wait for me

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.850
 to finish
