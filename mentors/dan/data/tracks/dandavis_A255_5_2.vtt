00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.280
you know it's funny if you ask me who my favorite memories in the military

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.710
 I could hardly think of one that is my favorite I had so many they

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.140
 just crowd in the one I could talk forever about things I did in

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.560
 the military in college I think I had a good time and enjoyed being

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.990
 in college I enjoyed the people enjoyed the sports never played I enjoyed

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.420
 the quiet lived I lived in boulder Colorado if you place to live

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.850
 that was where I spent the first four years of my marriage was small

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.280
 I was in college so I had good memories there but I guess the best

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.710
 memory I have about college was finding the excitement in doing

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.140
 computer program if you're a programmer you love it as much as I do

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.560
 once you get started on that somebody has to comments make you stop

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.990
 you need to go eat you need to go get some sleep you know you don't

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.420
 want to stop so I I think learning about computer programming is the

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.850
 most fun memory I have from college
