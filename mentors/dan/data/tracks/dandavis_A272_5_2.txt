00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.850
to me the thing that made the very core the navy different from civilian

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 life was the team orientation and I think that showed up in a number

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.850
 of different ways and one of the ways it showed up social I was

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 the executive officer of a reserve unit in Topeka Kansas when I lived

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.850
 in Colorado springs and the commanding officer lived in Denver so

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.850
 when we had weekend duty we would fly from Denver and Colorado springs

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 down to Topeka to do our weekend duty that we follow her own nickel

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 and we had to pay our own way down and we did that for several years

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.850
 and most of the rest the unit came from all over Kansas most of

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.850
 them did not live there in Topeka so we don't get in there about Frady

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.850
 about dinnertime and we all immediately start calling each other

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 because they put us up in the hope navy put us up in a hotel there for

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.850
 the weekend if we are coming from base they paid for that we call

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.850
 each other and find out who was there and we all get together we go

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.850
 to dinner there we go out to one of the clubs and we drink beer and

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.850
 listen to music all night as almost the entire unit even the guys who

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.850
 lived in Topeka would come join us and do that and then we come and

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.850
 we work hard all day Saturday then we do that again Saturday night

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.850
 we all get together go to dinner together go to clubs together so

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.850
 to me that indicates kind of the navy culture we were a team we ate

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.850
 together when we knew each other we know each other by name we knew

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.850
 each other's problems we knew how to help each other get through
