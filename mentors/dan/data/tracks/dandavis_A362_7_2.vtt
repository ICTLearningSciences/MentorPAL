00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.780
Mike civilian occupation the is in research administration in academia

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.720
 I also worked in %HESITATION industry doing the same sorts of things

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.650
 research in ministration and research and %HESITATION I'd work for

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.580
 awhile as an eternity %HESITATION I think all three of those jobs have

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.520
 the decent future %HESITATION none of them is particularly amenable

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.450
 to automation %HESITATION all of them %HESITATION have of wide vistas

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.380
 of of various into which you can go but let's stick with the technical

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.320
 work in academia %HESITATION I think the future there he is

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.250
 %HESITATION pretty wide open %HESITATION academics by large are wells

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.180
 situated if they're doing research in the field in academia that's

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.120
 really getting constraint is the tenure track three additional tenure

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.050
 track position tenure track positions are very expensive for the

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.980
 universities and so they're more more research professors and adjunct

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.920
 professors doing the teaching and fewer and fewer tenure track professors
