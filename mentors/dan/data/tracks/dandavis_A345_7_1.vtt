00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.000
people in the United States almost invariably speak English as their first

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.140
 language and frequently because we live on a continent where at

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.290
 least one border %HESITATION the other people speak English there too

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.440
 a most Americans are not particularly bilingual or trilingual as

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.590
 people are frequently in Europe %HESITATION so as you go around the

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:07.730
 world doing various duty there is a need for language to understand

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:08.880
 the language of the people with whom you working and your foes as well

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.030
 %HESITATION so there are three groups of people who %HESITATION do

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.170
 linguistic duty in the military to help out in the first or interpreters

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.320
 and interpreters are people who just help a local commanding

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.470
 officers in the face with the people of the local community so an interpreter

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:14.610
 %HESITATION might for instance run around with a marine corps

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.760
 captain and his company as they crossed the through %HESITATION

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.910
 territory where the people speak a different language and be able to

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.060
 translate for the captain when he needs to talk to natives when he

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.200
 needs to find out where the enemy is or what he needs to warn the people

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.350
 %HESITATION that they need to clear out of the area because there

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.500
 is going to be a major but so that's an interpreter then you have

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.640
 the interrogators and these are people who trained at a higher level

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.790
 so that they can actually conversation we engage captured enemy and

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:24.940
 other people might have intelligence and they also have on top of

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.090
 their linguistic training %HESITATION very sophisticated of psychological

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.230
 training so that they can trick the enemy and the divulging %HESITATION

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.380
 secrets and then the level of %HESITATION cryptologic linguist

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.530
 is even the higher still into the records even more extensive linguistic

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.670
 training because the linguist needs to not only be able to

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:31.820
 translate the material that has been collected and decrypted but he

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.970
 also helps to hope the cryptanalyst %HESITATION understand the way

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.110
 the language works and what kind of in coding and encryption might be

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.260
 used of a lot of the encryption these days of course is the mechanically

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.410
 and is not done %HESITATION in the piecemeal basis which would

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.560
 not involve the linguist as much %HESITATION but still small level

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.700
 codes require language to help out the cryptanalysts to break the codes
