00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.400
well the progression of the stem careers through the decades is pretty

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.940
 hard to stomach when you're just starting out to some degree of maybe

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.490
 a little daunting but let's let's I give you what I've experienced

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.030
 over the years when you start out in stem you're gonna probably start

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.580
 out relying a lot of the skills you learned in high school junior

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.120
 college bachelor level college master's degree or PhD where do you

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.670
 come into the process and a lot of those skills you use every day you

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.210
 know like a programming skill if you're doing programming or mathematical

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.760
 analysis of some kind and you do that a lot but you probably

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.300
 spend maybe a quarter of your day writings English one kind or another

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.850
 but very soon you're going to find maybe just after a few years

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.400
 you're spending half your day writing English and only and the other

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.940
 half doing code and by the time you get to be more and more senior

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.490
 you gonna spend more and more time writing so there is a secret there

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:09.030
 if you can advance in the stem fields you better get good at writing

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.580
 good concise believable compelling English people can read and they'll

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.120
 go along with what you're trying to get him to go along with

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.670
 good materials you're giving so that's how it progresses you start out

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.210
 doing the technical work than you do more and more reporting and

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.760
 management until the very end and then some of the guys I know spent

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.300
 eighty percent of their time writing English one way or the other are

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.850
 preparing lectures or something of that nature
