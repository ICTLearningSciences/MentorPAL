Marine corps boot camp was one of the most challenging things I've ever

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.380
 done in my life I'm not very athletic and later on in life I found

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.650
 out that hypothyroid which means I didn't develop a lot of upper body

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.920
 strength and muscle mass when I was growing up. So boot camp was

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.180
 a real challenge for me because you get a lot of P. T. you ran everywhere

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.450
 you're constantly being harassed by the drill instructors . You

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.720
 had a lot to learn, but I'm pretty smart so I learned pretty fast

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.980
 they try to put a lot of pressure on this but I was older than mostly

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.250
 kids in boot camp I was in my early twenties most of them are like

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.520
 eighteen or so so I handle that kind of screaming and yelling better

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.780
 than they did, didn't make a difference to me what that drill instructor

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.050
 called me, I kind of thought the profanity was kind of funny.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.320
 But boot camp is one part of the military that you're glad you did

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.580
 and you're glad it's behind you, and glad you don't have to do again.
