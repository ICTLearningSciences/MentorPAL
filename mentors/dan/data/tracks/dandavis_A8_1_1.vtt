00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.850
I think my favorite life would best be described as kind of a Norman Rockwell

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 existence. I had three brothers two older than I was and then

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.850
 one younger and we had if basic middle class household. Both my parents

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 were college educated although they were both the first people

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.850
 and their families who had been college educated, and the family was

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.850
 oriented toward education and knowledge and I remember spirited intellectual

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 discussions at the dinner table for my entire life. I wasn't

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 particularly athletic but I spent most my high school off time working

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.850
 at a drug store before I went off to college when I turned eighteen
