00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.630
some questions do not have the universal answer one question I feel like

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.410
 is very very personal is should I go into the military for a bit

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.180
 and then go and finish my college work or should I finished my college

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.960
 work and then go into the military pens depends on who you are and

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.740
 what you want to do with your life and those two things you have to

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.520
 consider very carefully if you are absolutely convinced you wanna

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.290
 be military don't have military career in you're never going to be anything

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.070
 other than in the military probably wrong for what they but

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.850
 let's say you're convinced then you should probably try to get into

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.630
 one of the academies are one of the ROTC programs because that's the

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.410
 way to go on the other hand if you're not so sure maybe a little college

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.180
 maybe not Megan list is before you go to college just take a shot

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.960
 at what military life's gonna teach as for me let me just tell you

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.740
 one example I should not have gone to college before when the notes

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.520
 I should work to couple years gone the military for a couple years

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.290
 and then gone back to college but I didn't do it so but I survived

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.070
 and you'll survive if you make a mistake you just got to keep at it

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.850
 and figure out where you're going everyday
