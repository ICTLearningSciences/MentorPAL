the interesting point is well what someone who might be interested military

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.420
 career might do well they're still in high school now some six

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.210
 hundred high schools in the United States have a navy junior reserve

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.990
 officer training corps programs where you can practice in learning

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.780
 some of military skills while you're still in high school that's not

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.490
 has an excellent reading list for people considering a career in

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.280
 the marine corps but doing as much reading as you can about the military's

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.060
 always a good leg up and it was certainly one of my favorite

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.850
 topics when I was in high
