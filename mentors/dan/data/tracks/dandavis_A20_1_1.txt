00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.920
The thing that most civilians don't realize that even in a combat zone

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.980
 most of the military personnel are not assigned to weapons duty but

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.050
 have other kinds of duties as a cryptologist. My day was broken up

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:21.120
 into eight hours on watch using my linguistic capabilities to further

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.180
 the effort, then on off duty time I had time to take care of my gear,

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.250
 eat, sleep, and do maintenance on the trench line in defensive positions

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.320
 around our particular area. On occasion, quite regularly actually

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.380
 we would get hit by mortars and rockets at which point even if

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.450
 you were on watch you went to the trench line in the special crew

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.520
 took over your watch duties, while you may have that trench line in

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.580
 case the attack was more than just rockets. When I was at CON TN and

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.650
 we had people in the wire, that is trying to get into our compound,

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.720
 one time but other than that it was pretty much just doing your technical

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.780
 job and taking care review defensive position and taking care

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.850
 of yourself
