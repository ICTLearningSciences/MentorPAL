you know it's been in this profession that is the profession of high performance

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.180
 computing for forty five years forty five years that's longer

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.350
 than people used to live but I've been doing a forty five years

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.520
 and every day I wake up I see a new skill that I need to learn one

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.680
 learned or have what and the skill I've learned the most recently probably

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.850
 would be I was working on a web based questionnaire to use and

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.020
 I'd never learned Java script and I needed some Java script to do

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.180
 some things on that questionnaire so I got a book a job description

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.350
 star learn Java script fits a lot of fun you can do all kinds of the

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.520
 Java script and the result of that so that's a skill even at my age

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.680
 and that seniority in my profession that I learned in it spot as the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.850
 first fortran code I wrote nineteen
