00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.380
I frequently see that the best year of my life with my year in Vietnam

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.920
 that's true to a large degree because of the tasks that we had over

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.450
 there in my ability to contribute to that task and being able to see

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.980
 or have reported to us the results of our activities there but the

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.520
 thing that impressed me the most over there as having a it made a difference

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.050
 in my life was my finding out that I was not frightened when

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.580
 under fire there are a lot of people over there who who really lost

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.120
 it when the first round started coming in be they rockets or mortars

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.650
 and yet I found that didn't bother me very much and I've spent my

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.180
 life without a great deal of bravery being exhibited and this seems

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.720
 like there's almost everything I do scare some people on the other

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.250
 I've got acrophobia every other kind of full you can think of but I

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.780
 didn't get rattled when the rounds came and and that gave me an assurance

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.320
 go about my life the rest of my life knowing well that's one

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.850
 thing that did morale
