I am the commander which is one of the senior officers below admiral.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.100
 The three stripes on my shoulder boards indicate that I am a commander

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.730
 which is called O-5, which is the pay grade and the star indicates

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.350
 that I am a line officer that means that I am expected to participate

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.970
 in actual combat kinds of duty as opposed to a staff officer like

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.600
 a chaplain or a doctor or a jag officer a lawyer, so I am I am unrestricted

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.230
 line which means I could command the ship if called upon to

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.850
 do so
