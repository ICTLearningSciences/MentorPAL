00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.070
I'm always the most concern when I feel like your group in which I am

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.290
 working has lost its way if somehow the team does not coalesce where

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.520
 the goal that's been given to us doesn't seem realistic or vital to

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.740
 anybody on the team and that goes for no matter how big the team is

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.960
 if I'm working with just two or three people and we're not making good

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.180
 progress because we don't know where we're going or if I'm talking

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.410
 about an entire nation it seems to have lost its way and not sure

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.630
 which way we want to go and begins to better Baker and argue with each

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.850
 other that keeps me up at night
