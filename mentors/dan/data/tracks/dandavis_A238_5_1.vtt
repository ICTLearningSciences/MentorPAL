00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.430
hello well I don't know fifteen twenty years ago I got really interested

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.020
 in the fact a lot of people were graduating with bachelor's degrees

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.600
 who didn't see very well educated to me they didn't have a good grasp

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.180
 of history there and no bass very well and it just seemed like

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.770
 a person with a college degree should be literate they should be familiar

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.350
 with the fine arts they should know basic skills like mathematics

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.930
 and science and they weren't so I started asking people what kind

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.520
 of questions do you think are important that are required all the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.100
 time so if you talk about specific courses to make a difference there

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.680
 are two groups in the first instance university will tell you we will

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.270
 not give you a degree unless you take these courses and so the choruses

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.850
 breezy but what about electives it also electives are different

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.430
 in the one electives I would recommend to everyone in the world

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.020
 and it's not universally dot is taking a course in statistics and I

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.600
 think it should be statistics probably in one of the boys here real

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.180
 science schools not in the math department because I'm not interested

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.770
 in the theoretical underpinnings of how you do correlation causation

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.350
 well I'm interested in is what does that say about the data and that's

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.930
 how the behavioral science people approach so even if you're a

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.520
 math quiz in very advanced in math I recommend to it just course in

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.100
 behavioral science school and in some feeling for the hell other people

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.680
 are made of the recommendations my sister in law so we all should

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.270
 take a course in genetics set has a big influence on our life anything
