00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.320
digitize the shin of the world is seems to be almost a given these days

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.780
 and we're going from digital into quantum computing so where we have

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.250
 a step to go yet there we can see right now the first quantum computers

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.720
 have actually been delivered so being part of the digital age

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.180
 has been exciting to me been doing it a long time I'm still excited

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.650
 about it I think it is a good way to do things it gives you an opportunity

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.120
 to project yourself in ways you couldn't otherwise I had fun

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.580
 putting together my movies page on my website where anybody who wants

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.050
 to can go to my website finally can the movies I like and wildlife

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.520
 Uelmen what my favorite scenes in the movies are those fun trying

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.980
 to say if I were here talking to you you know when one to talk about

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.450
 the movies I like you can see Atari else I've done that so I haven't

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.920
 done a lot of video like this before but I this is another good way

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.380
 for me to be able to express what I've learned in a way that might

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.850
 be useful to you
