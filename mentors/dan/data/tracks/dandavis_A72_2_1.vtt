00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.410
You know discussing nine eleven with people is an interesting phenomena.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.970
 It's one of those things you have to know somebody pretty well to

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.540
 di in deep to your emotions. But let me just say this about my feelings

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:23.100
 of nine eleven. I was in Hawaii. I was one of the directors at

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.660
 the now a high performance computing center for the University of Hawai

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.230
 and my daughter called me and said Dad go to the TV there's a terrible

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.790
 thing happening in New York. So I got to the TV before the second

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.350
 tower was struck, and I watched all of that. I'd have to say the

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.910
 major impact on me was one of stirring of aggression. I like the old

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.470
 firehouse horse when he hears the alarm bell go off he charges to

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.040
 get ready to take the horse drawn fire engine to the fire site. I just

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.600
 wanted to go someplace and do something and wanted to be part of

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.160
 it. So my my first impression was one of of anger. How can anybody

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.730
 do that to us? And the second one was let's go get em. But late again

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:24.290
 and I think I have to know you like better than I know you do go much

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.850
 deeper than that about what I felt on that day.
