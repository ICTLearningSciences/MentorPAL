00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.370
when I go to high school and talk to students in high school about careers

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.890
 of one kind or another one of the things that comes up frequently

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.410
 from the students who are doing poorly is I don't have to get good

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.930
 grades I'm gonna go in the military they're gonna give me a lifelong

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.450
 shoot people and I'm really athletic so I can do that real well the

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.970
 fact of the matter is in this country the military will not let you

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.490
 in list if you're in the bottom fifteen percent of intellect they

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.010
 will give you a test that's basically an IQ test if your IQ is below

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.530
 IQ eighty five fifteen percent of the population have accused Khloe

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.050
 five they basically will not let you must and of course somebody always

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.570
 says well I knew a guy once in back and we're we're Tuesday but

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.090
 that's the rule today and it's pretty Stricklin fours now if you're

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.610
 a little above that like it eighty five die Cuba ninety five you can

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.130
 list only if you did very very well in high school and had excellent

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.650
 grades in high school that show that even though you're a very smart

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.170
 you're very disciplined and you worked hard they will but if you

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.690
 didn't do very well in high school and your scores her in that low

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.210
 area that is eighty five to ninety five you're still below average

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.730
 they're not supposed to let you list again and receptions you know I

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.250
 can't tell you for sure but that's the rule if your school above average

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.770
 in intelligence bad record in high school may not keep you from

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.290
 being able to enlist as long as you fetish if you didn't finish it

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.810
 all then there always is that question what was wrong was a lack of

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.330
 discipline which lack of effort they don't want people were gonna put

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.850
 in the effort and I'm just not in the military he
