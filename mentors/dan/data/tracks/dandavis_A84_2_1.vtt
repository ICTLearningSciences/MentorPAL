There are a lot of people in cryptology who have been great contributors

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.610
 to the field well you think of the Freidman, Yardley, and Alan Turing.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.990
 You know Joe were ushered just wonderful wonderful people they

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.370
 all had could have different personalities but the one mark that I

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.750
 think above all else struck with them was they're all tremendously smart

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.140
 when we're in Vietnam we were very proud of the fact that the intelligence

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.520
 tells the marine corps gave you to get into the service

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.900
 the score you got on that test acquired school would be in cryptology

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.280
 was higher free listing people then the test given OCS in McAllen

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.660
 off well you can be a very good officer and not be really terrifically

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.040
 Intel I mean you have to be significant above average but you don't

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.420
 have to be really a genius whereas to be a good cryptologist do you

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.800
 know the one smart did so I I think that's kind of one thing that

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.180
 set the cryptologist apart from when everybody else so I think the

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.560
 most you come into the service what effect could intellectual ability

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.950
 your chances of succeeding cryptology are fairly low beyond that I

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.330
 think it is a lot of enthusiasm has to do with it along that line you

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.710
 know do you get in the field say this really exciting IBM looking

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.090
 forward working on this are you get in the field like a I mean there

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.470
 was anyway I wanted to get a gun and shoot people then you're not

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.850
 you know that's somebody who I don't think you can get
