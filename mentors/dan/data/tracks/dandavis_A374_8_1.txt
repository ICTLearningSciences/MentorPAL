00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.900
the military is broken into levels of command leadership and %HESITATION

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.960
 to some degree privilege and those go all the way through all the

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.010
 range so they're all kinds of officers for instance when you were first

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.060
 to list the first three pay grades are the for instance in the

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.110
 army of private private first class sorts of things %HESITATION in the

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.170
 ring for you should start out as a private in your private first

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.220
 class and lance corporal in the navy you started out as a seaman recruit

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.270
 the seaman apprentice seamen but beyond that and your petty officer

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.320
 in the navy or the non commissioned officer in the army so your

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.380
 %HESITATION petty officer third class chief petty officer in the army

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.430
 you might be a corporal or sergeant in the or a sergeant major finally

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.480
 when you get done then there's a group in between the non commissioned

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.530
 officers in the commission officers call warrant officers and

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.590
 they typically our technical experts who've gotten there weren't

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.640
 to be an officer so they can do their technical work that requires a

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.690
 high level of skill in some responsibility but not as much as commission

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.740
 officer %HESITATION in during the Vietnam War for instance of

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.800
 people who were trained as helicopter pilots usually remain warrant

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.850
 officers %HESITATION rather than commission officers who flew the larger

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.900
 craft so that's another group and then the group do you usually

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.960
 think of as officers like if you talk about officers you generally

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.010
 mean commissioned officers and their number ways to become a commissioned

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.060
 officer the most common we know no one is to go to one of the

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.110
 military academies about a quarter of the officers get their commission

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.170
 that way very very difficult very competitive get into that in the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.220
 %HESITATION not usually available to see everybody but if you're

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.270
 really the smartest kid in your high school and the athletic champion

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.320
 your high school you might give it a shot and see if you can do it

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.380
 %HESITATION then there are other all through programs like the ROTC

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.430
 program that's available at most large universities %HESITATION where

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.480
 the military will pay you to go to a civilian school in the in trade

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.530
 for which you do %HESITATION drill one zero a week and take a one

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.590
 courses semester in military subjects and they that's pretty good

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.640
 way to get through school you can go to a pretty expensive school in

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.690
 the government will pay for it that gives you a commission as well

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.740
 %HESITATION then the next way is what's called officer candidate school

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.800
 if you've gone to college already and you have a technical degree

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.850
 or degrees it's useful for the military %HESITATION they can take

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.900
 you in as an enlisted man basically but since you lost your candidate

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.960
 school where you're treated as an officer and you go through and if

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.010
 you graduate you become an officer and then you can go on into the

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.060
 ranks as a commissioned officer %HESITATION the last weight is if you're

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.110
 really top notch enlisted person and you've got the degree on

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.170
 your own usually an advanced degree then you have a shot at a direct

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.220
 commission you can just ask the navy or the army or the airforce the

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.270
 marine corps should not be an officer and they should do the selection

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.320
 board if you're picked because you're not only smart but you've

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.380
 got a degree and you've shown command characteristics in the can commission

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.430
 %HESITATION destined to happen and that's another good way

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.480
 %HESITATION to get a commission but remember that a lot of it mostly

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.530
 people have very high level grease when I was in cryptology there are

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.590
 more chief petty officers with PhD said there were commissioned officers

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.640
 with PhD a lot more so there a lot of very educated %HESITATION

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.690
 chiefs for one reason or another didn't want to be or could be a

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.740
 monster one chief I knew had a physical problem that didn't washing

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.800
 out of being in the navy but would allow him to accept a commission

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.850
 so there are a lot of different ways to get it to be in office
