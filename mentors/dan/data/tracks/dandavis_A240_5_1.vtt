00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.900
you know it took a lot of courses in my time in school and I spent a lot

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.950
 of time on in looking back on it at least from this position that's

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.000
 been a long time but I can't remember a single course that and feel

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.050
 like I got some benefit from some kind of idea what was going on

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.100
 and sometimes the insights worth one moves once that the person intended

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.150
 you to get for instance I took a course in writing when I was a

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.200
 freshman at the university of Colorado that was taught by the teacher

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.250
 who had a number of issues that they were fighting one was a sense

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.300
 of gender kind of disestablished mature so they I I don't even know

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.350
 how to describe it but clearly they had some gender issues that were

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.400
 working here in the end this person seem like they were a frustrated

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.450
 critic in looking at the writing we do and they were trying to teach

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.500
 is writing that was literary writing fiction right you know how

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.550
 do you describe the golden sun on the shifting sands not the kind of

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.600
 writing I do so it didn't do me any good but I did get a lot of course

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.650
 because I found out what's it like to work with a person like that

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.700
 and how do you get by did how do you not start fights with somebody

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.750
 like that how do you try to honor the skills they do have in learn

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.800
 from them even if it's a negative learn from them how not to teach

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.850
 a class now not true late yeah your students later on in life
