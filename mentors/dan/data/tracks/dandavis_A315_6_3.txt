00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.920
I entered college right out of high school because they came from a family

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.990
 where everyone in my family had a college degree or was working

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.060
 on one so my brothers who are still working on their degrees so was

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.140
 just kind of expected that I would looking back on it that was the

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.210
 wrong reason for me to go why should have gone and the result Hollywood

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.280
 about the same is because the degree is necessary kind of certified

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.350
 that you have none of the intellectual capability to college level

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.420
 work but you have the discipline of the organization to do it you

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.490
 can understand what requirements are you can understand how you have

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.560
 to get through your requirements to use only because when you get

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.640
 into the military and in the civilian life people want to know if there's

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.710
 a job that needs to be done is this guy smart enough to do it

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.780
 does he have the skills to do it dizzy have the discipline to make sure

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.850
 it gets done
