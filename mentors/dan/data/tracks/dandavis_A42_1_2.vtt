00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.940
Cryptology both in the civilian realm and in the military realm is filled

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.030
 with pressure. There is pressure to get the intelligence quickly,

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.120
 correctly, and to forward it on. There's the knowledge that you may

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.210
 have insights which is so vital to the nation that any failure on

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.300
 your part could have drastic consequences. As is so often true in life,

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.400
 that's also one of the pluses to doing this kind of work is knowing

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.490
 you're doing something worthwhile. But knowing that you have to

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.580
 do it right or someone will literally die can be a pressure that can

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.670
 get to you over a period time, and I've seen people he rocked emotionally

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.760
 because they've rendered such pressure so often for so long a

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.850
 time
