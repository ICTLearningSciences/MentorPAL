00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.800
I have the version do %HESITATION picking out a favorite of anything %HESITATION

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.760
 so let me give you a little better background well one of

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.710
 the things that's very common in the military is %HESITATION telling

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.670
 stories to each other and sometimes they involve telling a jokes that

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.620
 some comedian is come up with one kind or another but more often

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.580
 than not they are a humorous look at some activity in which everybody's

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.530
 participate %HESITATION so you get very good at being a storyteller

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.490
 in the military %HESITATION and you're a lot of jokes and they're

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.440
 sometimes when you have a sitting around to a club with everybody

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.400
 chipping in to buy the the picture you'll have kind of a little contest

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.350
 and everybody will say okay we're gonna tell a marine joke everybody

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.300
 in the table telemarketing joke and the first guy who can't come

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.260
 up with a new brain joke as to buy the next picture is able to come

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.210
 up with something in her is of course they're all variants on pick

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.170
 your favorite ethnic group Joe and just substitute the marine in the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.120
 in this case %HESITATION rather than other ethnic groups that you've

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.080
 had a joke about so you get this kind of nonsense is all in good

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.030
 humor and and good fun but my favorite kinds of jokes have always been

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.990
 the short sequence like prostate Achaeans and my favorite along

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.940
 that line probably because I'm a researcher is the old joke that if

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.900
 you steal ideas from one man that's called plagiarism but if you steal

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.850
 ideas from a whole group of people that's cold research
