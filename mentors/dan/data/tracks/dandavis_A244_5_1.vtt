00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.930
virtually every stem field you want to continue to develop your skills

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.000
 in two principal ways the first is formal education you know if if

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.080
 you're not working on your next agree your love if you've got a terminal

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.160
 degree like a peach tea then your spirit your MBA or masters in

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.230
 counseling just keep going with education I regret every hour I did

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.310
 not spend in the classroom that I could how many hours did I spend

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.390
 watching stupid TV you're watching a baseball or football game that

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.470
 I can remember now instead of doing something or have been more productive

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.540
 so that's one second wave is technical professionalism demands

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.620
 that you continue to read your journals from your technical associations

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.700
 and that you attend conferences and go here the papers present

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.770
 so that takes up a lot of time but that's the way you've got to keep

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.850
 it up if you're gonna do stem work
