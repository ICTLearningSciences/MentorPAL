00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.780
I think it's important that everyone have an ability and opportunity to

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.720
 participate in any kind of work in one displayed and I am very unhappy

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.650
 when I hear about anybody who feels like they have been given a

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.580
 fair chance but it is my belief from what I've been able to observe

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.520
 that almost every place I've been there have been some representatives

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.450
 of virtually every ethnic group every gender every for you sexual

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.380
 orientation preference not available to people if they wanted to take

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.320
 it but I would be misleading you if I didn't say there seems to

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.250
 be some ethnic groups who seem to excel in this kind of work and who

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.180
 you see more often than other areas and it's frequently in computers

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.120
 it's amazing how many of the people I see at a conference if you just

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.050
 look around are of Asian or a sub continent Indian descent because

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.980
 those two ethnic groups seem to produce very good computer scientist

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.920
 but you see somebody from every conceivable group so you know that

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.850
 it's available to people who want to pursue it
