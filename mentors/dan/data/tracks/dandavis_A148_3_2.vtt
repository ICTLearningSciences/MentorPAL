00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.590
I believe the work culture marine corps and navy is different from civilian

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.320
 life in that it focuses on team effort more than anything else

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.060
 I would I would describe that work effort is much more like a team

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.800
 sport like baseball or football where there is a great deal of coordination

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.530
 a great deal of reliance on each other a great deal of doing

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.270
 what you need to be doing so you won't let the team down. I am kind

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.010
 of the webmaster and the communications guy for my high school alumni

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.740
 class, and when I put out a request "please let me know what color

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.480
 the eyes of your grandchildren" or anything like that, the people

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.220
 I hear back from the first are my military veterans, because one of

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.960
 the things you learn in the military is 'we're all in this together,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.690
 everybody's got a job to do, and one of my jobs is to make sure that

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.430
 I don't make anybody else's job harder' so if somebody asked me clean

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.170
 up your bunk, clean up your bunk because otherwise they can do for

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.900
 you. If somebody asked me what color eyes do your grandchildren have,

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.640
 I will I respond right away so that they don't have to come running

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.380
 down and ask me again. And that's one thing you learn in the military

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.110
 and that's part of the work culture that I like the most, and

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.850
 I think it's more the most effective things in the military
