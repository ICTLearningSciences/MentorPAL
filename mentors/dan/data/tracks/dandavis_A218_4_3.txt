many people ask me if there is a trick I've learned over the years on

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.520
 getting the job done and getting organized do that job and my best advice

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.350
 to people who ask that question is for goodness sakes do not do

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.180
 it the way I do it I am about the world's worst a culture of specific

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.020
 tasks so I am the wrong guy has to figure out how to do a good job

 and get things done I think that thing you need to do that I can

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.680
 advise you on is you need to be very insightful about your own limitations

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.520
 and don't keep beating your head against the wall if you're no

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.350
 good it's something don't try to make yourself good at it find a way

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.180
 that you can do what you need to do without having that skill because

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.020
 a lot of people spend their whole life trying to acquire a skill

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.850
