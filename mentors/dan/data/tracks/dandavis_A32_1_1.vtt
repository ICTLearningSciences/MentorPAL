00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.580
because I enlisted in the marine corps fifty years ago now it's been,

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.320
 the pay scales back then were much lower. So you had it basically enough

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.050
 just to take care of a clothing maybe save up enough to go home

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.780
 for Christmas on a plane or something. But all everything else too

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.520
 provided by the marine corps, that is they gave you food every day they

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.250
 give you a place to live you give your clothes to wear, so you didn't

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.980
 need much money. Then you know you got more and more senior you

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.720
 got better pay. You certainly did not make his mouth when you enlisted

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.450
 to support a family but that's changed now. People who list today

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.180
 can support a family very early on in their careers. They used to

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.920
 say in the marine corps of if the marine corps wanted you to have a

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.650
 spouse they would have issued you want in your seabag. And they didn't

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.380
 do that. But now the progression up to the senior ranks of the either

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.120
 enlisted or the commission officer ranks, very good pay all the

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.850
 way up in good allowances for housing and the like.
