00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.520
I would say you almost without question anyone with the intellectual capacity

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.180
 to enlist in the United States military today he is smart enough

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.850
 to get some level of collegiate training maybe just at the associate

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.520
 level but I think I can say that almost without exception so if

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.180
 you're considering a military career then presumably you know your

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.850
 at the level that you can get to high school get a high school diploma

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.520
 done well enough that you can give the military then you can go

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.180
 right to associate and you probably can go all the way to a bachelors

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.850
 too much trouble you're gonna have to work a little harder you have

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.520
 to think a little more you can have to stretch yourself some but you

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.180
 can do that so the whole concept of if I'm not smart enough to go

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.850
 to college than whites if you literally you know let's just take it

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.520
 from the abstract if you would literally are not smart enough to do

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.180
 collegiate level work then you're probably not smart enough to be in

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.850
 the military what do you do then are there a lot of very satisfying

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.520
 jobs that you can do with the intellectual capability you've been

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.180
 given but that just the fact you even participating in this program

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.850
 indicates to me that that's a question you should be asking
