many people have a different take on how college differs from high school

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.940
 but by and large the thing I've served both in my own experience

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.490
 and the experience of my daughters is they went through that transition

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.030
 is high school generally allows you get by just by learning things

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.580
 and giving them back to the instructor kind of rote recitation of

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.120
 what you've already been taught writes colleges much more likely to

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.670
 get somebody's saying to you stop you have to think about this by

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.210
 yourself and you have to give me some original fought about how it all

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.760
 fits together and how it can be used so high school he is challenging

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.300
 to some degree but colleges where you really need to start thinking

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.850
 through programs and policies
