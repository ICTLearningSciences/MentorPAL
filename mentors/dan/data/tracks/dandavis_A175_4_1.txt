00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.030
there are things that keep me going the day to day and one of them is

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.210
 knowing that the people with whom I am working are working on the single

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.400
 I am and that I enjoy them and enjoy working on their work with

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.580
 him and there are times when you think well I just can't do it one

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.760
 more day it's too hard they're asking me to do things I'm not able to

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.940
 do I think yeah but everybody else on the team is trying to accomplish

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.120
 this goal and if I don't do my job they will be able to get to

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.300
 their their goal so that gets me going and when you're really down in

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.490
 the dumps you can look back and think of all people who sacrificed

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.670
 in the past keep you motivated in to keep you on task doing what you're

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.850
 supposed to be doing
