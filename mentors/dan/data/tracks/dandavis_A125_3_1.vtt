There's a series of questions about favorites that always kind of puzzle

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.740
 me. And the one the puzzles me the most is what is your favorite

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.180
 color. I don't have a favorite color, I can't imagine you would have

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.630
 a favorite color. I like combinations of colors I like all colors.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.070
 Some colors look better sometimes than other colors. So favorite color

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.520
 doesn't makes sense to me, I guess that's a gene I got that I'm missing

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.960
 the ability to have a favorite color because most people will

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.410
 come up with something, and I just I don't know what to tell you about

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.850
 favorite colors
