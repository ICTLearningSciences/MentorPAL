00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.100
if you are a pretty consistent thread throughout all of the work I've

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.350
 done both in the navy in civilian life is trying to find a better use

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.600
 for high performance computing infers simulation especially as we

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.850
 run out of money in the government to get tasks done in them or the

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.100
 most expensive parts of any activity at government included on personnel

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.350
 expenses so if I can replace a person with a computer I'm in good

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.600
 shape right now the problem I'm trying to solve is we need more senior

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.850
 people who are able to do more mentor for younger people coming

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.100
 up through the ranks and we have a lot of very senior people are about

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.350
 to pass from the scene and we will lose all of their wisdom that

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.600
 they have gained over the years so we're trying to record their wisdoms

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.850
 we can pass on to future generations
