Occasionally you find you can't really do the work for which you were trained. When I was in Vietnam we had a man who was trained as a Morse code operator, and he could do it under practice conditions but real conditions it just turned out he wasn't very good at it. So there was no great problem, they just found another job that he could do.

"Decesions, Opportunities",,dandavis,What opportunities do you have to change career field?,"Well if it turns out you're not really good at it, or you don't want to do what you want to do and you want to change careers you might be able to do that. One of my best friends was an academy graduate, and his first job was as a missile officer and he hated being a missile officer, so he crossed transferred branches into their cryptologic community within his service, and was allowed to do that, but it was very difficult. And he was counseled by some fairly high ranking officers about why he shouldn't do that and how it would hurt his career and keep him from advancing. But he did get that finally approved, he made the switch and he retired as a full colonel in the airforce. So you can make a switch, but boy it's really tough to do that you'd almost be better to finish your tour of duty whatever it is and then enlist in another service, and ask for special duty in that other service in the field you really think you'd like to be in.

"Military, Opportunities, JobSpecific, Decisions",,dandavis,Can you change branches? Can you switch to the Army or Air Force?,"Sometimes the original choice you made for a branch of the service was based on erroneous notion of what they would be doing and after you've served, while especially if you've served with some of the other branches you may say ""gosh I wish I hadn't joined service A, I wish I'd join service B instead"". If that happens what are the options you have and I would have to tell you they're pretty limited. If you signed on the dotted line saying I will serve for six to eight years what have you signed for in service a. They put a lot of money and you investing in boot camp for your non productive and in your training where you're non productive and they finally got to the point where you're productive, they're disinclined to say ""well okay we'll just call it even and you can go join another armed force"". So it's very very difficult to change forces except between enlistments. I enlisted originally in the marine corps, did four years active duty then did two years of non pay reserve duty, in which I was going to drills but not getting paid for it. But I finished up my entire six year enlistment before I got my honorable discharge from themarine corps, reenlisted but in the Navy, enlisted the navy as an enlisted person then got commissioned later on. That worked out fine, the marine corps is happy, the navy's happy, the only problem is mine marine corps buddies arent happy because that they consider that an act of treason for me to join the Navy.

But what happens if you have a severe set of circumstances that have changed? If your health fails, or if your family has a dire need your the only surviving son for parents who cannot take care of themselves or something a nature. There are rare occasions when the military will allow you an early out to take care of those kinds of issues, but by and large I think you should never go into any contract with the intention of quitting it. And that's certainly goes for the military, because leaving the military in the lurch, you know if there is a missing person on the firing line, that means the remainder of us on the firing line or put in danger.

Even during the depression, they were not throwing people out of the military as long as you perform well and get good marks from you seniors, you can stay in the military twenty thirty years and retire. There occasionally have been rifts like after World War two, more people want to stay in the service than they had spots for, so some people had to be excused from the service. And that was particularly true in the officer ranks, enlistined people who had gotten elevated to officer ranks earlier in the war, when the war was over were hoping to stay as officers. But frequently they were told ""no we're sorry we just don't have enough officer billets so you must revert"" then most of those reversions were back to a senior enlisted rating. And then when it came time to retire, the person was allowed to retire at their rank that they had achieved in the reserve duty. And so that means if I were a captain and I got sent back to staff sergeant and then made my way up to master sergeant before I had time to retire, I probably would retire as a major because the captain normal would get promoted to major.

A lot of people get that obligation and opportunity. I enjoyed the training and was trained in Vietnamese.

To give you an example in cryptology without going into anything is pretty good classified if I can, we were all looking at how to recognize the particular non voice signal that is an electronic signal that was propagated, but had to be identified, and the question was 'could you identify it better by ear or by a oscilloscope tracing?' And the oscilloscope tracing gave you some parameters that could be compared for instance by digitizing the the aveform and analyzing the digitized waveform. We found strange slid off that the human ear was better at detecting the difference signals and it could detect that kind of equipment that was emitting that signal and surprisingly enough, it's hard to explain the physics in the physiology of this, it could even detect a particular machine. That is the signal is different enough that the human ear listening could couldn't even tell you what the difference was, but they can say that's machine in place A-prime and the other single was machine via place B prime.

After I'd work my way up from boot camp to morse code training to language school to some advanced training and then duty in combat zones. I got out of the Marine Corps and joined the Navy because I got all that the Marine Corps and had gotten out of the Marine Corps as a staff sergeant and A six, the Navy let me list as an E six cryptologic technician interpretive branch one. So it is a first class petty officer CTI one.

In my case, I did four years active duty in the Marine Corps and I've done about twenty good years in the reserves that means years where I went to drill once a month for an entire weekend and then did two weeks every year for training. More specialized training. I wound up putting a lot more time than that, but that was required for me to get some retirement status. So I am currently retired military, which means the President could call me back active duty if he ever wanted to. I am of an age where that might be pretty unlikely but I would have to say during World War Two people my age and physical fitness, I'd like  to say I I'm pretty fit I can walk two miles I get around pretty well,  I could be recalled active duty probably would be sent to the front line to do shooting but might be given a job instructing at the Roxy thing of that nature.",Are you currently in the Navy?,Are you in the Navy now?,Are you still in the Navy?,Are you still in the military?,Are you in the military now?,Did you leave the Navy?,did you leave the military?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's one of those things you have to know somebody pretty well to di in deep to your emotions. But let me just say this about my feelings of nine eleven. I was in Hawaii. I was one of the directors at the now a high performance computing center for the University of Hawai and my daughter called me and said Dad go to the TV there's a terrible thing happening in New York. So I got to the TV before the second tower was struck, and I watched all of that. I'd have to say the major impact on me was one of stirring of aggression. I like the old firehouse horse when he hears the alarm bell go off he charges to get ready to take the horse drawn fire engine to the fire site. I just wanted to go someplace and do something and wanted to be part of it. So my my first impression was one of of anger. How can anybody do that to us? And the second one was let's go get em.

"JobSpecific, Motivation",,dandavis,Why do you love your job?,"When I was in the Marine Corps boot camp, they came and got at a  line one day and said you've got to go over to this other building and talk to this guy who we don't even know who he is but he's from the government wants to talk to you. And when they came back from that the guy asks me all kinds of questions about whether I was clearable and criminal record everything in my life that was embarassing. And I thought, well that's really strange was going on there. And when the workers came out our platoon commander which was an E seven gunnery sergeant in the Marine Corps read out orders he read out my orders I was ordered to school to learn twenty five seventy one divys and our platoon commander as an E seve, his major job in the Marine Corp was communications. So he'd hanedle the radios between different units in the Marine Corps and he got me aside and he said you're going to love this duty.  And little did I know how much I really was going to love it. When I finally get to the good lord and can talk to him,  I will say thank you lord putting me in that line of work. I loved every every every second of it. It was so exciting, was so intellectually challenging was, so much fun. And then I got out in civilian life, stayed with cryptology in the reserves. Lived out civilian life and bungered around out, I was a lawyer for ten years with my dad until he died. But I didn't like that very much. But I got back into computer research and again I felt something I'm really really loved. So I love computing. I love working on computers. I love envisioning what you can do with a computer. Something a lot of people don't have his vision they can do what they're told that they can't see. Wow, we could do this for that you know and so one of things I really love my job in academia is you're given an opportunity to talk about your vision, sell your vision and work on your vision, so those are all things I really love about both my military and my civilian careers.",What makes you love your job?,Why do you like what you do?,Why do you enjoy what you do?,What is good about what you do?,What do you love about the Navy?,what do you like about the Navy?,do you like what you do?,Do you enjoy your career?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And that's got to make people feel better about themselves. So those are some of the benefits you get in the Navy or the Marine Corps or the Army or the Airforce.

It's hard to say about the military, but I think one thing that gets romantisized is if you love the way people look in uniform. You look at the recruiting posters and they're the guys in there dress blue you know bell bottoms sailor uniform looking very athletic and and romantic in their Old World style. You get the wind listed in the officers in their dress uniforms you know just looking like a million dollars. They don't very often have too many posters showing your your work uniform So the entire life is not spent yeah you know where you dress uniform and going to parties. A chaplain told me once it almost every incident puts in for embassy duty when gets commission you don't get embassy duty until you're at the other end of your career, a commander or  a captain and so that that could be overly romanticize. How you can travel the world and become an embassy aid or something like that doesn't happened very much. But by and large, people understand.

"Misconceptions, Military",Navy,dandavis,What are some of the common misconceptions about the Navy?,I think a major misconception about the Navy is that the leadership barking orders and being snotty to everybody. I feel like the Navy and to some degree in the Marine Corps are much more management oriented. Your commanding officer in the junior officers and the senior petty officers and senior NCOs over you are there to try to make your job useful and to keep you in good shape and your morale up. So I think it is a misconception that everybody in the military is marked net that just harsh treatment to end up high display there's a lot more it's more team spirit much more a quarterback in the huddle then the drill instructors screaming at you on the drill field and that's that's been my experience and I think a lot of people still make that mistake largely driven by movies who seemed invariably characterized lawsuits as stupid and malicious and evil and violent people and that's just not been my experience with,What are some of the common misconceptions about your field?,How are people fooled about what you do for a living?,Do people get the wrong idea about what you do?,What are the myths about what you do?,Do the movies and TV portray your job well?,Is you work as stressful as it is shown on TV?,Is the Navy really snooty?,Is the Navy really management oriented?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Culture,Navy,dandavis,What makes the navy different than other branches of the military?,"Each branch of the military has its own personality within them. The branches of the military have their own personality. The personality of the people in cryptology were different the personality of the guys we're in aviation. And they were different from the guys who were in the infantry units in the Marine Corps. But the marine corps has a personality that is largely let's figure out where we're going to and then let's go there come hell or high water. So the they're very very much let's get something happening and that's that differentiates from so many of the other services. Here the navy on the other hand, I think in their personality is largely we have huge complex and interdependent sets of equipment and systems on ships. And therefore we must be very technical. We must understand each other's jobs. We must know exactly what the other guy whose job is and how is equipment works. And we as best we can, we need to be able to fill in for him if he can't do his job. And so so that there's a kind of a almost a technical orientation the probably goes back to the good old days where you know the people who were allowed to go aloft and set to sales had to know what they were doing. They were just following directions they had to know how to sail a ship in order there was going to be big trouble. So there isn't a difference there. the airforce is oriented toward getting the pilots in the sky and recovered aircraft and that leads to kind of the separation of pilots and then the Russian airforce. But it's a separation of works well because everybody's place seeing together. The army is so diverse it's hard to see any single personality. But there is that solid feeling that,  ""hey we are the guys who really gets the job done and make it happen,""  everybody else holds out you can drop bombs you could sales there in your ships. You know the Marines can help us get ashore,  but when it comes time to move across the land and we're the guys who have to get it done and so we are the guys you have to rely on.","How does the Navy differ from the Army, Air Force and Marines?",Are the other services like the Navy?,Do the other services compare with the Navy?,How is the Navy different from other services?,what's the difference between the navy and the army?,what is the difference between the navy and the army?,How is the Navy vs. Army?,Is the Navy or army better?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Military, Decisions, Advice, Culture",,dandavis,What branch of the military should I go into?,"Ssometimes issues raised what branch of the military is the right branch for me to enter. And that's a tough question the answer there so many factors that go into. One is your physical aggressiveness and physical talents. People in the Marine Corps you tend to be very physically aggressive and very athletic. And the Marines are looking for guys who were basically almost pro athlete kind of things. It's not to say the navy seals are any slouch either but the Navy as a whole doesn't focus so much on that kind of issue. So the marine corps is a good place to go if if you're really very competitive, aggressive, and athletic. On the other hand, the Navy is a good field going to if you're really into techno technical systems making the technical systems go together and you're carried away to some degree by the romance of the sea. And there is that romance for a lot of us and you'll you'll find that no matter where you go. The army's good place to go into if you have very specific requirements because the army has so many jobs that they can hit your job requirement. If you wanna be a truck mechanic and that's what you really wanted to do. I think the army would give you the best chance of getting into picking a specific field like that. Again though, if you if you're the athletics and competitive can be an army paratrooper and those guys crazy group of guys. The airforce is very good if you say, I want to fight my war in short sleeves you know I like doing technical stuff, I'm willing to take the risk, I don't want to be in a trench but I would be in the thick of the fight. One of the highest casualty rates in World War two was the eighth airforce, but they flew home every night if you flew home without getting killed. You flew home every night and you slept in your boat can get good food and you were safe for the night you know you didn't have to worry about love poor soldiers who were in the battle of the bulge standing up all in the freezing cold for fear of being overrun by the Germans. So the airforce is a different kettle of fish but very slow motion rates in the airforce sue they give me a good life I don't care what rank I might be a good good rules to go by if for airforce people.",Which branch is the best?,How do I decide what branch to go into?,What branches of the military can I go into?,What are the best branches of the military?,Which branch of the military should I join?,How do I decide which part of the military to go into?,What about the army?,What do all the branches of the military do?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Misconceptions, JobSpecific, STEM",,dandavis,What are some of the common misconceptions about (your STEMÂ field)?,"I think the most common misconception about my STEM field is computer programming and computer research is frequently is seen as being one hundred percent devoted to writing computer code or working on computer machinery. But the fact of the matter is I don't know poll myself and kept track of this the vast majority of your time over your career is going to be reading and writing English. Not C++ or Fortran or Java. So you better get good at writing English so what other misconceptions is if I am a good Java  writer to find a good C programmer if I can knock off Fortran in my sleep I don't have to know English. Wrong you're gonna have to know English for a number of reasons that I can discuss later if you'd like. In the military one of the misconceptions about the military is that everybody in the military gets a rifle and ammunition and they go shoot at people even in the army that's not true. In the army, only one quarter of the people go to combat arms - infantry armor, paratroops and artillery are the the for combat arms. If you're one of the one in four who gets into combat arms chances are only one and two that you are having to do with the weapon. You know it's if you go on to armour for instance you're just as likely to be a fuel tone tray a fuel truck driver as you are to be a tank drive. So the army has a lot less people running around shooting people in the whole thing. You know we're already down to an eighth to the people you know half of those people who see combat that's sixteen and the people who see combat only have what we get to fire their weapons for one reason or another so that's one third it's only one thirty people in the army ever gonna fires weapons. And then you'll talk to guide the infantry got sent to Afghanistan so what about over their shot, but yeah but not everybody went to Afghanistan with him a lot of guys go to Afghanistan. I've known tons who never saw the enemy, they never got fireworks weapon anybody. So that's a major misconception that military school people go around killing people with a weapon.

JobSpecific,,dandavis,How has work day changed over your career?,looking at like two careers workday change significantly as I got more and more senior well let's start off with the military career I started out as a junior listed mail order everything I was doing was being somebody else told me he should go here go there to be there then do this and just so I just had to follow orders get about and the first two years of my time in the marine corps were spent in schools one kind or another so it's mainly just studying and eating and enjoying life my year in Vietnam I was on watch standing which means for eight hours every day of the week seven days a week I wasn't doing my linguistic duties and that was a different way to get through life when I got into the reserves in the military I start out again as a mid level in the person basically just taking training a life but then as I became an officer of the keyboard more someone who had organized and more Morgan who someone who had a right so I spent a lot of my time writing up players ready valuations writing up proposals training and getting ready for inspections and so my day buried as I got more and more senior to appoint right got where it was just almost always writing evaluations and running meetings of the only things I did by the time I got out in civilian life same kind of trend my day started out doing more technical things but then more and more got to be doing writing and playing visioning talking as as I went along silly day has changed in both cases,How has your view of this line of work changed over time?,"Have you changed your opinion about this line of work and if so, how?",Has your opinion of your job altered?,What about your attitude change concerning your profession?,Has your view of this work changed and how?,How has the career changed over time?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Travel, Background",Navy,dandavis,"Where did you have to move in your career, and how did that change things each time?","Both of the military and your civilian life you're gonna find a lot of times we have to move and that's going to change up things. One of the good things about being in the military if you like moving is that you're not stuck in one place for the rest your life and you're not stuck with one group of people you get to meet new people if you love people you get to meet new people you love if you don't love people you get to get away from the people you don't want. So it's it works out well both ways and when you move the military's particularly adept at accepting new people into the unit because there's always someone new coming into the unit and you remember when you're the new guy and how well you were treated or poorly then you try to treat the new guys that way too. So that's that's really good deal. In civilian life it's a little tougher when you move, because people some stick to one place and never move in their entire life but a lot of people do move around so one inside have had I would warn you about is most new guys when they get to the new place say wait a minute here's how we did in the old place and that work really well don't don't jump on that right away don't jump on that right away wait and maybe the way they do it in the new place works well for them and your only that you get it worked well for you guys would work so just peace you know get get in tune with the new way the way they do it and then then make a decision thing we can improve this little by borrowing this little thing from the old way.

Military,,dandavis,What do you find unique about the military?,"I think the greatest whole work in the military is the camaraderie of the unit camaraderie that allows you to get through combat while she gets you personal loss, allows you to get through injury,  allows you to get through incredible stress and survive that's you see some of that in civilian life. You see some more of it in some kinds of civilian life like police work or firefighting well you get that kind kind of camaraderie but I think it's really a hallmark of the military. The other hallmarks of the military and in the American experience anyway as is the rotation system where you hardly ever any place longer than about two years. So things are always changing, you jobs changing. You work you're doing its changing, the kind of work you are doing is chaning. You're not just going to be a letter carrier for your entire years of life. My father in law did nothing but deliver the mail for the post office fourty years and he loved that.

I will see cryptologic linguist other people were Morse code operators other people were electronics experts other people studied radars in the walk so there are all kinds of different cryptologist but I think the the the civilian field I have which is high performance computing what is unique about it is we're always on the cutting edge because high performance computing doesn't say this is a high performance computer. It's kind of a loose definition high performance computer is the most powerful kind you have now is that the vector computer like the crates or is it like the Intel delta parallel computer or is it an accelerated computer using GPGUs general purpose graphics processing unit co-processers or is it one of the new quantum computers like we have here at USC. All those are high performance computers and so that's a unique part of that is it's a loose definition with a lot of different technologies it's always exciting always new and always on the cutting edge which means you got ten people said this is great to get the overall you got a hundred people over here saying well oh gosh not another set of empty promises you didn't deliver it last time and just go crazy about it.

On-base pitted percentage might be a better example of that but you get the drift. I think failure is well accepted in both fields failure even the military of course I can be a mire failure you didn't defend your position well enough and therefore some untoward things happen or could be a major failure you failed in a way that resultants in somebody good getting killed and not achieving admission. So the one thing about the military is I think they're very forgiving of failure but all of the snow the failure might cause somebody's life, unnecessarily and that and many different things, but in terms of the management reaction to that kind of failure I think both academia and military were pretty good at saying we knew you were out on a limb you know if you fell off you fell off we're sorry but we will only get you.",How accepting of failure is this work environment when a good and honest effort was made?,"If you screw up, but worked hard, do you get another chance?","Is failure, even if it is not your fault, held against you?",Do you get blamed if something does not work?,How severe is failure at work?,What would happen if you mess up?,How bad it is when you screw up something in the Navy?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The military really does give you that opportunity and it sets out early on you know the day you enlist they give you and enlistment or a commission you know who the top dogs.

"STEM, JobSpecific",Navy,dandavis,Describe the technological environment in which you've worked.,When you talk about the environment you'll be facing once you get into a job that can vary all over the map both civilian and military life. In  military life I have done my technical tasks in a room full of electronic equipment in a carefully air conditioned and beautiful modern building with restrooms down the hall and a snack bar that I can get to easily and all the comforts of home. I've also done my job with a single radio and antenna in a tent in the cold weather in North America and I've also done my job in a bunker right on the DMZ in Vietnam where I was one of the few people in that area who even knew what I was doing for a living.

Sometimes these may be associations, professional associations, sometimes they may be sections of the military for instance they're in charge of getting you trained and educated to move up the ranks so you have to be alerted. So in my case I was able to move ahead in the military because there were a number of schools that were set up in their number of curricula set up that would encourage you to proceed further in cryptology about a lot of the work and if you could tell cryptology was personal study you know I could talk to you for hours about the history of cryptology and the military throughout the ages and and that was all part of my skill as a cryptologist. I also have studied a plethora of foreign languages so that when we were in Vietnam for instance I was to go to the linguist when somebody heavy foreign language they recognize they would bring it to me and say what languages is it and I would be able to tell not because that military training helped me learn that because my own private study had exposed me to those languages someplace where I can remember what they were like and that was that was useful. In the civilian world, the association of computing machinery (ACM) which is the major professional organization for people doing research in the computers and computer usage  and they've been very good about keeping me informed about what's going on what jobs are available.

In the military, the work I did, cryptology, there are numerous examples in history about the effect of cryptology. The work from World War two were probably the most at stake was the fact that the US solve the Japanese naval codes in World War two allowed them to predict exactly what the Japanese were planning to do for the battle of midway and ambush the Japanese fleet, thereby sinking a huge number of Japanese carriers, I think three or four carries with some fair along with their pilots in airplanes and made it such that the Japanese never could replace, probably the major turning point in World War two in the Pacific. In the Atlantic, our ability to break because the Germans were using to station their submarines allowed us to win the war by keeping the sea lanes open to Great Britain so that's been a big difference.

We were standing watch one night on the outside perimeter line around in Phu Bai, Vietnam and I was there was an army staff sergeant and another marine corps sergeant and the army staff sergeant regular ran the bunker and the other sergeant and I were just there helping out that night in the army staff sergeant dog started barking, so we thought maybe there was some Vietcong or North Vietnamese army people who had gotten through the wire and were out of the field where the dog was barking so we said well I guess we gotta go out and check so the only thing I had with me that night was my M1911 A-145 automatic pistol and the army sergeant had an M16 so we were about a hundred meters one direction from the bunker and I was a hundred meters in the other direction so here I am standing out in this field about knee high grass of while the sergeant who stayed in the bunker called one of the arms bunkers the shooting bunkers out on the perimeter line and told to fire a pop up flares, so there's a little rocket propelled flare that goes whoosh and then as a flare so you see can see and I'm standing out there in the grass waiting for this flare to go off hoping that I do the right thing if we went off all all of a sudden it occured to me that I had was this nineteen eleven was seven rounds in the magazine all I had was seven bullets from a handgun I suppose what happens with a far off that flare of a whole company of Vietnamese soldiers stand up from the middle of the grass and they've all got rocket propelled grenade launchers and I sat there and I sat there sat there and then it got tense quiet and finally the flare went off. I must have almost jumped about three feet straight in the air when that sucker went off so if there was a VC in the grass, I would not be able to see him because I was up way up in the air when that's didn't see anybody stood out there for another couple minutes to make sure it in here but he tried to get through the grass away from me we went back to the bunker later on that day we saw the dark bog barkinh at another dog somewhere down on the fence line and so we think that's what the dog was barking at the previous night so that's to me that was pretty funny when I come to think of it.",make me laugh,what tickles you,tell me something funny.,Narrate a funny story.,have you ever been in australia?,tell me a story.,do you know any funny stories?,Are there any funny moments?,What’s your favorite joke?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sometimes the challenges are intellectual- understanding high level mathematical concepts involved in practicing law or new high performance computing research, or in the military, decrypting the varying kinds of communications can be challenging in a way. But I think that things that stick out most in my mind in terms of challenges are working with people- the most challenging thing you have to do is learning how to work most effectively with the team and make sure the team remains cohesive and goal directed. And if you can do that you can overcome virtually everything if you lose either cohesion or goal direction, then the team is just treading water and the morale goes in the tank and the danger goes up.

I worked with a lot of electronic gear- maintaining and repairing and optimizing as we went along. So that was very useful to me. When I got out of the military I when I first started back in college they were offering some introductory courses in computer programming and this was brand new in computers because there were those times kinds of things before that.

"Motivation, Background, JobSpecific",,dandavis,Why did you choose this career path?,"Many people in life choose a career early in their life my oldest brother in high school decided that he wanted to be a veterinarian and have a large animal veterinary practice in the small town in the rocky mountain west. He grew up in Illinois went to university of Illinois got a degree in chemistry, then got admitted to veterinary medical school which in Illinois is harder to get into the medical school is and got a DVM and became a veterinarian moved we will Wyoming and lasted exactly five and a half years. He hated it, he couldn't do it he was there that he was a wonderful veterinarian but he wasn't good at the the personal part of being a veterinarian. So he left that and went to work for a number of large organizations that were doing research and he wound up not only doing research, but he finally wound up living on the east river in New York City working for two different large firms- Pfizer and Ciba - doing drug registration internationally. So when the new drug was produced by one of those firms for veterinary use, he would go to these foreign countries and figure out how to get the license so it can be sold there. So basically what he wound up doing was something was more legal work than veterinary medical work. How did I choose my career, unlike my oldest brother I just kind of waltzed into it I got picked for cryptology by the marine corps and loved it. I practiced law with my dad for a few years did like that very much. Went back to academia and I've loved it in academia. And I'm in academia largely because the navy reserve buddy of mine no what have you once said what it's going to work for us it might merit in doing research and that's where I got started with Martin Marietta and then I got hired by Caltech, fom mark Marietta.

The few murders that happen in Vietnam were fraggings, that is throwing a hand grenade in to somebody, usually a senior officer, or enlisted person. And a lot of that was racially motivated.

And at that juncture usually get about half your base pay but none of your housing allowances, then you get medical benefits for the rest your life that is anytime you get to a military hospital will take care of you, if you get to the civilian doctor there's something called tricare, that pays kind of like insurance. So you can be taken care of. If you're a reservist the retirement benefits don't start when you retire, they started age sixty. So you have to wait until age sixty before you can retire. And that's still a pretty good deal because at age sixty, then you get a fraction of what the active duty people get, depending on how much drilling you did and how often you went on active duty, you know the like. They have a formulated a calculator that comes up with some portion, but it's it's a nice little stipend that goes longer. So security from your school and work, that is makes it up. It's worthwhile retiring and at age sixty you get the tricare if you want it or if you close to a military base you can go there for medical care as well",how do you plan for getting out of the military?,what do you do when you retire from the Navy?,what benefits do retirees get?,what is Navy retirement?,Do you get retirement benefits in the Navy?,What benefits do you get after your retirement in your field?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Military, Opportunities, Resources",,dandavis,Describe the hiring process.,"The hiring process is a difficult one for me to describe with any certainty because I've gone through several and none of them I think has been standard. In almost every case someone inside of the organization to which I was being hired knew about me had asked me to join up with that organization, the only difference would have been the when I joined the marine corps in that case I just went and talked all 4 military recruiters, Air Force army navy and marine corps, and basically ask them who will guarantee me a chance go to Vietnam. And the marine corps was the ones who said ""yeah if you join up you're going to Vietnam"" so that's all there is to it. But when I went into lawm after I got out of law school at new practice with my father who had practiced in Colorado springs for years, so there wasn't any hiring process there, just and work with them. And when he passed away I, you know, exactly what you saw was still practicing law in one of my good friends from the reserve unit where I was working said ""you know I know you're not happy practicing law but why don't you join mark Marietta and work for us on this technical project that requires the kind of clearance you have"". And so I said ""well that's pretty good I'll do that"". So I went there. And then another friend of mine from the, at mark Marietta who's also reservist said ""you know they need somebody out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Mark Marietta to work out there went you see if they'll transfer you out there"", because my wife loves the ocean I thought well that's good will go to Los Angeles and then she'll be able to go to the ocean more. So I got that job because somebody suggested. And while I was at JPL, a project came up that we were kind of briefed on, and we were working on, and fellow who was in the project was the head of the high performance computing center at Caltech, and he kinda liked me, so he said ""Dan, why don't you quit working at JPL for mark and other income work for Caltech and help me run this supercomputing centers"". So I became the assistant director there, again a friend, and then on my own kind of I got to know some people at University of Southern California and one of them said, ""why don't you come to university of Southern California, we'll pay you more than cal tech does"", which is always an inducement. And so I did that and that worked out fine. And then some people who knew me asked me to come try to get the high performance computing center for the university of Hawaii, and I did that so I worked out there for awhile and that that also was kind of fun. And we got to got to do that, so I didn't really have a hiring process in any of those I just kind of somebody grease the skids for me and I got right in.

"Training, Military",Navy,dandavis,Describe the initial training.,"Other than the service, I got virtually no initial training for any of the jobs. I learned what I learned in college I learned what I learned from getting through life and I apply those lessons. A lot of the other training I've done, I've done on my own and I it's stood me in good stead so far. Virtually all the computer programming I know I've learned by buying a book and doing it that way. That was even true in the practice of law to some degree, the biggest case I ever won in the practice of law was a jury trial and I just bought a book on how to try this particular kind of case it was a criminal felony, how to try criminal felonies in a jury trial and I read the book and I did it, and we won. So a very interesting way to get through life. Of course most corporations and universities have some kind of introductory training, but they basically speaking they just as soon get hit the ground with your feet running and then you'll be off after the real goals.",what was your initial career training like?,did someone show you the ropes?,were you sent to training when joining?,what are the first days at work like?,what is it like to join the Navy?,What is the first year like in the Navy?,Was the first year hard?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Training, Military",Navy,dandavis,What is bootcamp like?,"Marine corps boot camp was one of the most challenging things I've ever done in my life I'm not very athletic and later on in life I found out that hypothyroid which means I didn't develop a lot of upper body strength and muscle mass when I was growing up. So boot camp was a real challenge for me because you get a lot of P. T. you ran everywhere you're constantly being harassed by the drill instructors . You had a lot to learn, but I'm pretty smart so I learned pretty fast they try to put a lot of pressure on this but I was older than mostly kids in boot camp I was in my early twenties most of them are like eighteen or so so I handle that kind of screaming and yelling better than they did, didn't make a difference to me what that drill instructor called me, I kind of thought the profanity was kind of funny. But boot camp is one part of the military that you're glad you did and you're glad it's behind you, and glad you don't have to do again.",tell me more about the bootcamp,how is the bootcamp?,is it hard to survive in the bootcamp?,What can you tell about the military bootcamp?,Is the military bootcamp as hard as it is rumoured to be?,Did you find the bootcamp really difficult?,What do you do in the Bootcamp?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Military,Navy,dandavis,Who do I talk to if I'm interested in joining the military?,"I think the most important people to talk to if you're interested during the military are people you can trust who are in the military who'll give you good data. do not take their analysis in the military correctly. They will sometimes do you the wrong direction, if they didn't like it you'll be able to perceive that very quickly. If they didn't like it listen to it and think ""oh here's what a person who didn't like it will tell you"" and try to find somebody who did like it to give you the other side of the story. So this is critical to me, don't just go by what one person tells you to talk to several people with several different views. When I was commanding officer of the navy reserve unit occasionally we'd get people want to join our reserve unit, and I generally would try to get them a chance to talk to somebody who really loved it and another one of th guys who really didn't care for it much it was going to get out after he served his tour. That would give the best chance to find out what was really like. But listen carefully, intermalize what people say and ask factual questions, well he didn't like it, ""what was it like?"" ""what did you do?"" ""what you do every day?"" ""what was that like?"" ""is that what they did the following day?"" You don't try it trying to pin them down because otherwise you get their kind of political opinion about it, rather than how they felt. It's amazing to me how many people I've talked to in the military said I hated my time there. I ask ""where were you stationed and what were you duties and what did you do for fun?"" And after you talked a little while I've had two or three of them say to me you know now that I think about it I really did have a pretty good time. You know so listen listen critically but talk to everybody, and then go talk to every recruiter you can and listen critically they're trying to talk you into joining their service what what are they saying that you can take with a grain of salt and where they say you can take to the bank",what are good sources of information in military?,are there people to whom I should talk about this career path?,who should I avoid talking to when considering this kind of work?,who can I get advice about military from?,what are good sources of information in navy?,who can I get advice about navy from?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Military, Culture",Navy,dandavis,What is dress attire in the Navy?,"Attire in the navy has changed some since I was on active duty. Used to be you had to wear your dress uniform a lot more than you do now it used to be against regulations to run around and your utility a work uniform, now everybody seems they camouflage work uniforms or just the berries and they wear them all the time they wear them in downtown. So things things change, I am currently wearing the shirt to dress blue uniform over which you typically wear the blue coat double breasted brass buttoned blue coat. But it in an office setting you take them off and just have your raw shoulder boards showing your rank, in this case I'm a commander that has three stripes, and a star showing that I am an on-officer that is I'm a fighter, not the staff officer like a chaplain or a lawyer jag corps, or medical corps, dental corps, Pleiku, or those sorts of things are considered staff office",can you tell me when you wear which uniforms?,what do all the uniforms mean?,do you get different uniforms as you are promoted?,does the Navy buy all your uniforms?,do you always have to wear a uniform?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Military, Culture",Navy,dandavis,To what extent does the military adhere to tight schedules both long term and daily?,"I'm a great student of military history and naval history I enjoy reading about it. I think it's critical, I think it's something everybody should know. One of the things you find out about military or the navy is it is absolutely vital that people are where they're supposed to be when they're supposed to be there. If you're in the middle of the battle and you're expecting some unit to appear at some time to relieve you from pressure from that direction, and they don't appear, people will die. And so you start off with the military that says let's inculcate a tradition of when the commanding officer says ""I want you at that place at that time"" you're there then. I have often told young people going in the military you'll never get in a really really bad trouble if you where you're supposed to be when you're supposed to be there. If you're in the wrong uniform they may scream at you, if you don't have your weapon ready day may scream at you, if you don't have the equipment you need, somebody may be upset with but if you're there when you're supposed to be there somebody will find some use for you, and they will not think ill of you. So that's why the military adheres to tight schedules and why you would be well served if you get on board with that theory and do what you're supposed to do when you're supposed to do it.

Background,,dandavis,How can I request to work in a certain area or field?,"When I enlisted in the marine corps, you only had two choices; you did very well on the way entry test, even the recruiters office you could pick aviation options. That meant you're for sure you would not go in the infantry, you'd go in an anaviation option of some kind or another. These days things have changed entirely, the different services have different ways of testing you ahead of time and can guarantee you occupational field. So I'm not exactly sure how that works so I would urge you to talk to your recruiter about that and don't put up with ""well yeah I'll usually or frequently, or maybe, you know"" what are they guaranteeing you is going to happen. You can't get it in writing but at least pin them down to not just give you fluffy statements but to say yes this will happen.

"Opportunities, Fit, Military",Navy,dandavis,What was the most difficult part of your training?,"The most difficult part of my training was physical training. PT, and exercise is not one of my fortes and I hated it, and I still hate it. So that's the most difficult part of all of my military training and upkeep. But the one good thing about the military's it does make sure you don't get out of line very much with your weight and your fitness. So even a day even though and no longer active in the military I get up every morning and walk a couple miles, kept my weight pretty much down, a little over, I probably should be two twenty I'm really about two thirty five. But you know that keep it down to, but that's that's difficult. Intellectually their training system is that, they trained you well they give you a lot of legs up to make sure you're doing alright. Training's good.

"Money, Military",,dandavis,How does an officer's/non-officer's salary compare to civilian salaries?,"You have it luckier than I did. When I enlisted in the marine corps, the pay scales were sacrificial. These were in the days of the draft so there were plenty of people who were low ranking enlisted people that can be gotten you know by order of the president United States they just drafted them, so I think my first pay back in sixty seven was about sixty dollars a month, and if you took into account inflation, that would probably be about to two hundred and forty to four hundred dollars a month today. So it is pretty low, but it was was plenty, who was plenty you lived in the barracks. You drank beer for a quarter at the club and you didn't have it in a car virtually no one of the barracks had a car. These days the official pay is much better than that and I would urge you to go online and just type in military pay scales and the current pay scale come up in front of you and show you how much you get paid. So it's a little over an you first start out as an E1 but you get promoted up to E3 very fast, And E4 probably within a year or so. So then then you start getting a little better, and by the time you get in the senior ranks it pays comparable to civilian life in a lot of ways and the same with officers. A captain in the navy or a colonel in the airforce marine corps or army make the kind of money that the manager at that level would be getting an industry. And the entire package is pretty good because you not only get pay, but if you live off base they give you housing loans which is non taxed and so I the pay is not bad and when you go on base these days virtually everybody even the brand new enlisted people have a car or motorcycle or both, so pay's pretty good.",will my pay be better or worse than that of a civilian?,what is the pay like outside the military?,will I make more or less than non-military people?,will I make more money if I join the military?,Do you get a handsome pay in the military?,Do you think you would have earned more as a civilian ?,Does military provide renumeration better than civilian life?,Does military provide you with satisfactory monetary benefits?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Military, Culture",Navy,dandavis,How would you describe the work culture of the Navy?,"I believe the work culture marine corps and navy is different from civilian life in that it focuses on team effort more than anything else I would I would describe that work effort is much more like a team sport like baseball or football where there is a great deal of coordination a great deal of reliance on each other a great deal of doing what you need to be doing so you won't let the team down. I am kind of the webmaster and the communications guy for my high school alumni class, and when I put out a request ""please let me know what color the eyes of your grandchildren"" or anything like that, the people I hear back from the first are my military veterans, because one of the things you learn in the military is 'we're all in this together, everybody's got a job to do, and one of my jobs is to make sure that I don't make anybody else's job harder' so if somebody asked me clean up your bunk, clean up your bunk because otherwise they can do for you. If somebody asked me what color eyes do your grandchildren have, I will I respond right away so that they don't have to come running down and ask me again.

"Military, JobSpecific, Travel",Navy,dandavis,How significant is there a chance of being deployed?,"Deployments, and getting called up as a reservist and seeing the active duty in a combat zone are all at of the behest of the national security apparatus. The commander in chief the president of the United states has the ability to order you wherever you are needed. And rather than something to be astued, or feared or worried about, I think deployment should be a thing of a goal people in your career want to be deployed so they can get activity and that will allow them to achieve wht they want to achieve. Even those who are reservist frequently want to get the job done and so they will look for a chance to deploy. Let me tell you a quick story. During the first Iraq war the commander of naval security group wanted to prove to his superiors that he really did not need reservists, so he issued orders that no reservist would be called up for the cryptologic community in the navy during the Iraq war. That was a huge disappointment to my people in Denver, huge disappointment. So I went down the hall to the intelligence community because they had been called up and some of the guys had gone to Iraq, and I said ""look we've all got high level clearances, we're all college educated, most of us have advanced degrees, we're technically competent, we know what we're doing we probably could function as intelligence officers if you want us to"" and he said ""that's great because I got a draft coming home from Iraq right now and we don't have enough people to replace him and I hate to send some of these guys back for the second tour, but we'll take your entire boardroom, that is all your officers and most your chief petty officers if they want to go"". One hundred percent of my officers said ""I want to do that"", the navy will not order me to do that I want to volunteer I want to go do that part of my job. So that's why I think you should look forward to deployment not regret one or trying to avoid one.",how often do you go to sea?,will I get deployed?,how much will I be away from my family?,does everyone get deployed?,do I have to leave home if I am in the military?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lifestyle, Military, Benefits",Navy,dandavis,What things are there for me to do on a ship?,"If you're asking me about activities on the ship and what happens on cruises, I have to tell you that I'm the wrong guy to ask. As a cryptologist, a hundred percent of my duty has been from land based cryptologic activities. I've been on about a dozen navy ships in my life but for less than a day in each case, generally visiting the cryptologic units on board to find out how their life is going. So from them what I've learned is life at sea is very busy. Sometimes working so much you have very little time left except for just eating and sleeping and getting your clothes washed and take care yourself than doing some PT. But largely on board a ship a lot of time spent reading, lot of time spent watching DVDs, of course the communications the way they are now, often you can call home, so that's the sort of thing you can do on a ship.","if I am at sea, what can I do to relax?",is there free time to do stuff on a ship?,what kinds of break activity is there at sea?,Is a ship boring?,how do you cure boredom on a ship?,what do you do for fun on a ship?,do you watch tv or movies on a ship?,What tv shows do you watch?,How do you cure boredom on the ship?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But you have to look in your own soul, the kind of person you are and what you're looking for in life. I enjoyed the team effort, I enjoy technology, I enjoy machinery. I am at peace when I'm on a large peace of equipment that that I can feel vibrating underneath my feet. There's a life to that kind of machinery that I don't get any place else.

I wanted to pursue family life professional goals there were not supported by the active duty military.

"Lifestyle, Military, Advice",Navy,dandavis,"How will my relationship with my friends or family members be affected if I join the navy, and what advice should I give them?","One of the most critical features of military life is enforced separation from your loved ones, your family, and your friends. This is not too bad in this day and age, you need to remember that back in the early part of the eighteenth century, New England whalers would leave on equal shifts and be gone for two two and a half years was no communication all to their spouse or their parents, or the siblings or their friends. And then they would come back for a short period time and then got another ship and take off again. You don't see that kind of separation, but there will be some separation. For instance when you're in boot camp typically speaking you will not be allowed to communicate other than by letter to anybody outside of yor boot camp group, your platoon, or flight or batallion, or whatever that they call it in your service. So the advice I think you should give your your family is ""I will be going I will appreciate any way you can communicate with me, I would still be part of your life, so keep me up on what's going on, and know that I'm thinking of you and I'll try to communicate with you whenever I get a chance.""",can my being in the Navy worry my family and friends?,how do I tell my family or parents that I am joining the military?,what should I tell my folks about the Navy?,will my relationships suffer from being in the Navy?,"being in the navy, is it difficult for you to have a relationship?",can you have a relationship in the Navy?,what do you tell your family?,will my family be worried about me?,what will my family think of the military?,What did your parents want you to do?,What do your parents think about your career?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Education, Benefits, Military",Navy,dandavis,How do the educational benefits of the military work?,"There are a number of educational possibilities in the military and let's take these kind of from the ground up. The first is while you're on active duty you can apply for, if you're so inclined or qualified, the Naval Academy. You can apply to get support to get a degree in their number ways that they will support getting associates degree or a bachelor's degree. But if you already have a bachelor's degree, officers can apply to go to the naval postgraduate school and get an advanced degree there. There some officers allowed to go to school and college and and get a PhD for a few years. Those are all possibilities while you're in the service after you get out of the service you got the GI bill and those benefits change from time to time, so the best thing there is to double check with your recruiter, what they're currently offering you, how it works. My father went to law school on the GI bill I went to undergrad, finished up my undergraduate, and then went on to law on the GI bill.

"Growth/learning, Future",,dandavis,What is the advancement potential in the field? What is a typical path?,"I've had a number of careers both in civilian and military life, and they have kind of different advancement paths. The advancement path in the military is pretty regularized and it doesn't vary a whole lot by field. I mean cryptologists get advanced about the same with electronics technicians get advanced. It may be a little slower in the boatswain's mate group but not much. Advancement in the officer ranks again is pretty regularized, and typically it is: you get a promotion when you start out, you start out as a oh-one in the E1, and then after a certain number of months or years you're eligible for promotion and based on your the way of work you're either promoted not promote. And then each time you're getting a little more. So with an officer for instance starting as an O1, which is an insane hours attended up in four years you probably made it up to O3, which would be a captain in the army or a lieutenant in the navy, and you probably get that about the end of your first agreement to serve and a lot of people get out of the service at that time. And then you keep working your way up and typically speaking you make captain or colonel about year twenty five or so. And then you might have a chance of making admiral, but very few people make admiral. Enlisted people same thing they move up to the union, enlist in ranks pretty quick until you get up to about E6, E7, then it slows up a bit into you get all for the law. So that advancement paths that way. In academia you have two different advancement paths. One his tenure track is very difficult almost always requires a PhD, very hard to get a tenure track position and then frankly ten years denied to you and you gotta go to work for the government or something.

be able to make any money in computers because soon there will only be two or three big computers in this nation state probably at big universities like one of cal tech and wanted in my tea and one at university of Illinois and everybody would use those computers and they're all feel very few compu to programmers doing all the program so I did not pursue it because I didn't think it was a growing field from what he told me and I think he was giving me good honest advice but it was certainly wrong because of course now everybody in his uncle has a computer not only on his desk but sometimes on his wrist watch and half the people playing with it do a little programming one kind or another so that's what's changed it's just huge compared to what we thought it would be in nineteen seventy one how much free time have you had in your career my career has provided me more for it was a wonderfully yeah just capital both of my crews who provided me more free time than I could use I'd you know you'd be surprised how much of the time when I get free time I spend it program and because that's what I love to do I spend it writing because that's what I love to do and in the military if you had a spare time at all not infrequent was spent working on another cryptologic problem we're trying to breaking new code or something of that nature so I have had more free time that I really wanted from from my career I've never felt constrained by that my wife unfortunate would tell you a very different story about my lack of free time spend with her how ethnically diverse as your Stanfield I think it's important that everyone have an ability and the opportunity to participate in any kind of work in one displayed and I am very unhappy when I hear about anybody who feels like they have been given a fair chance but it is my belief from what I've been able to observe that almost every place I've been there have been some representatives of virtually every ethnic group every gender every or you know sexual orientation preference available to people if they wanted to take it but I would be misleading you if I didn't say there seems to be some ethnic groups who seem to excel in this kind of work and who you see more often than other areas and it's frequently in computers it's amazing how many of the people I see at a conference if you just look around are of Asian or a sub continent Indian descent because those two ethnic groups seem to produce very good computer scientist but you see somebody from every conceivable group so you know that it's available to people who want to pursue it the more difficult the joints as our mind as far as access into stem fields I think places I've worked had been very open to everybody in fact have tried to aggressively go out and recruit people from different ethnic groups and make sure the gender Max the gender say the question and is it more difficult to join stand as a female or as a minority I can only speak from my own experience but my own experience has been that every place I've worked it's been very open to anyone based on their ability to do the job that seems to be the only criterion the people look for if there's been any kind of variance from that has been the aggressive attempts to recruit people from different ethnic groups in from different gender is to make sure the gender balance is correct but I have seen I have never seen any kind of attempt to keep one group from doing this trip no one would is it is a more difficult joins them as a female or as a minority speaking from my own experience the ability for a female or a member of the minority to join he stem career he is completely done then unhampered in the United States I have worked in the military at work for businesses and I've worked in academia and I have never seen anyone suggest that they were restricting hiring somebody because of their sex gender ethnicity for any reason other than are they capable of doing the work so I think it's pretty wide open and there is even an aggressive attempt to try to achieve a better balance of ethnicity and gender within stem careers in both academia and industry what what characterizes a good career one of the things that I frequently hear people say is that this career would make you more money than that career but it's been my experience that all of us are going to make enough money to satisfy our needs and even our caprices so the most important thing in a career is to do something with the issue too Hayden series of topless once so you get some sense of self fulfillment I team and I get a job that was necessary I did it well we achieved our goals the team that I worked with were all satisfied with what we did so I think the most critical thing in pursuing a career is finding a career it's going to give you that feeling at the end there will be enough money to to live on and there will be enough to have a good life if you pursue that career goal that will give you that self fulfillment what don't you like about staff or your I like it all I've been in doubt of stem careers since I graduated from high school one way or the other that's a literal truth and I've really enjoyed all of the work I've done stem and I enjoy it still to this day did thing that I would really like to see the different about stem is I wish but government sometimes who is a little more responsive to supporting the stem research it will make a difference so frequently the government takes the approach of we need to pass a law and keep somebody from doing it rather than that we need to fund some research than we can encourage people to do the right thing rather than trying to force them to do the right thing why should so sometimes you still got your that's a good

Miscellaneous,,dandavis,What's your favorite joke?,I have the version do %HESITATION picking out a favorite of anything %HESITATION so let me give you a little better background well one of the things that's very common in the military is %HESITATION telling stories to each other and sometimes they involve telling a jokes that some comedian is come up with one kind or another but more often than not they are a humorous look at some activity in which everybody's participate %HESITATION so you get very good at being a storyteller in the military %HESITATION and you're a lot of jokes and they're sometimes when you have a sitting around to a club with everybody chipping in to buy the the picture you'll have kind of a little contest and everybody will say okay we're gonna tell a marine joke everybody in the table telemarketing joke and the first guy who can't come up with a new brain joke as to buy the next picture is able to come up with something in her is of course they're all variants on pick your favorite ethnic group Joe and just substitute the marine in the in this case %HESITATION rather than other ethnic groups that you've had a joke about so you get this kind of nonsense is all in good humor and and good fun but my favorite kinds of jokes have always been the short sequence like prostate Achaeans and my favorite along that line probably because I'm a researcher is the old joke that if you steal ideas from one man that's called plagiarism but if you steal ideas from a whole group of people that's cold research,What is the best joke you've heard?,Are you a comedian?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
