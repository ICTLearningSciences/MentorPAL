00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.560
So a normal work day for me will be making sure that I am checking the

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.280
 weather, checking everything that I need to know for my flight. making

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.990
 sure that my plane is up to date, making sure that maintenance is

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.710
 all clear and go and then we’ll take off, we’ll fly, we’ll land and

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.420
 then we'll debrief for about an hour and we'll go over everything

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.140
 every single step that we went over everything that I did and then I'll

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.850
 probably go home read a good book, pass out.
