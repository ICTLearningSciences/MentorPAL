00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:13.020
So let's say you go through the entire pipeline and you start flight school

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:25.180
 and you get there and everything's great and then you actually

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:37.350
 start flying and you're like you get vertigo and you get sick and you

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:49.520
 just realize this isn't for you you can ask to transfer and the navy

00:00:49.520 --> 00:01:01.680
 might put you on a ship or thet may use you in intel so the possibility

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:13.850
 of moving if you don't like it is there.
