00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.250
My biggest failure was probably not applying for a position that I really

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.650
 wanted to have and what I learned from it was that I should always

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.050
 apply to everything no matter what, like doesn't mean it doesn't

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.450
 matter if I don't get it, like as long as I applied for it I know that

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.850
 I don't ever have to hold that over myself again.
