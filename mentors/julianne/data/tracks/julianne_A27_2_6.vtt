A typical day in NROTC program at USC probably looks like waking up at

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.050
 Six AM to go and work out with all of your friends at ROTC and then

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.650
 going showering, changing into normal clothing, and heading to classes

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.250
 just like any other student. Sometimes we may have to go drill or

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.850
 may have to go to some leadership laboratories otherwise I am a normal

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.450
 student and I do normal things like go to club meetings, have other

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.050
 activities meet up with friends for lunch, may go play sports in

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.650
 the afternoon and go play some volleyball.  It's beautiful blend between

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.250
 being a normal college student and having the ROTC commitment.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.850
