Your commitment in the military starts when you start your second year

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.850
 of college.  So the day I started my sophomore year I signed a paper

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.850
 that said, “Yes I am willing to take up the military to take on this

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.850
 monetary fine of my college for me to serve a minimum of five years.”
