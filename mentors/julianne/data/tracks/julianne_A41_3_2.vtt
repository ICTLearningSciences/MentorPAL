You can apply for the Navy ROTC program if you just Google “Navy ROTC”

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:21.140
 and you'll be able to click on the first link and there's a whole application

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:31.280
 process.   I, if I had to give some insight tips I'd probably

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:41.420
 say that you should really consider being an engineer because the

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:51.560
 military is highly interested in hiring engineers.   I also think

00:00:51.560 --> 00:01:01.710
 that you should start it earlier rather than later because it's a rolling

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:11.850
 application so make sure you get on it right away.
