When I started going to Berkeley, I just barely started computer science. So, I was a noob. I was just a very new person with computer science and during the orientation, there's is this guy that's, you know, kind of, explaining what the campus is like, what life is going to be like, what you can expect from the liberal campus and I was sitting in the computer science group and to my left and right were two of my newest friends. To my left, there was a Java programmer, he'd been programming for eight years, he was an expert in this field, he'd, you know, made several programs and, like, he explained all of this to me and I'm like, ""Okay, we're going to be going to the same class, alright"" and to my right, there was somebody very very similar. He was, like, accepted to Stanford and he went to Berkeley because it's cheaper but, he had been programming since he was twelve, when he made his first computer, you know, like, blah blah blah and I was like, ""Okay, so this is the average people going to my university and we're going to be taking the, all right, I got some work for me to do."" So, that was what was on my plate when I first started going. For the military, I would say that something similar was going, I felt was going to happen. I joined the nuclear technology side of the Electrician's mate course and I had never liked engineering things at all, at all. I was the opposite. I liked driving my car but if you told me to change my oil, I would say, ""I don't think so. I'm going to take it in to Midas."" I don't like grease, I didn't like screw drivers. The biggest accomplishment I'd done, as far as, like, mechanical type things was, I had put shingles on a house and yeah, I was outside and yeah, you know, the air smelled fine but those mechanical type jobs, I just didn't feel at that time was for me. So, that's one of the reasons I actually joined the nuclear side of the Electrician's Mate. It's because, I actually wanted to challenge myself in that. I wanted to, kind of, see what that side was like, so.

I think I really grew from the experience because I was able to establish myself in a new place and totally on my own.,"A pivotal moment for me was the first time that I was accepted to UC Berkeley. Obviously it's a great school and anybody would be really proud to go there but until that time, I felt, even though I was in the nuclear navy and you're allowed to have a really good job at the end, I knew that that job, being a nuclear-trained operator in the civilian world or even as a navy person, that wasn't for me, so it's kind of, like, I had to start fresh, and I did. After the military, I decided to be a computer scientist and I wasn't the best computer scientist around but I did have the good work ethic and it was obvious that I was trying really hard but I didn't really have a strong sense of my own confidence until Berkeley said that they were accepting me. That's when I knew, ""Hey, you know what? There are people that have been trying their whole entire lives to try to get into this school. There are people with 4.0s, with perfect SAT scores that are trying to get into this school"" and for them to accept me, that's kind of, validation for me. I know going to university isn't validation, any type of university isn't validation but it's something that I was trying really hard to do and I was successful at it. So, I consider that maybe one of my first major successes. Being in the navy was one of them and getting the UC Berkeley acceptance was another one.",What moment changed your life?,What has been a life changing moment for you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Education, Advice",,juliannenordhagen,What is important when choosing a college?,"The things that are important in choosing which college you want to go to, are the programs that each college offers.
