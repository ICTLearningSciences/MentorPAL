00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.740
Something that I get asked pretty often about my job, being a nuclear

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.630
 technician is, "Wow, do you get to press the button?" and I'd always

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.520
 have to explain, "So, I'm an Electrician's Mate. As a nuclear technician,

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.410
 I don't really work with nuclear bombs." They get that confused.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.290
 I didn't know. In fact, when I joined the military, I thought I

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.180
 was going to be working on nuclear bombs but the nuclear technology

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.070
 field is something different. We work on the engines and so, the nuclear

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.960
 technology that we're working with has nothing to do with exploding

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.850
 at all.
