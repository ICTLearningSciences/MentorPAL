How much you study in college directly affects how well you do, unless

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.230
 you're a genius and unless this stuff really comes easy to you. Then

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.930
 you're supposed to put in the amount of effort that you're supposed

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.620
 to, right? For a four unit class, you're supposed to put in four hours

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.310
 for every unit that you take. So a four unit class means that's

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.000
 sixteen hours of work. An eight unit class is supposed to be thirty

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.700
 two hours of work, at least for graduate school. So in general, for

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.390
 undergraduate, you're supposed to put in, regardless of what your unit

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.080
 state, if you're a full time student, you're supposed to put in

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.770
 40 hours of standard work. Sometimes I did less, and my grades show

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.470
 that. Sometimes I did a lot more, and my grades still showed me that

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.160
 I was still an average student. But the point is that the more you

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.850
 work, the better you're supposed to do.
