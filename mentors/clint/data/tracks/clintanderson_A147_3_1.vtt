You don't have to be the best swimmer to join the military. That's a common

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.580
 question, it's like what, you're in the military and you can't

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.940
 swim? It's like yeah, so I learned to swim while I was in the navy,

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.300
 but when I first started I could barely doggy paddle. So the requirements

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.670
 for boot camp are you have to jump into some water and you can't

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.030
 hold on to anything, you have to be afloat for two minutes, and

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.400
 then you come back up. So if you don't know how to do that then there

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.760
 are some, there's a little bit of practice that you can do, and so

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.120
 basically everybody passes. If you definitely can't pass, then they

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.490
 have like specific training for you, but most of the time that's not

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.850
 a problem to pass, to just do two minutes.
