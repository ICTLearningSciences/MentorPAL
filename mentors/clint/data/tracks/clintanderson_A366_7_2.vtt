00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.430
Some of the biggest regrets that I have really revolve around my college

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.010
 career. So one of the biggest ones that's effecting me now is the

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.590
 fact that I don't know Japanese while I'm living in Japan. I remember

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.170
 being in my Japanese class and having all these conjee homework assignments

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.740
 and you know opening your book and reading and practicing

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.320
 and there was a time that I kinda just wanted to relax and enjoy my

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.900
 summer and I didn't practice and because I didn't practice during that

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.480
 intensive time with people who really wanted to see me succeed,

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.060
 who had all the tools, who had all the the toys and the stickers and

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.640
 everything that's helped me succeed, worksheets, and I just didn't

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.220
 do that and now I'm suffering for it. Now I can't communicate with the

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.800
 people around me. Another one is programming, there are so many opportunities

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.380
 to go talk to really smart people at Berkeley, who had

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.960
 the time and the knowledge and the care and the money to sit down and

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.530
 really give me that tutoring one on one session, but I didn't go to

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.110
 those things and now I'm suffering for it. Now I'm not the best computer

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.690
 science programer around because I didn't take advantage of those

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.270
 resources. There are others, but mainly it's that I didn't try

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.850
 harder the student
