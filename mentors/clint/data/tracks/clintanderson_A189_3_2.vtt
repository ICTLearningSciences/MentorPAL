00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.450
A story that really shows what it's like to be in the military, I have

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.050
 to say will be Oliver Stone's Full Metal Jacket. If you haven't watched

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.650
 it, go ahead and watch it because then you'll understand what boot

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.250
 camp is like, and the time that he had after the boot camp scene

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.850
 was during a war and it depends on when you're watching this whether

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.450
 you are in a war or not, but I think everything from the way that they

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.050
 talk to each other to the uniforms that they wear, to the jokes

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.650
 that they make, it's very very similar to how military people act.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.250
 So you should watch that movie and then you'll have a much better idea

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.850
 about what the Navy is like.
