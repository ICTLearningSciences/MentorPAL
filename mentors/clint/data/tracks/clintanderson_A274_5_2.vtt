00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.680
Being in the military can have a lot of advantages and disadvantages.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.520
 I really like supporting my country, I really like protecting the people

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.350
 around me, I like knowing that the job I was doing had a really,

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.180
 has a really big effect on the safety of America. However the job

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.020
 is pretty hard, and it has a high rate of people doing their job and

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.850
 then leaving after four years or six years or eight years. For me it

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.680
 was eight years. Being in the military you're gonna work harder than

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.520
 you've ever worked in your life. Your days are going to be in the

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.350
 morning until night, there's gonna be lots of training, there's going

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.180
 to be lots of cleaning, there's going to be lots of listening to

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.020
 people. You're gonna be dealing with people that you don't like, that

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.850
 you do like, there's going to be lots of studying that you're going

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.680
 to be doing that's going to make you pull your hair out. There's really

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.520
 great opportunities as well. You're gonna have some of the funnest

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.350
 times in your life, some of the meet some of the coolest people,

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.180
 and travel to some of the nicest places on earth. Taking all of it

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.020
 into consideration, I realize that the military isn't quite the job

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.850
 for me. There are many boring times, there many fun times, but I think

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.680
 that the job that is best suited for me is one that's fun all the

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.520
 time. So good on you if you wanted to join the military the whole

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.350
 entire time, if you one experience that and have a great career, have

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.180
 a good retirement plan, if you're satisfied with salary that you get

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.020
 and you have a happy family life. But for me I just wanted to experience

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.850
 something different and something maybe on a bigger scale.
