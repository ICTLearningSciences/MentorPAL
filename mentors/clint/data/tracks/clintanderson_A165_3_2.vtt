After you get done with your initial entrance processing for the military,

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.100
 then you're onward to boot camp. Boot camp is about three months,

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.730
 and they train you on simple things, tying knots, communicating with

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.350
 other people, how to do drill formations, things that you see in

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.970
 Full Metal Jacket. If you want to watch the first half of that movie

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.600
 then you understand what boot camp tries to be like. After that, then

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.230
 you're onward to your first vocational school, which is called A

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.850
 school. It ranges in size my school was six months, but it could be

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.470
 as short as two weeks. In general it's a couple months. After that

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.100
 time, then you're supposed to go off to your ship unless your in an

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.730
 advanced program like I was, in which case you'll go on to another school.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.350
 My next school was a nuclear power school for another six months,

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.970
 and then after that I had prototype training, which means that

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.600
 they sent me to a real prototype to train on the real thing with people

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.230
 watching me, of course and that was six months. Then I went to my

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.850
 ship.
