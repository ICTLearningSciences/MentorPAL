00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.730
During wartime, the tempo is a lot higher than it normally is. So, I fought

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.600
 in the Iraq war and then in the Afghanistan war and during those

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.470
 times we were in the middle of the ocean and days were pretty long

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.350
 from 6 AM to sometimes midnight very very often. We did so much training.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.230
 It was a very trying time but is also rewarding because your

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.100
 patience is tested, your drive and your motivation is tested and eventually

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.970
 you fight the war and you do a lot of good things. So, it actually

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.850
 works out.
