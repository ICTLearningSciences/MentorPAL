00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.980
When it comes to balancing your career, for instance, like I'm a computer

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.110
 science major right now but before I was in the military but in

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.240
 both cases, you always have to make sure that you have enough time,

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.370
 later on in your life, so that you don't disregard your earlier work.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.500
 Some people say, "Okay, well, I'm going to have a job that's so so,

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.630
 or that I don't like for eight hours of the day and then I'm going

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.760
 to, you know, suck that money and then use it for later on in life.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.890
 You know, I have a nice car and I have a nice house and then, you know,

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.020
 like, we go on vacation because of the sucky job that I had earlier

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.150
 and I don't think that that's a good balance. I think that you

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.280
 should really try to find a job that you would do for much much lower

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.420
 pay and that's the job that you can really do all day if you wanted

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.550
 to so you don't think of it as such a pain. It's not like you're,

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.680
 one hour before the time ends and you're like, "All right, let me go

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.810
 home, let me go home." If you're in that type of job, then I think

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.940
 you should start looking for another type of job and then if you do

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.070
 that, then balancing is really really easy. You can be either place,

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.200
 you can have, like, all day with family or you can be all day at work

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.330
 and both are okay with you. You know, it's not going to be like,

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.460
 in pain with either one of those. So, find a job that you love and make

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.590
 sure that your family life is cool too, your home life if you don't

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.720
 have a family is cool too and then there's no balance to be had.
