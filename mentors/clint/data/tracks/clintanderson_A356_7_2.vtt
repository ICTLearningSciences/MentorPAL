00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.140
One theme that I keep pushing is that you should really follow your passion

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.430
 and if you have a career that is following your passion that's

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.730
 fine. Not everybody can do that so chances are you can wind up in a

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.020
 job that you're very interested in, even though it's not your passion.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.310
 Maybe your passion is just your hobby. So the job that you have

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.600
 number one you want it to pay the right salary. If it's paying less

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.890
 than what you want then maybe you go in and maybe you're smiling every

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.180
 day, but I think you'll always have in the back of your mind, "maybe

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.470
 I can be doing something better." So if you can, try to like aim

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.770
 high, aim high for a good job, for the best job that you can be. Don't

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.060
 be you know the local department store clerk if you really want

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.350
 to be a NASA employee you know. I think there's going to be a disconnect

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.640
 that you might not be able to get over. Nothing against us those

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.930
 clerks. Another thing would be the people that are around you. So

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.230
 you can be in for instance a place with a cubicle and you can be doing

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.520
 quality work there. But if you're a very sociable person, and you

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.810
 want to be talking with people to help you and you want to help them,

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.100
 that cubicle might not be the best job for you even though it might

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.390
 be an interesting job that you like. So you have to realize the sociable

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.680
 aspect of it, the payment salary aspect of it, and the passion

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.970
 aspect of it. If you can find some kind of combination that all three

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.270
 fit, so that you come into work smiling, knowing that you have

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.560
 challenges ahead, knowing that you can be well promoted, then I think

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.850
 that that's the kind of job that we're all looking for.
