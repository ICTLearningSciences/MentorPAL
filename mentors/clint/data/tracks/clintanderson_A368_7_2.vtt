For me, seasickness wasn't really a big concern, because I was on a huge

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.650
 ship. It's an aircraft carrier, so unless you're doing really really

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.050
 fast movements when there are lots of waves, it really actually

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.450
 feels like you're in a building, most of the time. But I have been on

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.850
 a submarine, and those things are really small, smaller in comparison,

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.250
 and they go down and up and I think there's a big case of seasickness

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.650
 on those, on those places. Also, on the smaller ships, there's

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.050
 a lot of up and down movement, and I've seen a couple of people mention

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.450
 that, you know that they were feeling queasy. I've never seen

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.850
 anyone do the hurling thing.
