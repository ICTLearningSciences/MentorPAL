00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.020
College is great in so many ways and I have so many great memories. Some

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.200
 of my favorites are number one, I remember when I was in my introductory

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.370
 C++ class, we made this game where you start like four beads

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.550
 at the bottom and you have to like figure out the right ones by the

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.720
 time you get to the top. I remember I was really really into that game

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.890
 I was practicing day and night, I'd barely eat, you know eating

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.070
 pizza while programming. I was you know taking a break with my girlfriend

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.240
 watching a Netflix movie and then go back to that programming.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.420
 You know staying up till midnight you know she gets up in the in the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.590
 middle of the night like "Hey, are you still programming?" It's like

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.760
 yep, you know still going all the way up until the morning, really

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.940
 being challenged. And I remember thinking before I start this I had

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.110
 no idea what to do and by the end of it I felt like I really finished

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.280
 my first game and it was really exciting and I was really good at,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.460
 it was janky you know like there were lots of problems and lots of

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.630
 bugs you know bugs that I had to figure out. But it was my first quality

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.810
 work, it was the first homework assignment that I ever really

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.980
 completed that I was proud of that I could show someone that someone

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.150
 could actually play. That's something that came from me, you know.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.330
 So I think having that entire experience was one of my best college

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.500
 memories you know. Of course you know with my girlfriend like being

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.680
 there you know, bouncing off her so it was really good. Those times

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.850
 were really good.
