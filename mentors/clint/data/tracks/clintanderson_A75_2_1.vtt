Some of the common misconceptions about being in the Navy, well, the biggest

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.070
 one I hear is, well, "How often do you swim?" and I'd say, "I

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.180
 can't even swim" and they're like "What? You know, you're in the Navy!"

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.290
 Yeah, you know, it's not like you're in the middle of the ocean

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.410
 and then you jump over the edge and you know, like, have a swim call

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.520
 or anything. You don't, I didn't really touch the water so much. So,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.630
 the fact that you're on so many boats and you don't, you know, like

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.740
 touch the water at all for being in the Navy. That's a trip for a

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.850
 lot of people.
