The choice of college that you make is a really important decision in

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.410
 your life. Some people choose not to go to college and they have really

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.180
 great careers after that. Some people choose to go to a local community

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.960
 college, I went to a community college, a public university,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.740
 University of California at Berkeley, and a private university USC,

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.520
 University of Southern California, and I have to say, at all of three

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.290
 places the education is very very similar. So the difference was

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.070
 at community college, they really focused on my individual learning.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.850
 At UC Berkeley they really focus on research, and at USC it's just

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.630
 like UC Berkeley, however the class size is a lot smaller. So the best

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.410
 advice that I received was, "go to a place that there are people

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.180
 like you," and it really worked out well for me. I've gotten to enjoy

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.960
 all the experiences, some place are big, some places are small. So

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.740
 please go to the university check out the size, check out the feeling,

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.520
 get the atmosphere and wherever you feel happy, that's where you

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.290
 do the best, because your homework will see the difference and the

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.070
 friends that you make, your lifelong comrades you see them as well.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.850
 So go to the place that makes you happy.
