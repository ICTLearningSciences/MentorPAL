00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.390
In the Navy, you're exposed to some type of danger all the time. They

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.930
 range in risks. So, most of the time, you're at pretty low risk but

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.470
 it can range high. I know a friend of mine who was a Chief like I am

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.020
 now but I was a first class when this happened. He was opening up a

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.560
 load breaker and, I'm sorry he was opening a circuit breaker and he

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.100
 was trying to check the high voltage of it and because they thought

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.640
 that the machine was completely powered off, they took less protection

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.180
 than they should have and many people were shocked when they actually

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.730
 put the machine in a place that it wasn't supposed to go to and

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.270
 he eventually wound up in the hospital, you know, burns all over his

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.810
 body and I was exposed to things like that all the time. In fact,

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:07.350
 as an electrician, you always are. Not all the time, not as much as

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.890
 some of the higher level people are. If you are kind of new, they don't

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.430
 expect you to work with high level equipment all the time. But

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.970
 if you're, you know, first class or chief or senior chief or so forth,

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.520
 then they expect you to, kind of, go in there and, kind of, do the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.060
 test that you're supposed to. For me, personally I remember going

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.600
 into a breaker, that's where all of the, you know, the electricity and

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.140
 the current is, the high level voltage is and when I checked, it

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.680
 wasn't completely powered off. We didn't realize that at the time. So,

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.230
 if I would have touched the wrong thing at the wrong time, then it

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.770
 could have been an incident. However, we corrected the problem and

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.310
 there wasn't really any big danger to me. Things like that are bound

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.850
 to happen to many people because accidents happen.
