For me, personally, joining the military was one of the best things that

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.680
 I could've done. You will work really hard and once you get out and

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.100
 you become a civilian, you realize that what you did was protect

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.520
 the nation. You protected the people around you, the civilians and you

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.930
 can kind of see, even the job that you'll start to have and the jobs

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.350
 that they've always had, you had a large part in making that possible.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.770
 So, I think it was worth it for the pride that you get for serving

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.180
 your country and the skills that you obtain because I didn't have

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.600
 any of those skills before but from that point on, I had my education

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.020
 paid for and I had a valuable job that, if I ever wanted to, I

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.430
 could flip a coin and then have a really high paying job. So, it was

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.850
 definitely worth it.
