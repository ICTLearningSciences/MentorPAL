00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.180
When you are in the military, they kind of expect to get the biggest burden

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.520
 from you when you first join. Because you, you come in as a fresh

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.850
 civilian who's been on you know, on land the whole time so when

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.180
 you first get there, you're expected generally to go on a ship for your

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.520
 first command. You do that for about four years and that should

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.850
 be the end of most people's, of many people's careers. So then they

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.180
 go off and become civilians again. So they just do one sea tour. However

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.520
 if you're going to stay in longer, at that time, then they want

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.850
 to give you a break from so much sea time. Sea time can be difficult.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.180
 So then they probably send you to shore command for two or three

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.520
 years. After that, then you have this cycle. About three or four years

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.850
 on sea duty, two or three years shore, three or four years sea, two

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.180
 or three shore. And then you're probably going to finally end up

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.520
 with four more years or three more years of sea duty and then that's

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.850
 your twenty years. If you stay in longer, then they'll probably shorten

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.180
 your sea command a bit, because you're a little bit older, you're

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.520
 a little bit wiser and sea is for, sea is for those young, those

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.850
 young bucks.
