If you wanted to get in good with your bosses or your chiefs or your senior

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.200
 chiefs, or if you're an officer, the superior officers, number

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.380
 one it would be good to have a good personality. Now everybody hates

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.560
 the fact that you know jobs like the military, pretty much any job

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.730
 is political. But that is, nobody likes to work around people that

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.910
 they don't like. If you're an introvert, it would be good for your career

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.090
 if you can kinda like express yourself a little bit you know,

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.260
 kind of be friends with the person that's working beside you. You know

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.440
 you might watch a lot of military movies and see guns, see people

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.610
 fighting and shooting, and you know like eventually you can see that

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.790
 they become a band of brothers you know even if they're girls but

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.970
 band of brothers right, that's the saying. And if you can try to you

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.140
 know live up to that movie stereotype, then that would work very well

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.320
 with your superiors because the key word, the only word that really

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.500
 matters for the military is teamwork, and the more that you can show

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.670
 that you're a team, the more that you can like relate to your peers,

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.850
 then that would look really good with your superiors.
