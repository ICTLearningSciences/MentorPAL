00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.850
For my navy career, I learned a lot of stuff doing six weeks of intensive

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.850
 electrical training, you learn about motors and shunts and shorts

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.850
 and opens and switches and valves and thousands of other things. You

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.850
 don't really see much of it when you're in your job. You know about

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.850
 it, you've heard about it, if it ever comes up in a problem or a

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:36.850
 technical class then you'll be familiar with it, but you don't really

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.850
 see it, and there's a good reason for that. It's because we do so

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.850
 much preventive maintenance on our equipment that the times that we

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.850
 have problems are few and far between. Yes we do have problems but they're

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 not as complex as you might see in the books that you learn.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.850
 That's our job though. Our job is to take on as much information as

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.850
 we can and have the access to the tools, we have access to like the

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.850
 books and the procedures that are required to fix the problem when we

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.850
 hear about it. Knowing about it is a lot different then actually working

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.850
 with it every single day. So as long as you've heard it then

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.850
 it's good enough.
