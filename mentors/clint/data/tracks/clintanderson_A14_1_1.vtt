00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.280
Besides Los Angeles, I've lived all up and down the coast of California.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.710
 So, I grew up in Los Angeles that's where I graduated from high school

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.140
 at and then after I did my 8 year tour in the Navy, I went to

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.560
 college in the San Francisco area. My college was Berkeley which is

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.990
 right across the bay. During my Navy stint, they sent me to San Diego.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.420
 So I've had maybe two or three years in all of those cities. Those

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.850
 are the major cities of California.
