00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.020
So, if you're in the Navy and you find out that you don't like the job

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.180
 that you're doing, the best thing I can say is, at least for a short

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.350
 amount of time, you have to suck it up. I know some people who didn't

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.520
 want to be Machinist's Mates but they were given an option of like

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.680
 three or four jobs, they chose something else and then they were

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.850
 given that Machinist's Mate job anyways. So, at the end of four years,

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.020
 and you have to do your four years, they lived that life, they learned

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.180
 those things, they did that training, they did that job and at

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.350
 the end, then they left and did something else for the civilians. You

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.520
 can't really change your job after you have decided to do it. So,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.680
 me, I've been an Electrician's Mate this whole entire time and there

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.850
 are very very few opportunities that I could actually change. I could've

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.020
 been an officer and then my lifestyle would have changed or I

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.180
 could have chosen my command later on in my career. That would have

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.350
 changed my lifestyle but it wouldn't have actually changed my job itself.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.520
 So, I guess one big suggestion is make sure that the job that

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.680
 you're getting yourself involved in, is something that you think you

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.850
 could really do and have fun with.
