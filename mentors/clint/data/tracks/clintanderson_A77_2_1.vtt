00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.140
The Navy is very different than what I expected when I joined. I didn't

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.430
 really know that much about the military. My father was in the army

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.730
 and I should have had a better clue than what I did but I never, you

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.020
 know, I barely visited when he was in the army. He just came home

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.310
 and then, you know, took care of us. So, I had that same understanding

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.600
 that most people think about when they hear about them, the military,

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.890
 that is, that you're going to put on the hat, you're going to

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.180
 wear these clothes,you're going to, you know, go to foreign countries

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.470
 and fight wars. So, I did fight wars but I never really visited the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.770
 country itself. My war was on a ship itself, on an aircraft owned

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.060
 by America. So, I didn't ever go to Iraq, I didn't ever go into Iran,

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.350
 I didn't ever go to Saudi Arabia. I didn't go to those places but

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.640
 I still fought the war, so that's kind of different than what I was

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.930
 expecting. I also bought into the mentality that everyday is going to

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.230
 be like P.T, physical training, good for you, good for me, but you

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.520
 barely work out. You are supposed to keep in shape. So, if you get

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.810
 overweight, then, you know, that could be a problem but for the Navy

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.100
 at least, as long as you meet the standards in the training which happens

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.390
 every six months, they make sure that you're not overweight,

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.680
 that you can do some push-ups and some sit-ups, then you're good to

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.970
 go and some people actually, they kind of skate around the system. So,

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.270
 people are a lot less fit than what I thought I would be doing. I

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.560
 thought I'd be like super buff, you know, model style but it's, that's

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.850
 not really expected of you.
