00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.420
Many of my math classes, I took them all right up through difference equations,

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.990
 and I'm glad that I took all of those classes, differential

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.560
 equations like wrapped everything up. It's like ah this is what we've

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.140
 been studying our whole entire lives since elementary school for,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.710
 I finally get it. But I haven't used any of it at all. Yes you have

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.280
 to know a little bit of chemistry when you see like the nuclear power

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.850
 gauge like move up and down and stuff. You kind of know like where

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.420
 the calculus is in that, but I I never use it I just know it's there

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.990
 and all that effort just to understand why a gauge like moves up

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.560
 and down like acceleration and stuff like it's, yeah there are other

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.140
 things I could have learned to help me you know. But math but I'm

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.710
 not gonna tell kids not to learn math so. But I never used it, you're

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.280
 never gonna use it yeah. You might use it sometimes you know, not

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.850
 all this stuff you're gonna learn.
