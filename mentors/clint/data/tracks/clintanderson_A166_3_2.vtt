00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.520
Boot camp is the initial training that all military members go through.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.180
 So you go to this place near the Chicago area and they put you in

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.850
 a division, it's about maybe thirty people or so. It's very very strict

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.520
 there. Everybody's in bunk beds and be teach you how to make your

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.180
 bed, but it's in a very special way. All the creases have to be aligned

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.850
 perfectly, all of the sheets have to be super clean and facing

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.520
 the same way. So it's not, when they teach you to make this bed, it's

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.180
 not the fact that they want you to make a bed this way, it's the

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.850
 fact that they're looking to make sure that you can follow directions.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.520
 They give you a list of steps and they make sure that number one

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.180
 you don't talk back to them, number two that you do it at the time that

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.850
 it is supposed to be done, at six o'clock or at five o'clock in

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.520
 the morning, with you standing outside of your bed with it already been

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.180
 made. They make sure that there's nothing on the bed or inside the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.850
 bed, or that it's all made the same way. So there's a lot that goes

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.520
 into making this bed. So I'm mentioning this bed part because everything

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.180
 about boot camp is the exact same way, from the books that you

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.850
 train on, to the knots that you're making, to the way that you do

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.520
 your drills. It's not that they're trying to teach you these things,

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.180
 they are but they're actually filtering out who has no problem with

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.850
 following directions and who needs a little bit more time to train

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.520
 in these things, and for some reason like let's say you come from a

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.180
 bad neighborhood, you don't like being talked to and yelled at, those

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.850
 are people that would have problems if they go out into the real

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.520
 service. So they take those people to the side, maybe they're in boot

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.180
 camp for a little bit longer or maybe they actually get kicked out

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.850
 of boot camp. But by the time you get done with your three months or

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.520
 four months of boot camp, you should have a good idea of what discipline

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.180
 is like, and how to follow directions from the simplest of tasks

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.850
 to the more complex tasks.
