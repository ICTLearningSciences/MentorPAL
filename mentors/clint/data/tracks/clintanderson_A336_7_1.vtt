Balancing military work and school is challenging, but it can be done.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.620
 I was on active duty for eight years, and during that time there wasn't

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.000
 that much opportunity to be a full time student. I did take part

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.390
 time classes during work, but sometimes work was really long, especially

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.770
 when we were fighting the war. So I took one class each semester

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.160
 for over two breaks in the summer, and they were really good, they

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.540
 were really fun, and I got A's in both classes. It was English and

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.930
 calculus, and you find little spots in your day to fill it in.  When

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.310
 I got out of the active duty service, I was a full time student,

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.700
 and I was doing Navy part time as a reservist, and then it's much more

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.080
 manageable. Reserve work is only Saturday and Sunday, otherwise they

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.470
 don't really, they give you lots of freedom to you know, really

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.850
 focus on your schoolwork. So reserve is a lot easier for that.
