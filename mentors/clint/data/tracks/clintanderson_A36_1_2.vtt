00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.620
So, for all the benefits that the military job provides you, you can also

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.390
 have a lot of frustration with the job. For most people, I think

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.160
 this might be the hardest that you'll ever work in your life. That's

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.930
 how come the military has young people do it and then, once they leave,

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.700
 they go on to productive careers but they'll always say, "You

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.470
 know what, I can do anything because I worked so hard for the military."

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.230
 Along with those long working hours, you're away from your family.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.000
 That's a part of, having those long working hours. So, for instance,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.770
 deployment is probably everyone's major reason for getting out.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.540
 They want to see their kid grow up, they want to spend more time with

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.310
 their wife, they want to actually date and have a social life. So

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.080
 these are things that you have to give up by joining the military.
