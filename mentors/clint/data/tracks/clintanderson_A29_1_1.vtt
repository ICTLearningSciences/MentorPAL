The amount of hours that you work in a typical day actually depend on

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.230
 whether you're deployed or not. So, if you're deployed fighting the

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.410
 war, then I'd say 12 hours would probably be the average. On some days

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.600
 you get away with working only eight, that's including Saturdays.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.790
 Many days, in fact every four days, you're working for a day and a

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.970
 half. So, you stand your eight hours of normal work and then you have

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.160
 your General Quarters, which is actually training at night time for

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.350
 two or three or four hours and then you could have another watch from

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.540
 midnight until six the next day and you could possibly have your

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.730
 normal work day tacked on the end of that. So, you know, some days,

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.910
 if you're really in it, you're working, you know, a day and a half

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.100
 to two. Sundays were my easiest days where I'd only work for six hours

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.290
 and that's like a great day for me. When you are not deployed, then

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.470
 days are a lot easier. You probably get to work around seven and

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.660
 then you leave around noon so that means your days are only five hours

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.850
 or six hours.
