00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.010
So, the type of student that I was in college, in high school and in elementary

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.170
 school, it varied. It was kind of like a sine wave. So, when

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.320
 I was in elementary school, I always took tests and they always said

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.480
 that I was like very very high achieving or something like that.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.640
 I always scored really high on my IQs, so I got the impression that

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.800
 I was a really bright kid. In high school, it kind of dipped down.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.960
 I was a little bit more independent. I stopped doing my homework. I

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.110
 stopped listening to teachers. I started hanging out with friends a

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.270
 lot more. So, my 4.0s and 3.8s started going down to you know, very

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.430
 very low. That's one of the reason that I didn't go to college right

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.590
 away. I think many people in the nuclear field like I'm in had a very

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.740
 similar story. I'd say more than half the people had that story.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.900
 They were bright as kids but they kind of somehow lost their way, ended

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.060
 up going to community college and then going to the military or

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.220
 some other situation. So, going through the military actually helped

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.380
 me out a lot because it taught me a lot of self discipline, a lot of

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.530
 reasons to get motivated to study a lot. So, after I finished my active

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.690
 duty Navy career, I went back to college and I was on par. I started

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.850
 doing well with the smarts that I was given.
