00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.780
There's a big difference between undergraduate and graduate schools. Undergraduate

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.720
 school is where you get your basic theory about your main

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.650
 topic, your main major. So for instance, if I'm computer science,

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.580
 then they're going to give me a broad general spectrum of what computer

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.520
 science is. Your graduate school, it depends on whether you go

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.450
 to masters or PhD.  Masters' courses, they vary. I'm in a masters course

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.380
 that has only classes and it doesn't have any research oriented

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.320
 work. However, most masters students are, they have some kind of strong

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.250
 research element, component to them, that's as opposed to undergraduate

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.180
 school. PhD is strictly and specifically for doing research.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.120
  So, at the bottom you have, not bottom, but at the lower end of the

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.050
 spectrum, you have undergraduate where you get your basic theory,

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.980
 you have your master's which can be on the path to a PhD or it can

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.920
 be vocational, and you have your PhD which is very academic and strictly

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.850
 for research.
