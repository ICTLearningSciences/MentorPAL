00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.730
When I joined, I had a couple of opportunities in front of me. I think

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.620
 I originally wanted to be a crypto tech but the nuclear field was very

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.500
 very exciting. They said that I had a good opportunity to go to

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.390
 the Naval Academy, they said that I'd learn physics and chemistry and

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.270
 thermodynamics and nuclear power, you know, very very well, they said

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.160
 that it's an advanced field and people out there in the civilian

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.040
 world know it. So, they gave all of these positives to join the nuclear

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.930
 field and I got to admit, that actually overshadowed any other

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.810
 job that I wanted to pursue. In A school, you learn, basically graduate

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.700
 level nuclear work, nuclear studies. So, I'd been in college and

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.580
 I went to master's courses and I got to admit, the military is actually

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.470
 more intense than college, than any college that I'd been to. They

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.350
 work you for eight hours per day, they give you lots of tests and

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.230
 it's simple, they always say that nuclear field is as hard as a pre-calc

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.120
 or I'm sorry, a pre-algebra class and that's actually true. Everything

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.000
 is written down for you in easy to read explanations and so

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.890
 if you could read normally as a high school student, for instance,

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.770
 if you got As and Bs and maybe even Cs in high school, then this learning

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.660
 is no problem for you. The difference is, you have to be willing

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.540
 to do it for a long time and if you start lacking, then you need

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.430
 to start doing all the homework that they tell you to do. They're not

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.310
 going to let you fail. The difference is, everybody that goes through

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.200
 this training, by the end, for the nuclear field at least, they

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.080
 know exactly what you're going to do, how to do the nuclear training

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.970
 that they've been shown and if you can't, then you have to do something

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.850
 else. So, there is no opportunity for failure.
