00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.680
So, the nuclear question. What experience do I have with nuclear bombs?

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.520
 I don't have any idea what they are. I know kind of, what goes inside

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.350
 them because my job particularly deals with nuclear things but the

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.180
 nuclear technology that's used to power an aircraft to go through

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.020
 the water is very different from the nuclear reaction that goes on

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.850
 inside a nuclear bomb. Now that's not to say that some people don't.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.680
 I was on an aircraft carrier, which means that there are no nukes on

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.520
 an aircraft carrier. However, other nuclear technicians, they go on

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.350
 submarines. Now, we have ballistic submarines, so they're walking

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.180
 right beside those nuclear bombs. We call them tridents or yeah yeah,

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.020
 I don't know anything about the submarine force, you have to ask them.
