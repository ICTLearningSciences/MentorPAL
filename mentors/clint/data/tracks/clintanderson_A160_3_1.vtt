00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.450
For me the living quarters in the navy are outstanding. A lot of people

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.050
 that join they think well it is my first place that I've been staying

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.650
 you know. So like no matter what it is, they'll have a lot of complaints

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.250
 but I realize, I grew up in Flint, Michigan you know, so the

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.850
 fact that they gave me a nice clean bed with clean furniture and a

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.450
 desk right there you know, and that's all they give, and a closet you

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.050
 know. It looks like a tiny little hotel you know, like kind of a

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.650
 cheap hotel, but for me that's you know and the fact that it's free

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.250
 like really blew my mind away. So the other place that you can stay

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.850
 at, for instance the Navy Gateway Inn, or the Navy lodge, they're some

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.450
 of the highest quality hotels that you can find. For instance I was

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.050
 in Hawaii a couple of years ago and I stayed at like this expensive

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.650
 like $300 hotel, and it was nice you know there's a bed, king size

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.250
 bed and you know. But then you stay at the Navy lodge down the street

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.850
 and it's like a huge room with nice fans and there's like, the bedroom

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.450
 has its own door. The bathroom is like you can swim in it, you

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.050
 know you go outside and there's like three couches and there's like

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.650
 TVs for every room, it's crazy. It has its own separate kitchen so

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.250
 like they realize that you know the military people that are traveling

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.850
 across the country, they need a nice place to stay. So it's some

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.450
 of the best places that I've stayed at. Now the place that the military

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.050
 provides for the sailors, it's very quaint. But those places that

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.650
 you go on for vacation, or the places that the Admirals stay at,

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.250
 or the places that you have to pay for that's not, that isn't for official

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.850
 work, they're some of the nicest in America.
