00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.770
There are two different major career paths that I chose. One is the military,

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.700
 and I'm still in the military because I'm in the reserves, and

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.620
 one is computer science. With the military, they provide so much

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.540
 training for you. In fact, even though some of the us are pushing it

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.470
 away, they provide you with training here and there, it's really required

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.390
 if you want to progress in your career. So they give you books

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.310
 that you can read, we have online video tutorials all the time. When

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.230
 you're at work people come up to you and they provide you training

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.160
 over and over and over. So it's pretty much handed to you on a plate.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.080
 That's in contrast with my computer science career, where I don't

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.000
 have a main supervisor. And if I do have a main supervisor, he's not

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.930
 providing me with required material to learn. So basically it's hands

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.850
 on learning, it's manual learning, it's learning on your own at

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.770
 your own free pace. So both of those ways I found are really comfortable.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.700
 I like the online video tutorials and the instant training that

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.620
 I get from the military because it's so easy and it's very very clear

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.540
 what I am supposed to learn. With computer science I have a wide

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.470
 range of things that I can learn, and it basically is going to dictate

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.390
 what I can do for my future careers. So if I wanna learn python,

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.310
 then while I'm whittling down that path then I can become a Google

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.230
 web developer because they use python a lot. However if I say well

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.160
 python is too easy I wanna learn something a little bit more complex

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.080
 and I learn Perl. Well not many people use, many people use Perl but

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.000
 it's a different style of programming and those jobs can hire me,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.930
 so I can learn at my own pace. I think both of those have been really

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.850
 interesting and really fun and enjoyable for me.
