Most people in the Navy they have their own cell phone, they have their

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.720
 own laptop. However, there are lots of restrictions in place that

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.650
 say that you can't really use them outside of the living spaces. So

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.580
 you can use it in your bed, you can use it on the table right outside

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.520
 your bed in the adjacent area, but otherwise you're not allowed to

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.450
 use them so much. One of the reasons is that they have cameras on them

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.380
 and cameras aren't really allowed on the ship. They don't want you

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.320
 taking pictures of sensitive equipment, and in many cases you'll

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.250
 put it in your pocket and if you go down to the plants where there's

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.180
 lots of sensitive equipment, then you could get in a lot of trouble

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.120
 for that. If they think that you took any picture of any classified

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.050
 equipment, then they're going to take your camera, and it's probably

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.980
 not gonna get back to you for a long time, if ever. But otherwise

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.920
 don't be scared. Bring your laptop, bring your cell phone, you can take

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.850
 pictures of you know normal stuff, but that's about it.
