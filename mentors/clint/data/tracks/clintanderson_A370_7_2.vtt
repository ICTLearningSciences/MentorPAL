00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.760
For me personally, because I'm not really, I've never been so much of

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.670
 a family person. I never miss my family, the family that I did have,

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.580
 because I was too independent. However, I did find myself, being in

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.490
 the middle of the ocean, after two or three months, just wanting to

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.400
 come home and experience day to day things. Daily life. I wanted to

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.300
 watch movies, I wanted to drive my car around. I wanted to go to the

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.210
 mall and meet girls and experience life. The life of a young twenty

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.120
 year old. And when you're out to sea, you really don't have those

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.030
 opportunities. So that's my version of being homesick. Just wanting

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.940
 things that you probably think are very normal. Those things are like

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.850
 gold to me when you are out on deployment.
