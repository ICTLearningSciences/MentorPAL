So, job security is one of the military's major major positives. You're

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.710
 not going to get fired unless you really do something bad and even

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.140
 if you do something bad, as long as it's not, you know, like, short

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.560
 of murder, then you're still going to be there, you're still going

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.990
 to, you might be reduced a rank or two, sometimes I've even seen three,

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.420
 but they will keep you and as long as you have the motivation to

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.850
 get yourself back, then you will always have a job.
