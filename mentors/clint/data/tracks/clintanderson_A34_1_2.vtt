So, when you do this type of work, you get a lot of benefits. When I joined,

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.850
 I think I was working at McDonald's and Swap Meet. Maybe the

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.850
 movie theater too, I think I was working two or three jobs at, you know,

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.850
 all around the year and I didn't have any type of direction. I

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 knew I was smart but I just didn't have enough time to, you know, pay

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.850
 my bills at the time. So, I joined the military and one of their promises,

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.850
 they said that you could have a really high paying job at the

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.850
 end of your career. You know, it's a six year contract. So, I said,

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.850
 "Okay, well I have these skills". They taught me math, they taught

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 me physics, thermodynamics, chemistry and by the end of my six year

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.850
 tour, I had enough knowledge to basically become Homer Simpson. I

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.850
 could go out there and work at a nuclear power plant, full of confidence.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.850
 So, they give you the skills that you need to get a really high

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.850
 paying job or a different job. You know, depends on what you want

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 to do.
