If you think you're not smart enough to go to college, then that's a full

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.520
 stop. There's a college for everyone. If you want to go to college,

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.850
 if you think that that's the path that you want to take, then there

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.180
 are community colleges that can help you get on that path, that

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.520
 can help you learn how to study how to do homework and they're not so

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.850
 expensive. There are state colleges that have different programs,

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.180
 certificates, degrees. So yeah there's a place for you at some college.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.520
 You might not have the grades, the SAT scores, the GPA, the study

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.850
 habits to be successful at a very difficult college, but there are

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.180
 colleges out there that can put you on the right path, or easy colleges

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.520
 that you can kind of just breeze through if you really do need

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.850
 a degree for some reason.
