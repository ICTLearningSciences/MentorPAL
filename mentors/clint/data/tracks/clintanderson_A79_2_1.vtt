00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.430
My view's changed for the military and a couple of ways. The first way

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.010
 is, that I understand the different roles of the military now. Before,

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.590
 I just thought we were just one big group, you go fight a war and

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.170
 I didn't know who did what but now, I see where we stand globally

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.740
 as far as, like, what branches do what service. Aircraft people, they

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.320
 stay pretty much on United States soil and then they send huge ships

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.900
 to do logistics. Marines, they're the ones who keep in really good

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.480
 shape so that they can go and get that first push when we start the

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.060
 war, when we start a battle. We have the Army people who like, provide

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.640
 support to the Marines and they fight themselves too, you know,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.220
 but they're the ones like, shooting guns and stuff. So, like, you start

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.800
 to learn all of these things and later on, as a supervisor, you

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.380
 get more information about why we are doing things. So, for instance,

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.960
 why we're fighting in Iraq, why we are sending these planes over

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.530
 there and how the aircraft carrier can support them as opposed to like,

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.110
 when you're, you know, fresh on this ship, like, I don't know, I'm

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.690
 just here on this boat. I'm supposed to fix that pump, that's all

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.270
 I know. So, you get more knowledgeable about things the longer you've

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.850
 been in.
