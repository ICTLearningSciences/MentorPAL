00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.910
I had a great opportunity to know most of my family throughout my lifetime.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.970
 My parents were divorced, so that means that I spent sometime

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.030
 with my mother's family, sometime with my father's family, sometime

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.090
 with my father's mother and sometimes with my mother's mother. So, I

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.140
 bounced around from household to household when I was a youth. I didn't

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.200
 really form any strong bonds with anyone but I did get an opportunity

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.260
 to see most of the world so I spent a couple years with my grandmother

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.320
 in Alabama. So, I got to shoot a few guns there and got to

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.380
 climb mountains and do all of that country stuff that, you know, a

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.440
 lot of people come into the Navy with. I just also lived in Michigan

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.500
 and it's kind of an impoverished area, if you have been watching movies

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.560
 and things, you probably know about this but it's developed my

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.610
 character in a lot of ways. Eventually, I finally moved to California

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.670
 and I have to say, out of all the places that I've been, which is

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.730
 all over America, California is the right place to be. It has a temperature

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.790
 that I want, the people and the diversity I want. So, maybe

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.850
 from now on I'll always stay in California.
