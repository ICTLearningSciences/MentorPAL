00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.270
I got into archery based on the fact that I was kind of a geek when I

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.680
 was growing up. I used to play Dungeons and Dragons and you know that

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.100
 they're like these warriors and elves and my favorite character was

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.520
 like, a ranger, so he always had his little helper friend, you know,

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.930
 like kind of pet and he'd always go shoot things, so. I grew up in

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.350
 Alabama and we used to shoot guns a lot too, and the fact that I was

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.770
 into that kind of a game and the fact that I used to shoot guys myself

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.180
 really got me into like, long distance kind of sports. So, I got

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.600
 my two expert, my marksman and my sharp shooter qualifications and

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.020
 because I'm really good with my eyes, you know, that got me into archery

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.430
 because it's a lot easier to do here rather than shooting guns.
