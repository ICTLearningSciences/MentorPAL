Some of the crimes that people commit when they're in the military almost

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 always deal with drinking. So for instance, let's say there's a

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.850
 robbery, chances are there's alcohol involved. If there's a crash, there's

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 probably alcohol involved. If there is a fight, chances are there

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.850
 is alcohol involved. So I say that the common crime is drinking

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.850
 alcohol, but that's not a crime in itself. The other things are kind

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 of collateral damage, so yeah if you're on a ship for a year, then

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 you will see that somebody has robbed, one person on the ship has robbed

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.850
 somebody out there in the world, you will hear about four fights,

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.850
 five fights that got people demoted, and you will hear about three

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.850
 drunk driving's. Maybe there was no crash but they just got caught

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 for it. So those are the common crimes that I see committed.
