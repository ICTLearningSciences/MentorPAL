00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.900
So, with the Navy, they always give you training. That's something that's

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.950
 going to be ingrained in your heart by the end of your Navy tour.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.000
 So, the ways that they train you is that they have one of the people

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.050
 in your unit go up and provide something from a book that you probably

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.100
 learn in A school, that you probably learn on the job. So, for

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.150
 instance, the diagram of the reactor and we're supposed to know, for

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.200
 instance, all the valves that are there, we're supposed to know what

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.250
 to do in case of a casualty. For instance, if there's a fire in one

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.300
 of the pumps, we have to say, "Well, you're supposed to turn off

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.350
 valve A, B and C", and then call it in and then we'll tell the watch

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.400
 officer and then ask somebody to help and then go back and fight the

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.450
 fire. What happens if there is like, a radiation spill? Are you supposed

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.500
 to, you know, do these things? So, for instance, every time that

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.550
 you have a casualty, which means that there is a problem in the

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.600
 ship, be it a fire, a flood, a scram of the reactor, which means it

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.650
 breaks down, then you have to know what each of those steps are. And

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.700
 after being in the Navy for what, a year let's say, if you don't train

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.750
 about it, then you're going to forget it. So, they allow a little

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.800
 bit of forget and then they train on it so you remember it. Then,

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.850
 you have that cycle of training over and over and over.
