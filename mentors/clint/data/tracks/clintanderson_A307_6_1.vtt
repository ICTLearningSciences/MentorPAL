00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.350
For me there's not one best career that you can go into, I think even

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.850
 for me I had many opportunities that were available to me, I could of

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.350
 went into music I could of went into art, I chose engineering because

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.850
 I like the challenge I like to challenge myself to figure out things

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.350
 that I've never figured out before and to try to I don't know,

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.850
 ha, get the most money that I can with the amount of intelligence that

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.350
 I have. But really, you should, you should have your future salary

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.850
 in mind you shouldn't just push that under the rug but it should be

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.350
 a balance between the passion that you have for what you want to do

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.850
 because that will help you be promoted and that'll help you enjoy

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.350
 every single day, you know, for the things you're doing until the time

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.850
 that you retire and salary and you have to have the passion you know

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.350
 you have to have those two balanced to have a good quality job.
