00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.040
I'm always learning new skills. My current job as an English teacher in

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.230
 Japan has me making lesson plans and building my self-confidence.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.410
 So, what I mean is, I'm in front of thirty other kids and I had never

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.600
 been a teacher before, so it's really interesting to have on your

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.790
 mind that each of these kids has to learn a certain thing. So, before

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.970
 I have to make some kind of activity that teaches them some simple

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.160
 English words, then I have to distribute that to them, to unbright

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.350
 kids to really geniuses that already know English and everyone in between

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.540
 and make sure that I'm doing a good effort. During that, I have

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.730
 to sound confident. I learned lots of self-confidence being a Chief

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.910
 in the military because I talked to thirty people all the time. Not

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.100
 teaching them, well I teach them sometimes but not one hour of strong

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.290
 teaching of the military things. It's just, kind of, explain to

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.470
 them what to do and supervising them but teaching kids is a little bit

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.660
 different. So, the confidence that I learned and teaching ability

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.850
 that I learned are the two newest skills that I learned.
