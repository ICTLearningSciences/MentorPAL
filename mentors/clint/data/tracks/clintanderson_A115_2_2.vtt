The Naval Postgraduate School is basically the Navy's main school for

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.050
 officers who probably came from the Naval Academy or maybe ROTC, that

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.650
 are advanced in their career enough maybe after four years or six

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.250
 years, to go back to graduate school to getÂ an advanced degre. So they

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.850
 allow Master's courses and things from security to operations management,

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.450
 basically lots of war things. I was thinking about going there

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.050
 myself to get a degree in modeling virtual environments and simulation,

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.650
 it's a computer science field but there are things like applied

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.250
 math, things that keep our Navy in tip top shape for the people

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.850
 that are really controlling things at that level.
