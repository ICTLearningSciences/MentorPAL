Just like with any other job, the military has lots of different personalities.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.160
 And I have my own unique personality and sometimes I can be

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.310
 very antisocial. Of course you're gonna work with some people that

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.470
 you don't want to be around and in those cases, what I found myself

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.620
 doing is, you know of course you try to talk with them, you try to

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.770
 be friendly. But if you're just butting heads, you kinda keep your mouth

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.930
 shut. You just sit there, you stay off in your own world. It's

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.080
 better to, especially when you're around expensive equipment, to not

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.230
 be so talkative and perform your work rather than getting in an argument

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.390
 and then having to be on the watch with this person for the next

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.540
 five years (who you're arguing with) you don't want that to happen.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.700
  Just stay in your own world when you find people that you don't

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.850
 get along with so much.
