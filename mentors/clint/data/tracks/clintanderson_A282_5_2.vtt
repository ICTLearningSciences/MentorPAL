00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.600
You should not join the Navy if you know yourself as a person number one

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.350
 doesn't get along with people, number two can't follow directions.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.100
 You're kind of setting yourself up for failure in a big way if you

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.850
 join the military knowing that for instance you do drugs. That's a

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.600
 sure fire way to get kicked out and then you're going to have that stigma

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.350
 against you for the rest of your life. People are going to ask

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.100
 you, have you ever been in the service? And if so, were you kicked

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.850
 out? And if you mark yes that you were kicked out, then that could be

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.600
 a bar for entrance to a lot of jobs. Not only that, you could be wasting

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.350
 your time. Even though you join the service and you get that

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.100
 training experience, if it's in a job that you don't want to do, and

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.850
 then you quit that job, then I gotta tell you could have spent your

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.600
 time doing a job that you would have eventually been doing later on

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.350
 without wasting people's time in the military. So if you can follow

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.100
 directions and you can get along with people, then you'll be fine.
