There's a quote from Shakespeare that I'd like to repeat in one of his

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.180
 plays he said, some advice was given it said "be true to yourself"

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.850
 and I found that that's one of the most important advices that I've

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.520
 ever received whenever I haven't been true to myself and I just like

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.180
 follow the crowd of course I'd always be unhappy and whenever I said

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.850
 "Hey you know what this isn't something I want to do" even though

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.520
 it doesn't seem right like let's go with you know my own personal desires

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.180
 and it always worked out usually work out the best also "follow

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.850
 your dreams" that's a pretty common saying and I think that whenever

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.520
 I've done that whenever I said "you know what this is what I want

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.180
 to do" it's worked out for the best as well so "be true to yourself"

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.850
 and "follow your dreams."
