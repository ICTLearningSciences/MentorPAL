00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.210
So, with the military, your job is your life. You're in the military for

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.560
 twenty four hours. even on your weekends. So, as long as you, you

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.920
 know, encompass this fact, you know, make that a part of your being,

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.280
 then you understand why it is that at night time, you might still

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.640
 be working on some kind of project. So, for instance, if you're, maybe

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.990
 E1 through E6, you have your normal work day and then you might be

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:38.350
 called back in sometimes to make sure that a night event can go on

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.710
 as required and nobody ever has a problem with that but usually, for

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.060
 E1 through E6, they have a full-time job. When we're on deployment,

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.420
 which means that we're out there fighting the war, then they're called

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.780
 all the time. When you're back home and you have your family life,

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.140
 you're expected to go home every single night, then it's, it can

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.490
 be a little bit tricky, trying to balance both of them. Your civilian

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.850
 life is, it can be really tough.
