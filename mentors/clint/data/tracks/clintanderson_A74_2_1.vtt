00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.300
The Navy is different than other branches in a lot of different ways but

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.760
 I think, about the second or third year that I was in the military,

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.210
 that I was in the Navy, I saw it as four different types, maybe five

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.670
 if you considered the Coast Guard. So, if you want to be the soldier

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.120
 that you hear about in the movies, then you join the Marines. They

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.580
 work out a lot more, they're the first people that start to fight

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.030
 the war. You have to, you know, be pretty strong and pretty brave,

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.490
 in the other branches too but more so for the Marines. If you want

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.940
 to be similar to the Marines but you want the tough lifestyle, you want

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.400
 the, you know, the rough, rugged fighting but you're more mechanically

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.850
 oriented, then you can try the Army. So, the Army, that's when

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.300
 you drive in tanks, that's when you set up communication systems in

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.760
 the middle of the desert. So, they're kind of Marines but they're

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.210
 not the first ones out there. If you want a, kind of, more civilian

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.670
 style job, then you join the Air Force. Air Force is known that you,

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.120
 it's known that you have some of the best equipment. For instance,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.580
 at Travis Air Force Base, they have excellent golf clubs. They have,

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.030
 you have basically, a nine to five job. You can, kind of, sit in office

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.490
 many times. It's not always that case. You know, you can find lots

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.940
 of different jobs in any service but this is what was going on in

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.400
 my mind in the second year that I was in the Navy. So, the Navy is

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.850
 different from all of those. So, for instance, when you're on deployment,

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.300
 when you're six months, when you're traveling around in the middle

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.760
 of the ocean for six months, it's not like you're working out

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.210
 every day, also it's not a nine to five job in an office because you're

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.670
 working pretty much like, the whole day, you know, and it's not

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.120
 in an air conditioned office. It's sometimes down in the middle of the

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.580
 plants. The thing that the Navy has going for it is that you should

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.030
 be very technical. You should know your job better than any of your

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.490
 civilian counterparts. So, if you want to be known as someone who's

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.940
 like, pretty bright with when it comes to computers, when it comes

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.400
 to mechanical components, fixing machines, then the Navy is for you.
