00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.800
The mentor that I had that really influenced the way that I think about

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.760
 right now is probably Professor Wilkinson. He was my first computer

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.710
 science professor in community college. I had never really programmed

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.670
 before. Most people had, you know, programmed something when they

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.620
 were in high school but I'd never even coded anything in my life and

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.580
 I took two classes with them and just the way that he wrote things

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.530
 on the board, you know, boxes and squares, all professors do that,

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.490
 so obviously he was my first one so he did it for me too. But it really

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.440
 opened my eyes into how computer scientists think. Halfway through

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.400
 the class, I realized that, you know, when I am sitting behind the

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.350
 computer, typing so much, which is what I thought computer science

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.300
 was, I thought it was like ones and zeros, bits and numbers. Most

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.260
 of the time, he was writing and drawing things up on the board, up on

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.210
 the white screen and even right now, you know, when I'm when coding,

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.170
 most of what I do, a lot of what I do is with sheets of paper and

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.120
 drawing and pictures and stuff. So, he really, like, kind of opened

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.080
 my eyes to what a computer scientist does. A computer scientist doesn't

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.030
 type code on the computer screen. That's his tool but what he does

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.990
 is, he thinks logically about his product and that consists of visual

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.940
 representations and those are things that are interesting to me

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.900
 and Professor Wilkinson was the first person that, kind of, showed

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.850
 it to me.
