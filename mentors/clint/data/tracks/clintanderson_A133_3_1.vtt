00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.240
When I was a kid, I think I was more interested in like the humanities

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.630
 side of life. So I tried to do a little bit of piano when I was a kid.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.020
 Me and my brother would go to piano lessons and I you know was a

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.410
 part of a black gospel choir. So I would always look at the guys that

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.790
 are sitting there you know dabbling on the piano really fast, and

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.180
 I thought you know what I can make songs like that. I had, I listened

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.570
 to rock and pop you know, Prince, Michael Jackson. So I thought,

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.960
 you know I'm listening to these songs and it gives me this feeling in

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.350
 my heart, so maybe I'm a musician. As it turned out, my brother didn't

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.740
 want to go to piano lessons anymore, so my grandmother didn't want

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.130
 to just take me by myself you know. So she cancelled our lessons

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.520
 and that was the end of that musical career. My mother was an artist,

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.910
 so I would always be like sketching on pads and stuff I would be

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.290
 drawing like animated characters X-Men and Spiderman and I was getting

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.680
 up there in my ability, but it also failed out. So yeah when I was

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.070
 young I actually wanted to do like you know like the non engineering,

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.460
 non STEM things, but life has a way of like throwing you in a different

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.850
 direction.
