00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.480
Things that keep me up at night are probably the same things that keep

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.110
 most Americans up and that's, you know, of course I fear for my life.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.740
 No one wants to die. I think that even the most hardcore, you know,

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.380
 Marines, they don't want to go to war. Of course, they'd like our

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.010
 politicians to, you know, do things diplomatically. Everybody has family

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.640
 back home, everybody wants to, you know, see the next day. So,

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.270
 I'm not a coward, you know, when it becomes time to go fight, then

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.900
 I will but it's not like I want to fight. What I want to do is, I want

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.530
 everybody in the world to live together in peace and harmony but

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.170
 I know that that doesn't happen. So, what keeps me up at night, is thinking

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.800
 that any day now, any second, there could be a terrorist attack,

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.430
 you know, near my home. The people that I care about can be wounded,

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.060
 injured or the fact that I might have to go over there and you

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.690
 know, maybe put someone else in harm, you know, someone that I'm attacking

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.320
 or support someone who, you know,. attacks somebody. I don't

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.960
 want to see people dead or killed just like most people in the military

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.590
 I think but you know, even though it does keep me up at night,

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.220
 you know, I do have a good sleep and then the next morning, I wake up

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.850
 and I go to my job.
