00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.990
During my academic career I guess I made a lot of different choices that

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.140
 like put me on a different path. So for instance, when I was young

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.280
 I really wanted to be a linguist. I wanted to know five different

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.420
 languages by the time I was twenty five. I wanted to speak fluently

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.560
 and travel in my jet around the world and I don't think engineers really

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.710
 do that so much, so when I joined the military to become a nuclear

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.850
 technologist, I realized that I wasn't doing something that I was

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.990
 passionate for, I was doing something that was challenging instead

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:47.140
 and that still worked out, I still enjoyed it. I still enjoyed doing

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.280
 the Navy for that, but I had to kind of change my mind set for that.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.420
 After I got out of the military, then I had this eight years of being

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.560
 a nuclear technologist I could become like Homer Simpson, make

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.710
 lots of money and I had so much experience that I could have a high

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.850
 paying job, a high position job out in the real world. However after

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.990
 studying what computer science is and finding my passion in that, I

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.140
 kind of gave up that nuclear technology course and I studied engineering

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.280
 and computer science which is kind of like starting from fresh.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.420
 So the two choices that I made, number one from humanities to engineering

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.560
 over to nuclear technology and then after that from nuclear

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.710
 technology to computer science those are really distinct choices and

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.850
 it is what it is I'm happy with my decisions.
