00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.300
So, I have to admit, many people who are actively working for the Navy

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.750
 don't really know how they fit into the big picture and that's by design.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.200
 It's very specialized. So, for instance, as an E1, E2, E3, your

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.650
 whole entire world is to do this technical job, to fix a pump, to

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.100
 paint this wall and you might not see it but making sure that pump

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.550
 is fixed or making sure that wall is painted, makes sure that the ship

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.000
 can run. Making sure that the ship can run, make sure that the officer

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.450
 can fly a jet, making sure that that jet is fixed and that pilot

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.900
 knows his information, make sure that he can drop this bomb, making

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.350
 sure that bomb drops, make sure that the battle is won, making sure

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.800
 that the battle is won, make sure the war is won. So, when you are

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.250
 painting that wall, you don't really see how that is actually helping

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.700
 you win the war in Afghanistan but it does. So, the higher you get

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.150
 in your enlisted pay grade, the more you see that big picture. I'm

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.600
 an E7, so my responsibility is to know how this unit can help the

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.050
 civilians, make sure that this aircraft carrier runs fine and I think

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.500
 as officers, the higher you get, if you're a captain, you make sure

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.950
 that this aircraft carrier fits in this realm of the region so that,

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.400
 like we have power over there, we can dominate our foes. So, it depends

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.850
 on your pay grade.
