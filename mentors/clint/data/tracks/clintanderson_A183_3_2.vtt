00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.430
There are a lot of reasons that people leave the military. The military

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.010
 has a lot of great reasons to stay, the retirement benefits, the job

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.590
 security, serve the country. However, I think especially when people

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.170
 want to make a higher salary, and they find a good job outside and

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.740
 they want to just try to do something else, then that can be a good

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.320
 motivating factor. The military can be very dangerous, especially

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.900
 like for the people that send the planes off. If you do that you know

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.480
 every single year, month after month, day after day, then that could

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.060
 affect your hearing. You can be in many dangerous situations and

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.640
 some people just don't want to do that type of job anymore, that can

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.220
 be risky. Another reason that people leave the military is because

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.800
 they want to see their family grow. When you're on deployment that's

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.380
 a good six months that you don't see your daughter grow. You don't

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.960
 see your son grow, you're not with your wife, you're not with your

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.530
 husband. So after a few of those deployments, you kinda start to miss

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.110
 that, you actually want to see when your spouse has their kid you

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.690
 know. If your wife is pregnant you want to actually see it be born.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.270
 And I know a lot of people who weren't there for that, so that's the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.850
 third reason that I see a lot of people leave the military.
