00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.910
Grad school and especially college isn't really for everyone, you have

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.970
 to have a certain type of determination to be successful, and if you're

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.040
 going to go to college, I suggest you try to be successful. You

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.100
 don't wanna go there and you know not do your homework, be late for

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.160
 class, waste all of that money, and then not have a normal job, you

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.230
 know. Do school for three years and then drop out, that's one of the

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.290
 worst things that you can do. Even though it is a good experience

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.350
 for you, you meet different people, you get to explore the world possibly

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.410
 with education abroad, you get to be in some really interesting

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.470
 classes with some really smart people. In the bigger picture you always

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.540
 wanna be doing something that's promoting you to like a final

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.600
 goal. So I think that if you're not determined, and you know that homework

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.660
 isn't really your route, and especially if you don't want to

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.730
 do research, if you're planning on going to grad school then probably

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.790
 you should probably get out there and do some vocational stuff, have

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.850
 a real job first and then come back when you're ready.
