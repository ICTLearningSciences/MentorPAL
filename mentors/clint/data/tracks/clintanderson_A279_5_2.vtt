During the vast majority of the time, alcohol is not allowed at all. There

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.140
 are lots of young people and the commanding officer doesn't want

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.780
 to see one sip of it go into their mouths. There are a few instances

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.420
 where alcohol is tolerated. I think I saw maybe four or five instances

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.060
 while we were deployed that everyone got a blue ticket, and you

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.710
 give your blue ticket to the guy, the whole ship stops, nobody's working,

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.350
 except to make the ship you know like kinda sit in the water

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.990
 and make sure everything's safe. But for that one day that one evening

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.640
 you give a blue ticket, they give you one case of alcohol, and then

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.280
 you're done. Yeah some people would kind of like swap something

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.920
 out to get like two or three, but no one was drunk. It's just to get

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.560
 some alcohol on your tongue, and then that's it. Later on that night

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.210
 everything was cleared, all of the alcohol was gone, and back to work

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.850
 as usual.
