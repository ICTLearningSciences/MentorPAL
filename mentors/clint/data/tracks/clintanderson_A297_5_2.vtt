00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.940
The part of my future that I'm most worried about would probably have

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.020
 to be whether I'll be good enough. So, I want to make my own business.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.110
 I want to make games, educational games for millions of people that

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.200
 are going to change their lives, affect the American school system,

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.280
 hopefully change the world. To do something like that, you to be

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.370
 pretty bright, you have to be pretty smart. Maybe, to make that type

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:36.460
 of business, you have to be able to speak to people pretty well and

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.550
 have a good business plan, good business model. I'm not sure if I can

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.630
 do that. With any big challenge, you have to have the right tools

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.720
 to begin and currently I don't have it. The good side is, I'm trying.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.810
 I'm in USC, I'm learning every day, I'm teaching English in Japan

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.890
 and I'm getting the teaching skills that are required to, that I'm

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.980
 going to need when I do my business later on. I'm working towards it.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.070
 Maybe I'll be successful, maybe not. The cool thing is, on my path,

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.150
 if I have to do something different, let's say I start working for

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.240
 NASA and I like the job and I'm satisfied and I like my car and have

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.330
 a good family life, then I can stop and I can continue that job. On

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.420
 the other hand, it's good to have that challenge. It's way off in

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.500
 the future that, you know, very very successful, financially wealthy

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.590
 and very very difficult and that's spurring me to keep trying. So I'm

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.680
 unsure about that and I'm unsure about whether I'll be good enough

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.760
 but hopefully, with everything that I'm doing, I'll wind up someplace

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.850
 that I need to be. I'll wind up someplace very successful.
