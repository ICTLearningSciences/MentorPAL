If you're planning on joining the military then there are some things

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.230
 that can start you on the right path. One can be the Junior ROTC program,

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.930
 the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps program that, it's kinda

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.620
 like a little military within the high school. They allow you to

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.310
 learn about marching and formations. They give you some books to read

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.000
 and they tell you about the military structure. So it's really helping

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.700
 you along the way and you know trying to learn about what jobs

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.390
 there are talking to military members . There's also the air cadets

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.080
 and I think in some cases the Boy Scouts can actually, and Girl Scouts

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.770
 as well, can show you some things about like discipline and listening

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.470
 to others. Their structure is I think very similar to the military

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.160
 as well, so these are things that kind of prepare you mentally

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.850
 and physically for a future military service.
