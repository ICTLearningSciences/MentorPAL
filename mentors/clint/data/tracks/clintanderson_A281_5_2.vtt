00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.240
Depending on the type of job you have, the amount of training that you've

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.640
 done before really comes into play into whether you can get that

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.030
 job later on or not. So you can start your career without any type

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.420
 of training, and the military provides all the training for you. There

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.810
 are other STEM jobs, for instance if you wanna go to NASA, if you

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.210
 want to work at DARPA, like really high level places like that, that

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.600
 you need a degree. You have to have a bachelor's of science something

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.990
 that's accredited by an institution to even be considered for the

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.390
 job at all. So in that case, your training is definitely required.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.780
 Not only do you need a degree that says that you can do the job, but

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.170
 you're gonna be tested and grilled during the interview process where

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.560
 they're going to see if you learned the thing that your degree says

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.960
 that you do know. So in those cases it's very hard to have that

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.350
 degree. Middle jobs in between, it varies. They're gonna really grill

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.740
 you pretty hard during the interview process with questions that you

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.140
 don't really know about. Simple questions and hard questions. The

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.530
 simple questions of course they're going to want you to know, the harder

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.920
 questions what they're looking for is the way that you're trying

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.310
 to solve the problem. They're not going to expect you to know, maybe

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.710
 you'd have to be seasoned to know it, and they want to see the way

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.100
 that the question stews in your mind. They want to see if you know

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.490
 how to attack the problem, and if you know to ask them the right questions,

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.890
 to ask your teammates the right questions, so that they can

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.280
 provide you with the answers so you can finally come up with a solution.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.670
 If you can't, you don't have a structure in your mind, then you

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.060
 probably won't get the job. So for those types of jobs, you just

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.460
 have to have a basic introduction and you learn the rest on the job

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.850
 during your work experience there.
