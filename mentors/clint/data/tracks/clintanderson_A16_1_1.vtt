00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.380
So, joining the military is a dangerous career. If you want to join the

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.920
 Navy but you're scared of going into battle, then there are obviously

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.450
 jobs for you but you have to inherently realize that being in the

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.980
 military is by definition a dangerous career. So, I was on a ship

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.520
 for the most of the time but they could have sent me anywhere. So, you

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.050
 have to be willing to accept that fact. However, even on the ship,

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.580
 there are dangers. For instance, you could be telling the ships where

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.120
 to go but they say that the top of the aircraft carrier is one of

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.650
 the most dangerous places that you can be, it's one of the most dangerous

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.180
 jobs. Additionally, once you're back home, you're with your

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.720
 family, you have a normal job but they could say, "Hey, you know what?

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.250
 We need more people out there in the field." So, they could just

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.780
 call you and you could be with the army people, with the marines people,

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.320
 fighting wars. But for the most part, the air force and the navy,

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.850
 they tend to have supporting roles to the army and the marines.
