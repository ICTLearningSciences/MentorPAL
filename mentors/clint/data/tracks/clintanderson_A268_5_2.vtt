00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.500
I'm not really familiar with the types of uniforms that the other services

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.150
 wear, I'm very familiar with what the Navy wears, and I have to

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.810
 say I really like the uniforms that we wear. These ones are called

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.460
 camies, and we have matching top and bottom and a cool hat, and it looks

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.110
 very very military. When we're working and we can get greasy in

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.760
 lower parts of the ships, we also have these things called coveralls,

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.420
 which are all blue, it's one size and you just put your legs in and

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.070
 you put the tops and you zip up and it looks like an oil changer

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.720
 for a car. It's the same type of uniform and you can wear these belts

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.370
 that allow you to put in you know wrenches and tools and fuse pullers

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.020
 and things like that, so it's very, it's work related. In our off

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.680
 time, not our off time, in our non shipboard time then you can have

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.330
 these nicer uniforms. So we have our blues, our dress blues, which

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.980
 is really nice for the lower classes for E1 2 3 4 5 and 6 it looks

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.630
 like the cracker jacks that you see everywhere, when you see the guy

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.280
 kissing the girl in the famous statue, the uniform that he's wearing,

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.940
 he's wearing his dress blues. Those are like the really nice uniforms

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.590
 that you wear for special occasions, and they also come in a white

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.240
 color as well. And it's, they get dirty very very fast but those

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.890
 are the coolest ones to look at, it's kinda like the button up one.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.550
 If you remember Tom Cruise from Top Gun, he looks really so cool like

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.200
 an officer, well those are the uniforms that we wear. I think they're

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.850
 some of the nicest uniforms in all of the services.
