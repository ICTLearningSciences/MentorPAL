The military is kinda like a microcosm of the real world. When you start

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.790
 to join the military, the first couple of, your first major experience

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.260
 is going to be obviously boot camp. Then after that you're going

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.730
 to go to your A school. And, at least for me, for what I've experienced

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.200
 with my college, there's no difference. You get your housing

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.670
 paid for, and you get to wear a cool uniform, but otherwise it's very

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.140
 very similar to college. Yeah, the college experience, you're gonna

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.610
 work more, way more, in the military then a regular college. But you're

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.090
 still opening books, you're still studying, you're still talking

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.560
 to your friends, still talking to your professor, and you don't worry

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.030
 about a normal nine to five job, so much, that I could be sweating

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.500
 and sweeping and stuff. At the end of that, then you start a nine

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.970
 to five job with the military. So if the question is how is the military

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.440
 different then college. college is four years of intensive study,

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.910
 military is they just give you the basic information, really quick

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.380
 really pass in two weeks to two years, and then they send you off

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.850
 into the world.
