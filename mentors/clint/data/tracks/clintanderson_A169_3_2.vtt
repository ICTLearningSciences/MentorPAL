Since you're going to be in the military, you have to make sure that you're

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.350
 on time for things. So if you show up late, then people will look

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.600
 at you "Hey you know come on time next time." You show up late twice

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.850
 then you get scolded, come late three times then chances are you

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.100
 could be sitting in front of a chief having him and other chiefs like

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.350
 come down on you, and you do it four times then you probably get

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.600
 written up with the counseling check, which means that like I said

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.850
 "Hey like I told this guy it's a cause for being fired from the military

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.100
 so make sure that you don't do it again." So yeah if that's not

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.350
  your deal you know, you show up whenever you want, then you should

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.600
 erase that from your vocabulary because the Navy's pretty tight with

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.850
 their schedules.
