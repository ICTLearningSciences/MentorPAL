00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.780
While you're on deployment, while the ship that you're on is out there

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.720
 in the middle of the ocean, we do have internet service. However the

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.650
 computers that can access that internet are basically being used a

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.580
 lot for for work related things. Most people have laptops, but they're

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.520
 mainly used to watch DVDs, to you know do their little odd non wifi

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.450
 connected things. There's no wifi on the ship, there's no outside

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.380
 communication in that regard. However, there are, you can still access

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.320
 Facebook, you can still access Google, you can still access normal

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.250
 internet things, but to be able to get behind a computer and use

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.180
 those things, you'd have to be a high level or it would have to be

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.120
 like for instance in the middle of the night. And even though you can

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.050
 access those things, there are probably some procedures in place that

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.980
 says you know you should limit your use or don't use those things

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.920
 at all. Like for instance social media, normal web browsing is fine,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.850
 but don't expect so much of it. I didn't really use it so much.
