00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.470
So a regulator, it has different meanings depending on what type of job

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.100
 you're doing. So if you ask a mechanic what a regulator is, it's something

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.730
 that regulates some kind of flow. So for instance you could

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.350
 have water going in this direction and then you maybe turn a switch

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.970
 or apply some, some setting to a control mechanism that separates it into

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.600
 different, different paths. So let's say need a little bit of

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.230
 water and you have a lot of water over here then you regulate it so

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.850
 that only a little bit flows out. But let's say you need lots of water

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.470
 here, then you regulate it so that there's lots of water that comes

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.100
 out. So the same thing happens with an electrician, my job. We have

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.730
 voltage regulators so let's say you have a pump that needs twenty

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.350
 volts and you have a machine that can provide all of that, you just

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.970
 don't wanna pump all of the current from that machine into that little,

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.600
 little box, right. So you have a regulator that provides the right

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.230
 voltage so that that voltage will just allow the correct current

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.850
 to go through that machine. That's a voltage regulator.
