00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.350
I get motivated to go to work because it's fun, you know, that's the simple

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.850
 fact of it. When I was in school, you know, I had like math and

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.350
 science and physics and chemistry and nothing really like, pushed

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.850
 me to, you know, want to learn myself but computer science had something

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.350
 about it that is, there's a little bit of math but not too much

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.850
 to make me scared, there is a little bit of graphics to, you know,

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.350
 at least so I could see what it was that I was doing. You know, there

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.850
 was a little bit of like logic but not too difficult. Everything is

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.350
 in moderation and it's as hard as you make it. So, because there's

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.850
 so much that it's such a broad category, I found my little niche, you

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.350
 know, it happened to be virtual reality but like, I've experienced

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.850
 like, lots of things in computer science and they all had something

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.350
 that kind of drove me to want to learn more. So, no other subject

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.850
 has actually done that for me except for computer science. So, I think

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.350
 all of it's inspiring to try to, it's all inspiring because it's

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.850
 fun. That's the reason.
