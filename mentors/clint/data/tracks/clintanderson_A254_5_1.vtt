00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.380
College is quite a unique experience. Everybody should try it if they

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.910
 can. For me, how college matter to me, it allowed me to really gain

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.440
 credentials for a job that otherwise I wouldn't. So I'm going to be

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.970
 going to an internship with NASA pretty soon and I see that the jobs

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.510
 that NASA requires, they need a college degree for it. So if you don't

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.040
 have a degree then you can't get into their program. However, other

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.570
 computer science jobs that I'm considering, they don't require anything

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.100
 at all. So you could be walking straight out of high school

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.630
 and you can have that job. The only thing they require is "Can you program

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.160
 this? Yes or no?" And if you can whether you have an MIT degree

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.690
 or the you just have a GED from your local high school. As long as

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.230
 you can do the job then you can do it. So it's really important to

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.760
 understand the types of jobs that you want. Realize that some of them

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.290
 need a sheet of paper that says that you can do the job, and some

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.820
 of them just are mostly based on experience in your own life. For me,

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.350
 I joined the Navy, I got this certificate from the military, which

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.880
 isn't a college class and then after I got out, then I could have

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.410
 this really high paying job without going to college myself. There are

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.940
 many people who say college isn't that important. However, what they're

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.470
 failing to realize is that when you go to college you're in a

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.010
 group of a lot of people similar to you, similar intelligence to you,

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.540
 going to the same classesas you, and being in that group really pushes

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.070
 you to try your best for four years. And at the end of that, then

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.600
 you get a sheet of paper, yes, and that allows you to, it opens

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.130
 more jobs for you, yes, but that entire experience is the college experience

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.660
 that many people have that you'll be glad that you had. It's

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.190
 the motivation from teachers, from your fellow peers, it's the late

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.730
 night study sessions, and all of that really makes you mature as a

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.260
 person. Not everybody needs it, but if you think that you have enough

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.790
 money and you have the time, and you want a job that requires that

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.320
 sheet of paper, the degree, then I'd say college is the right choice

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.850
 for you.
