The JROTC is a community high school club, that's kind of how I would

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.070
 describe it.  It's a place where students can go and they will do community

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.180
 service and they'll learn how to drill so it's like also disciplinary

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.290
 but then also you're like doing academics in your learning

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.410
 how to orientier through a forest you're learning how but how to read

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.520
 weather maps.  It really encompasses all of, like everything that

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.630
 you learn in the military, but in more ofa relaxed environment in a

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.740
 way to give back to the community.  In high school, in the JROTC program

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.850
 you'll definitely wear your uniform but probably just once.
