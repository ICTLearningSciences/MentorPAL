00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.350
One of the things that the Navy marine corps and really the US government

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.850
 does really well is that what you're paid is based on how long you've

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.350
 been in and what your rank is.  So I’m an 01 and you can find

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.850
 my salary online, just type in “01 navy normal pay” and you'll be able

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.350
 to see how much I make as well as what every single other rank makes.
