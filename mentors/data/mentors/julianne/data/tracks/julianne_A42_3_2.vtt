One of the biggest takeaways I have from ROTC is discipline and commitment.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.180
  You have to really be committed to studying, not only for school,

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.850
 but like also being committed to you know working out and like

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.520
 being the best person that you can be and like short periods of times

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.180
 because you have to be able to schedule yourself well because you're

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.850
 going to be booked all the time especially in college.  So I wake

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.520
 up PT then class then I'm going to go study for an hour at the library

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.180
 before I have lunch with friends still making time for yourself

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.850
 and then you have more class and then you might have like evening meetings

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.520
 and then you want to make sure it like you're able to that might

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.180
 have some downtime like just for yourself so like maybe watch a

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.850
 TV show or maybe just relax and read a book.  So in order to have a

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.520
 lifestyle like this like you need to be committed to like taking care

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.180
 of yourself and making sure that you’re always on time and scheduling

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.850
 yourself properly.
