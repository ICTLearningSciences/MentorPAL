00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.710
My time in the ROTC program started actually when I was in high school

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.560
 and I joined the JROTC program and my time in the JROTC program started

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.420
 when I accidentally enrolled into it.  So I was choosing classes

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.280
 and it was my freshman year and I didn't know what classes I wanted

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.140
 to take but I am more of like a science person, like an engineer and

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.990
 so I saw this class and it said nautical science and I said, ah,

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.850
 like another science class like that would be cool so I signed up for

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.710
 it and my dean comes up to me later and she was like, “Congratulations

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.560
 Julianne you've just joined the JROTC program” and I was like,

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.420
 “I'm sorry I'm a cheerleader I don't really do those things,” but I

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.280
 ended up falling in love with the program in high school and got picked

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.140
 up for a full ride scholarship to USC through the NROTC program

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.990
 to go to the University of Southern California and that's how I ended

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.850
 up in the NROTC program.
