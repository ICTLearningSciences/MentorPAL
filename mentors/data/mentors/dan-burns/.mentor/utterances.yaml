    I had to make sure that as an engineering officer, A ll both engines online, ready
    to go. And if we didn't have the engineering parts, I had three gas turbines that
    provided all the electrical power for their ships along the lights. All the power
    for the computer. Well, if one of the equipment if one of the generators went
    down now I'm in a casualty response mode and my decisions would revolve around
    what it would take to keep that generator that electrical load. Morning. You would
    think that's, you know, an easy decision. But it, Zelig, when you're driving your
    car, you've got to go from Washington D c down to, uh, go for you have no dance

    I'm gonna be taking on fuel from the Shasta. Okay. What is that gonna take? That
    means I need to make sure that my fueling alignment to receive fuel. That was
    a personal thing, That responsibility for the chief engineer. I had to personally
    verify Valvoline so that when we took fuel from another ship keep us under way,
    doing our mission for the nation. That was my personal responsibility. My job
    was to make sure that every one of those valves was a line. And I had a dedicated
    checklist to do that. So there's no one. Where is my checklist decision over to
    Can I get and see every one of those valves inspect? Expect when you inspect.
    So I have to run around and that it's things like that. A deadly evolution doesn't
    sound like much, but when you're the person responsible for taking on fuel to
    make sure that we don't spill any fuel when we're taking on fuel, that's a very

  transcript: s So how did my work day change over the life of my career? Um, I will
    say that as a divisional officer at sea at sea duty, um, my day entailed a lot
    of running around and inspecting, making sure equipment worked a lot of spot checks.
    Um, coming back as a department head. The one thing that was that was different
    was, you know, now people are looking at you. So now all of a sudden is not 25.
    30. There's, ah, 150 people that are looking to you for the answer. A za chief
    engineer. You know, there's only two times when I had hard casualties, where where
    the ship waas suffering from a major catastrophic casualty. And we were on the
    verge off what is known as being going cold and dark. And so at that point, when
    the cash Lee was called away and I had to get my transport myself, you know, very
    fast, very quickly. Down to the central control station CCs. Everyone's looking
    around, and at that point, it knows why everyone's looking at you. You're the
    man now that is different from being a divisional officer. That was the one time
    when all eyes go to you and it's your train, your war sense, your knowledge or
    experience that you have to rely on is no one else but that voice. So that's the
    thing about sea duty. There's always as things are gonna change. Time's gonna
    change between division officer, the former head. But as a department head, you
    need to use your experience from your division. Also yours. What is it like? How
    is it gonna play out, Um, and then on on shore duty? Um, I personally as unsure
    of it in my first short tour, you know, I was a student, so that wasn't too taxing
    at the Naval Postgraduate School. I just had to push myself, too. Get my A's,
    you know, and push on through and learn as much as I could. Um, for instance,
    because the degree I had was National Security Affairs stepped on television.
    Well, that qualified me later on for my second and final active duty short tour.
    And that was at the hospital to your affairs at Central Intelligence Agency. And
    so I had to rely on my knowledge game, uh, from years before at a post graduate
    school and on my operational experience, learn how to, uh, act, you know how to
    translate what the fleet is doing and how to use a fleet at the also military
    affairs at the Pentagon with C I A. So you're doing doing Maur cerebral work,
    If you will, when you get to the higher ranks and you're trying to figure out,
    you know, when you're at it at a combatant command, you know what exactly we want
    to do with the missile force, what exactly we're going to do with the submarine
    force? Why are we going to deploy a ballistic submarine to the specifics right
    now? So what are the Indians and the Pakistanis? Perhaps we don't need a submarine
    in the Pacific. Perhaps we needed in the Indian Ocean. That's the kind of thing
    that you do as a senior officer is. Make these recommendations. What is the art
    of the possible? You want to advise the civilians that air advising the National
    Command Authority in C. A. And that's what you're counting on? That's what you
    are being taught to do to be in the right position at the right time, with the
    right knowledge to advise national command authority on what

    before I was married, I I didn't have a care I would move anywhere to do to get
    the job. I wanted to be in California, all the shift those born and raised in Brooklyn.
    So I took the first ship I could find out of the West Coast. After that, the detailers
    would call me and say, You've done a bang up job and now we've got a tour for
    you on the USS Fife on the life was coming out of the yards. San Diego and going
    to you. Chris, get your pants. So that was a change of whole port, which you may
    or may not experience again. You're your time. So the other. In my time, there
    was a lot of moving around. The idea of home standing and staying in one port
    really wasn't a tool that was available. Now they tried A It's a key personnel
    in the home port to minimize the amount of moves, but frankly, it can be done.
    It has done a lot for personnel that are assigned to you. Goose get to Seventh
    Fleet to fifth Fleet once they move you out there, they like to keep you there.
    So they'll move your back to Goto farm ahead school to go to XO school, go to

  transcript: So where do you think you're gonna be in five or 10 years? Okay, it's
    a It's an interesting question. What are you as divisional officer? Where you
    gonna be? His department head. Where you gonna be? His next? That's You have to
    be willing to travel to the job. This is an old saying. If you're ready to travel
    and the ship major squadron, agent job, major, then detailers will move you to
    a ship to shore command that needs you. So how do you plan that career? First,
    you do the best that you can in your current job. Try to get the best fit. You
    can try to get that that no one off ex assigned to the ship's crew and move on
    to the next ship to the next job that you wanted to. Now you want to. So, for
    instance, right now, in my time way changed out from the P 3 to 8. And there were
    a lot of pilots that were trying to qualify for the P eight so they would go ahead
    and get tours that would send them two squadrons with Ph. If you went to a squadron
    that didn't have a P eight and you were kind of, you know, telegraphing detail,
    that you were terminal and you were not going to make a transition. Well, this
    is the thing that it requires you Joo to think about your next career. Where do
    you want to go on the submarine side? Do you want to stay in? The boomers will
    just keep on doing boomers. Ballistic? Yes, est bien the ballistic missile tours
    or no, I want to do a fast attack. I walk fast attacks, and we want to stay with
    fast attacks. Those are completely different mission sets between the boomers
    and the fast attacks. Whoever stay out and do the ballistic missions and protection
    of the nation. Fast attacks are out looking A S w looking for other submarines
    defending the carriers, etcetera, etcetera. So it requires 44 on you. What do
    you want to do with your career? And then one of the things you want to do is
    while you're on your tour president who are doing a great job, you want to go
    ahead and find out as much information as you can. All right? Since you want to
    go ahead and talkto a goober. Skipper, If you're fast that you're on a fast attack
    or if you're on a jewelry, then talk fast attack and vice versa. So one of the
    things is when you do come in from being out at sea. Hey, there's a tendency to
    goto four. Go to the four winds. And you know what? You really want to try to
    go to some of the command functions and try to go and see. Talk about Hey, what
    is that? What is that squadron doing? What is that shift? Do it. Where? What? What
    is that? And that frigates And that, Um do A L. C. S ships coming out. You want
    to find out as much so they can tell you and shape where you'd like to go with
    you.

    when you walk up the brow and gets you a new ship, one thing that the commanding
    officer always has is this standing orders. And before you're gonna be qualified
    as an officer, that import or the officer of the deck underway or the tactical
    action off, Sir, you lost the watch. You're going tohave to know the commanding
    officers standing orders. This is vitally important because these are his one
    on one directions to you to tell you. Call me if this happens. Okay? Most easiest
    thing. One thing is commanding officer to the bridge. Okay, Trust made commanding
    officer will get to the bridge Real point when that war goes out. Because he knows.
    And he will trust you if you have. If you delay calling the commanding Austin
    the bridge, that's what happens in the McCain McCain. I got in trouble. Manning
    Officer did not get to the bridge. So commanding officers standing orders number
    one thing that you need to read. In fact, if you're going to a new ship, you might
    want to ask the exact, you know, can I get a copy off the commanding officer standing
    orders before you even get there. Okay, that shows that you're being aggressive.
    You're leaning forward in the saddle and you want to see his standing orders.
    Now, in addition to that, each night underway our commanding officers night orders
    on the night quarters are equally important. It lays down step by step. Okay.

    actually, on my first ship, I had a master chief Petty officer working, and he
    helped me extremely. So it was important to establish a rapport, establish a relationship
    with Chief Petty Officer and carry out a mission in my ambulance that I was an
    engineering. Also watch. So I had to qualify. So I hasn't used my experience.
    My knowledge, my training too. Get qualified. As you're also watch all the decks,
    all the engineering plant, understand it casually control drills and rely on my
    chief to make sure that I understood how all the technology works and how old
    personnel it into our division. Our teeth. So what's important part is to establish
    a rapport with your cheese and later on it becomes your divisional officer. After
    that, you're always has it. It's It's very simple to do that, and it's very when
    and if that goes south, okay, because it was south. You're not gonna have a Downing

    Women are doing on the watch in the engineering holes. And I would walk the deck
    a lot of times I would just walk Dex, see what the mission Waas. What is the messenger
    of the watch? Go call down to a woman should go down to after steering. Don't
    slough it off. What? Someone else? Do it. Pick up the wash law and go stand the

    room, walk with Dex that, um, department had no no this war example of division
    officers. But as department head, as chief engineer, I was able one time walk
    down. I found out that you know, one of my head the officers had been working

  transcript: it's junior officer aboard your ship before it's gonna be a very important
    for you to earn the trust and respect of men and women in your division. One of
    the easiest things to do for that is to get up, get out of your stay out of the
    water along. Go along the debts off your personnel, go follow the messages of
    the watch. And I'm not just talking about your initial qualifications that you
    would have to do is part of your peak US, your personal qualifications stand personal
    provocation system, US points. Am I talking about getting points? I'm talking
    about getting out and you know, you want to turn in for the night. You got one
    more hour of rack time or do you want to go walk the deck? You'll find the message
    of the watch will climb down light mine shaft bearing, you know, go take the loot
    wall temperatures. Okay. And do that for every launch chef bearing on your ship.
    That is easy. Just walking the deck management by walking around, walking around
    and checking out on what you're moving. So you actually won. It's important for
    you to learn your ship Every ship is different. Laid out a little bit different.
    All ships line. They're supposed to be laid out the same, but some are not. It
    is. You're in combat If you have to go down to a given space and check something
    else flooding damage control. The only way to do that is by walking around. What
    better way to hurt? You know, trust and respect of your personal else by walking
    it with them. For example, you give not divisional officer level. But as a chief
    engineer, we're getting ready to launch the RHIB and your every ship will have
    on away boat. In this case, most of them all. The ridge we had just gotten to
    the ship's. So we had a launch. The RHIB, while part of a peace do after that
    is you tested Once there was a conflict in the instructions. The bullets in base
    at the best engine. But the Gangsters, the plant maintenance system is do not
    test. Without water flowing on, the most middle watch could have damage the ship.
    Once that was explained to May, we wrote a procedure to take care of that and
    get it and the A Gator. Oh, yeah. The ship won't be damaged. Everything and that
    He put the word out. The engineer stuck on 48 hangars over with Postmates. So
    engineers win. I didn't score one. Most amazing. So I was a farmer. I do, but
    just there's gonna be a lot of examples. Where? Mushroom walking a while. You
    won't find these examples. If you stay in your state grow if you stay in the water.
    Okay. You're not gonna want your shift. You're not gonna learn that. It is not
    a good way to start your career. You want to walk around, You want to know your
    shift, You want you.

    is off. Because again they are all your spaces and so you don't want to miss it

    would underway in a port way would on a pretty much with the warder, You're really
    tight with your wardrobe Now. There would be official ship's functions where you
    know the division that party way would have division Christmas parties on the
    bigger ships. You have multiple parties. There are departments get together. So
    I don't know, too. I will say 11 thing. No one really likes having to go to a
    party of being elected to go to a party. So if I was the senior officer at the
    parties, I would arrive first, arrive on time scheduled time. But I'd also be
    first and what the crew party. So it's about that you never want to be seen with
    dictatorial. They work for you during the day, you know, let them have their time
    off, and so that's a delicate balance that you have to farm

    you have to be on your way and it depends where you hit the ship and its shore
    and see cycle patient. So if you report to a ship in the shipyard, that's you.
    Awhile you report to the ship while she's on deployment. That's great. Personally,
    I met my ship on the deployment. I was able to qualify for Yau in 81 days. And
    then there was just not enough time to go topside and qualified. So then we went
    to the shore rotation and we were in port for a year before we deployed again.
    And then I qualified for my also south. I'm assuming this is also that underway.
    Also, that underway requires a year A good, solid year off underway time doing
    all of the evolutions. Okay, that means, you know, anchoring. That means unwraps,
    refuelings, etcetera, etcetera, award, etcetera, personal transfers. So a year
    qualifies. Also that import two weeks, two weeks

  transcript: right. An evaluation off. Almost promote. First off use most below.
    You need to use E t. Remember that your ranking? Um, the piece needs to be above
    You were breaking percentage. You need to know you're writing percent. And given
    someone in e. T. Who doesn't deserve it doesn't do you justice. Two previous sailors
    that work for you. Because if you, you know, rank someone artificially high. That
    hurts the people that came before you. When that person comes up for promotion,
    this promotion board will pull out your average overall. So you have to be very
    jealous and guarding numerical likings. And where you look, people war got absolutely
    do that. What else to put in there? What man? Woman's performance should speak
    for itself so quickly. The heart example in there. Okay, first and foremost, you
    know, awarded Navy Cross isn't lead it. That's why no one is, you know, awarded
    a legion of marriage for his last. Okay, um, awarding the life saving medal because
    the sailor went out and save a person was choking the revivals. You know, any
    any awards need to be mentioned up top top right away and then, uh, stating that.
    You know what? You would welcome this person back to your living room at any time
    since the message. Since the message that it's not faint praise that you would
    serve with this cellar again, that that is a good message. So said, um, fill out
    the rest of the block 41 helps, you know, Don't you want to limit on the person?
    And it said that recommending for seeming toe Advil program This this person envisions
    encapsulate represents everything that Apple born meant. He established this even
    terrible. Um, this person should yet more education than more leadership training
    to help lead our nation and all fleet into the vest generation of war fighters.
    So there are ways to say it to document it. Right? But start with, you know, had
    safely oversaw, you know, 10,000 steaming hours without incident. Transferred
    two million barrels of fuel underway from external shipping from the supply ships,
    replenishment ships and internally transfer. You know, another 1,000,000 gallons
    as we safely steamed for a year under way. Okay, that's incredible. Number of
    people like to see big numbers like that. Okay. Had with the landing LSC leading
    safety enlisted one exit fee evaluator two for 200 safe landings. I want that
    person when they were coming. So first and foremost fine points that the person
    And if the person is that walk on water, I need everything that I'm just saying.
    But if the person is that important, he or she should be able to give you so for
    tidbits to help, right? No fit. You tell me. I can't like the Fed rep. I mean,
    I need some bullets to help differentiate you.

    out off for the officers. If you're a degree officer, we're on the pack. It has
    about four minutes in the war fighting. Well, if you fill one out, okay? And you're
    sending a message. Many words like with Ward that Well, perhaps not the greatest
    war fighter. So this is where you have to watch a lot of rocks filled red flags.
    One walk is missed or not observed. If if the CEO choose. Not observed a lot observes
    needs to be explained in lock 41 you have little or one. Well, why? Oh, those
    are because you just rewarded Ward. Two weeks skill and the super had a change
    of command. So we have a chance with period. Okay, that is okay. You wanna be
    hates you against all the other officers that have been there for half. Okay,
    He's gonna take their animal. You so red flags. You have to be careful on that
    one. Any not observed? You know, I had best be explained, and then you know what?
    Anything less than 50 I know that seems a lot you know, But it wasn't. You know
    why? What happened? It's a lot would want is the chance to explain. So another
    thing to do. You know, seriously, you have to have a day for day accountability
    off your fit. Well, if you were in transit somewhere, uh, if you took a month,
    just four months of school and training in route to your new ship, you better
    put that on the new chefs, you know? So you see, So the finger of Ward C Day for
    day, Howard. Huge red flag. If there is a gap in your coverage, you know what
    happened. What do you do for a day? You're off. You cannot have. It's got to be
    explained somewhere. Okay? I was in transit. I was at school. I was traveling.
    All that needs to be explained in the block for one. Okay. And you know, if the
    award what a thing to do, you leave a command and you've been nominated for a
    meritorious service medal. You've been nominated for the League of America, but
    it hasn't been received yet, But you gotta go to your next command. Well, make
    sure that it says on the ship that you're leaving nominated for Meritorious service
    medal. And then when you get to your new command, it is awarded Meritorious Service
    Medal for performance. On my last command, it's got to be explained leaving and
    the last thing I would say about awards. No words dicey but awards. Everyone is
    expected to have a going away metal or war messages when you don't have a war.
    That's the message that the old man says to the board saying Not worth it Now
    the fact that everyone has an award, how do you break that? That means you have
    to somehow break out during your tour and get your war. So if you could admit
    to award and an inventory ward, Oh whoa, that you I do walk on water Elevated
    three feet. Ball deserves. So it's a tricky I think about awards. Your master
    it, you'll get good, wish you well with it. It's not a pretty system. Was the
    system that we have, and I think it's more honest than what this 06 has observed
    from the Air Force in the Army. You said it in the Army. Maybe there is other
    perspectives altogether, and it's going maybe
