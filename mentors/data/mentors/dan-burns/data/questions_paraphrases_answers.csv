,,dan-burns,What skills do you wish you had mastered before entering your profession?,"So what skills? What I like to have mastered before my profession. Um um Naval Academy. And so I learned a lot, and we had four years of practice, and we have summer cruises at the Naval Academy. That was very important to help me, uh, get along. I know that some while our fellow officers, um, they wish they had dunmore scuba to prepare for being a seal for to prepare them to be buds. Um, 80 years, there was some time at the academy that would've been available to me to go the flying club and a couple private pilot's license. No, I didn't do that for some of the shit driver recommend something like that. There are flying skills, if you could understand flying an aircraft, and that would be important also, because in this this day of drones, Okay, we're gonna be using drones in every aspect of naval warfare. So if you can learn to pilot a drone and have that type of experience under your belt and I know you'll be able to apply that and we didn't have I do not have that time that experience a technology available to me when I was growing up and just starting in my profession"
,,dan-burns,What is one question you wished you asked earlier?,"was one question I would have asked earlier. I did, Huh? I will. That's not something I was never shy about asking questions. And frankly, I have been My mile now was a CV and World War two and my older brother Waas, possibly five, at a neighbor's cat. And while the old adage is never volunteer for anything in the military, one thing I never found any hesitation. I never had any hesitation about asking a few years. Ask me senior officer's questions because A they wanted to buy you a beer. Now it is by your coffee, Okay, but you want to go and ask a lot of questions because they have for gotten war. I have got more than you have learned to date. So if anything and we learned this mentoring session go as high students, there's somebody out there they have made their mistakes, would like to pass that knowledge on to you, and I would say, Do not be afraid to ask questions. There are no dumb questions. They literally are questions because someone has done it and they don't want you to make a mistake in the future."
,,dan-burns,"As a leader, how much more will I know about the overall goals of the work I am doing?","so as a leader, how much more are you going to know about the goals of what you're doing? You are going to be pretty. You're going to be in the wardroom off your ship of your submarine of your squadron. You're going to have access to a lot of possible materials and understand admission. Envisioning the commanding officers stand wars, so you'll have a lot of access to that information. And then you gotta you gotta read, you've got a devour. You've got to understand it because other people have been asking you. Hey, what are we doing today? Uh, we're refueling. Okay. Hey, we've got to get this water underway and embark on the Reagan. Um, so a lot of that is going to be so a lot. That is classified. Yes. Any ship movement is frankly, classified. Information goes back to World War two adage. Loose lips sink ships, so you're gonna have a lot of access to information. That is possible. Um, and then you have to remember to keep it classified and remember who you're talking to. Remember that there are parts of the ship that are skiff secret compartmented information facility. Okay. Combat and very much so. You know, the engineers are not cleared for classified information. It's outsiders all clear for information. You, as a leader, have to make sure you remember who you're talking to."
,,dan-burns,What was the most difficult part of your training?,"what was the most difficult part of my training? So I as a chief engineer, I chose the engineering halfway for my career. One of things about that is it's very much hands on and you have to learn the hands on. You have to see. I had to see it way had to do a lot of cutaways off the gas turbine engines to see what the airflow waas is and how you could generate the power to the gas turbine and how it goes from the gas turbine engine room away through the whole year away out of the propeller that moves the ship that you go from standing still to 32 knots at flank speed 32 knots in about 40 miles an hour. You could do that in under a minute. With a gas turbine ship. You've got to keep all that information in your head and how to do that. The same thing could be applied through cyber attacks for the operations officer for the cryptologist. How do you maintain you've got to go ahead"
,,dan-burns,"You are having a conflict in the first few days in your unit, Is that normal or no ?","So if you're having a conflict in the first few days of the unit, is that normal? Maybe remember that there are two different fleets. Fleet on the Pacific Fleet. So is it normal? Not particularly. But could there be differences? Most definitely. There are differences. And when you go from one squadron to another swatter, when you go from the training school to the actual deployed water, yeah, there's gonna be a little bit of a difference. And that's where using officer, junior or senior grade officer, You're just going to get acclimated in that first couple of days and understand. So one of these is that I would most definitely advise. Okay, when you attempted to say, Well, we didn't do it on our last ship That way, that's true. But you're not on your ship. You're on. So you've got to adjust to your ship, and that's the thing I expect. Change. Expect there to be differences. You've got the skills to go ahead and perform. So remember, for the most part, all ships go all planes go. We'll go for so you might be tempted. Do you think I didn't do that on my last ship? You know your last ship, You don't do shit. And that's the way you're gonna perform on your new ship. Going forward on the journey protected a nation on the mission."
,,dan-burns,How you can lead honorably?,"How can you lead on? Um what a way to put that is how could you not lead honorably? One thing the capital right now is very divisive. That's the capital. It's like you. It's your ship. Such as water is that you're suffering. You need to leave honor, but you need to leave your men and women that are assigned to your command. You will. Easy. There's an old adage about get up each morning. You look at the guy in the glass guy or the gal in the glass yourself in the mirror, you say, What can I do better this day? Okay. I act with honor integrity. I will get you through your day. Yes. Well, tribulations, trials. We'll get through the day. Okay? You take short cuts with your honor and integrity. They will catch up to you. Sooner or later, they will catch up. Don't be tempted. Don't go to the dark side. Stay in the light. Stay with an act with your honor. Integrity"
,,dan-burns,"What are some good resources to look at before starting (books, videos, classes)?","It's a good resource is to look at while starting out. Remember, the chief of Naval Operations? See, you know, has his recommended reading list. Secretary of Defense. I have not seen his reading list lately because the Secretary of Defense is acting at this point, but he will come out with his reading list. And most of the admirals and generals Common war. You know, we'll have a reading list. Okay, I read that. Okay. Uh, General Patton War to General Patton. What he wanted to West Point Had he survived a war to be sent back there. Leave West Point General one everyone to study history, history. History was not interested in engineering. And that's that's very fascinating to hear from General Patton because he is the one that learned on his own how to move a tank. And that was a technological innovation from one World War two. Let's create everything else was built around the tech. He learnt the tank and yet he professes history. Read your history, learn the art of warfare because with every new technological innovation, you still have to have men and women behind that innovation. To implement a strategy to implement the art of warfare that has a change. So study warfare, study your tactics, study your procedures, learn those"
,,dan-burns,What is critical to review when you start on a new ship?,"So what is critical to review when you start a new tour on your ship, when you walk up the brow and get you a new ship, one thing that the commanding officer always has is his standing orders. And before you're gonna be qualified as an officer, that import or the also the deck underway or the tactical action officer you lost the watch, you're going tohave to know the commanding officers standing orders. This is vitally important because these are his one on one directions to you to tell you. Call me if this happens. Okay? Most easiest thing. One thing is commanding officer to the bridge. Okay, Trust made commanding officer will get to the bridge. Really? When that war goes out over the sea? Because he knows. And he will trust you if you have. If you delay calling the commanding Austin the bridge, that's what happens in the McCain. McCain got in trouble. Manning officer did not get to the bridge. So commanding officers standing orders number one thing that you need to read. In fact, if you're going to a new ship, you might want to ask the exact, you know, can I get a copy off the commanding officer standing orders before you even get there. Hey, that shows that you're being aggressive. You're leaning forward in the saddle and you want to see his standing orders. Now, in addition to that, each night underway are the commanding officer's night orders on the night waters are equally important. It lays down step by step. Okay. When to call the captain for any situation. Okay, if there's a contact bearing down on you, what's known as CVD are constant bearing. Decreasing range. You've got some unidentified contact coming down straight at you. Captain wants to know every commanding officer wants to know. When that situation happens. There's a few other situations in there. Hey, we're gonna be refueling tomorrow morning. So on the night watch, we've got a fake out all the hoses on the port side and make sure that we're ready to receive lines and liners, you know, probably at oh, dark 30 in the morning and the standing orders will lay those out. So those two things that you could be from familiarize yourself with that pair you and make you a better also going to get a new command"
,,dan-burns,Describe your ideal team.,"So my ideal team as a division officer, first aboard the ship, trying to carry out the mission for the Army head. Excellent. Captain. My ideal team is working with my chief petty officer. Seems petty Officer in the past, I had actually, on my first ship, I had a Master Ji Petty officer working. Okay? He helped me. Extremely. So it was important to establish a rapport, establish a relationship with Chief Petty officer and carry out a mission in my ambulance. That's I was engineering. Also watch. So I had to qualify. So I hasn't used my experience, my knowledge, my training to get qualified. As you turn off the watch, you walk all the decks of the engineering plant, understand it, casually patrol drills and rely on my chief to make sure that I understood how all the technology works. How old personnel fit into our division. Our team. So support part is too establishment poor with your cheese later on becomes your divisional officer. After that, you're always has it. It's It's very simple to do that, and it's very howling when and if that goes south, okay, because it was south, and you're not gonna have been having everything yourself. Don't do that. Highly recommended that I recommended establishing for you, Chief, you'll have a great yeah."
,,dan-burns,What things do you always make sure to lead by example on?,"my time is a junior officer. How I lead by example was multiple ways, but I sure believe getting out standing watches. We had long underway watches 68 hours at a shop, going down and tracing the system's understanding with men. Women are doing on the watch in the engineering holes. And I would walk with that a lot of times I would just walk Dex. See what the mission Waas. What is the messenger of the watch you go call down to a woman should go down to after steering. Don't slough it off. What? Someone else? Do it. Pick up the wash law and go stand the watch. Go and stand the death. You see, a lot of times you just go back to your stable and call it a night. Or you could take one more hour down to engineering. Walk with Dex department head. No, no. This is, for example, of division officers, but has a department head as chief engineer was able one time walk down. And I have no doubt that you know, one of my head the officers had been working on trying to solve exactly problem for about three hours. He was down there a while himself, so I spent another two hours with. So he was there for five hours while I was at two hours, five hours. I fry, we finally got it right. Got it figured out we got settles and putting out expected. Sounds strange that it was supposed to deliver. It was a matter of getting the right gaskets and over things in place at Matt 0.1 of the master chief's that was on coming watch comes down, finds out you've been here. I just spent two hours in four a gang room, you know, he was not the best tree was like the fact that I had done a very much admired if I was very upset that the chief engineer was wandering around the space is high school metal. Love that. Men chief engineer took out time. It could've been topside. He had been in the lodge where he could have been elsewhere doing things, but I took time out. I always take a time out to see what your engineers doing See with the boasting nature to take time to walk around management by walking out and be W. That will get you a lot off traction with your division"
,,dan-burns,What are some tips to earn the trust of my team?,"it's junior officer aboard your ship before it's gonna be very important for you to earn the trust and respect of men and women in your division. One of the easiest things to do for that is to get up. Get out of your state, out of the water, Out of a longer go along the debts off your personnel, Go follow the messages of the watch. And I'm not just talking about your initial qualifications that you would have to do is part of your peak US, your personal qualifications stand personal qualifications system, US points. Am I talking about getting points? I'm talking about getting up and you know you want to turn in for the night. You got one more hour of rack time or do you want to go walk to death? You'll find the message of the watch will climb down light mine shaft bearing, you know, go take the loot wall temperatures. Okay. And do that for everyone. Chef. Bearing on your ship, that is easy. Just walking the deck management by walking around, walking around and checking out on what you're moving. So you actually learn it's important for you to learn your ship. Every ship is different to lead out a little bit different. All of ships line. They're supposed to be laid out the same, but some are not. It is you're in from bad it is. You have to go down to a given space and check something else with flooding damage control. The only way to do that is by walking around. What better way to hurt? You know, trust and respect of your personal else by walking it with another example You give not a divisional officer level, but a za chief engineer. We're getting ready to launch the RHIB and your every ship will have away boat. In this case, most of them are The Ridge Way had just gotten to the ships. So we had to launch the RHIB, while part of a few of us for that is you tested once. Well, there's a conflict in the instructions. The post in base at just the engine. What a gas. The plant maintenance system is Do not test. Without water forming on the most middle watch could have damaged the ship. Once that was explained to may, we wrote a procedure to take care of that and get it. And the A gator Very happy for you that the ship won't be damaged. Everything And that he put the word out. The engineer stuck on for the egg angers over with Postmates. So engineers win. Engineer Score one. Most amazing. So I was for my dough, But just there's gonna be a lot of examples. Where? Mushroom walking a while. You won't find these examples. If you stay in your state grow if you stay in the wardroom. Okay. You're not gonna want your shit. You're not gonna that it is not a good way to start your career. You want to walk around, You want to know your ship, You want to know?"
,,dan-burns,How do you connect more deeply with your team members?,"the easiest ways to connect with team memories because you warrant officer and they are listed easiest ways is to stand the watch with them. You're going to be in a rotation picked out by other, your head or the senior watch officer. You've just got to stand that watch as questions, see what they do, understand what the personnel are doing, what their mission is. He's respected. Watched what is the message we watched? What's his engineering? Also watched it. One That's a tactical action. Also, what does the missile control off you need? Thio. As you're standing here on watch, you're gonna stand them day in, day out. That's the easiest way to earn back your trust and figure out what you could do better. But if you just go to sleep or your your watches or four awful watch, or don't pay attention to the lodge that will be noted in, the personnel will not want to stand a watch with you"
,,dan-burns,"How do I build trust between different team members (e.g., new ones, ones with bad interactions)?","Now I live build trust with my team, and 40 team member or team members had a stumble. You know, the easiest things to do is just standing watch, doing drills. Just continue to do trust if you get the trails. Right. Okay, then everybody's happy. Hey, I want to be part of that watch, too. The lieutenant has his crap. One sock on. That's that's That's the guy. Now I wanna follow. Okay, if you're having multiple failures on the drills and, uh, everybody's gotta do it again because of a drop, we didn't get the torpedo fired off on time because the total rage sent the wrong signals in that were misinterpreted and sold. Are you going to do that? Is to continuously do every day import, doing a fire every day in court. You going to do intruder alert drills? So if you're the guy that's looked at the gala, it's looked at too, You know, I want to be on that team, right? Okay. If you've got a new person on the team that you need to work in, you know, or with you have him. Are the new team member walking here? You then can evaluate. Remember the new team members capabilities, and you can figure out where that person will fit and or if you need to do more drills."
,,dan-burns,What are good strategies to have the right kind of presence with my team?,"you know, I was reloading strategies for you to be present with your team. You know, the books will have all kinds of recommendations for personally in my time. And I had read a lot way had a lot of leadership examples falls, but I still think the easiest one is VW A management by walking around that shows that your present hey, in your state room, if you stay in, the longer you stay in the wardroom of the bridge, don't get down to your spaces. Okay? That's gonna be noticed. So the best way to be present is to be brother, go out and walk the decks with your team with your master chief Petty officer with your leading petty officer. Get out and about because they're also help you one. When you push report to the ship, that's the best thing to do. Walk around with everyone in the chain of command, okay? And see it and try to understand where all your Spence is off because again they are all your spaces and so you don't want to miss it space. So the best way to do that is to walk around with Chief Petty Officer and Petty Officer. The officer should see all your spaces. But also what? They have a point out by doing that? Yeah. When the captain turns over the ship that he has to turn over every space on the ship to his relief and every space just signed for Catholic. You don't want to be the officer that rules space. Oops. You That's going to get you in the hot seat really quick. So the best way to do that is to walk around."
,,dan-burns,How do you and your work colleagues socialize outside of work?,"I socialize outside of work. That's interesting. You do want to socialize with your wardrobe. I've always found that because you are one ship, one team won't wardroom my father's record Recollections by 30 year tour are the four ships work rooms and we would go up. We had a lot of parties back in the day, and also we would, uh, underway in a port way would want a much with the warder. You're really tight with your wardrobe. Now. There would be official ship's functions where you know, the division, that party, we would have to give you Christmas parties on the bigger ships. You have multiple parties, there are departments would get together. So I've done that, too. I will say 11 thing. No one really likes having to go to a party of being directed to go party. Um, so if I was the senior officer at the parties, I would arrive first, arrive on time scheduled time, but I'd also be first and but the crew party. So it's about them. You never want to be seen with dictatorial. They work for you during the day, you know, let them have their time off. And so that's a delicate balance that you have to find"
,,dan-burns,How should your relationship be with your subordinates ? (close vs. far),"my relationship with the personnel in my division departments on aboard my ships I was more of a you want to see near far I was more arms reach. You will always be, You know, Mr or Mrs Ensign, Lieutenant Commander, you're always going to be looked at as the khaki. Um, you're not with the illicit grew. And that applies even if you're a Mustang, you know, you used to be in the chief's mess. You're not in the business anymore. You're in the wardroom. And that implies, you know, you want to know what your people, what their families are. You know Who's the wife? That song, his daughter's college. Any special needs would be aware of that and be able to talk to a person. Be personal. You don't want to be seen as a machine or a robot like that. But at the same time, you need to keep a hand at arm's reach because we are in the professional arms way. Our men, women, how about arms? And there's going to be a time when you may be called upon to go in harm's way. And that is part of the good water invisible. You must be ready to execute the mission. We are combat men of arms"
,,dan-burns,"How do I help my team prepare for a tough mission (e.g., inspection, long mission)?","You know, you've got a tough mission coming up for inspection. Coming up, getting ready for deployment. You're getting ready for obvious. You're getting ready for ref trade. You get ready to go out and do the mission. It's how do you help the team get ready for that? The one be present. Do hot slough off. You know, the weekend before Monday, inspections be around, wall your decks. Tell you one for example. Not so funny at the time. I did as a captain. As a captain, I walked Dex. I had a radiological inspection coming up. I walked through my entire building. Everything's good to go. Everything's labeled. Did I know that the contractors were coming in to eat the whole pits that weekend? No. No, I did not. What happens? Removed All exterior site Ege interests. Image from all bulkheads, all doors. So Monday morning for the radiological inspection. But I just went and seed on Friday with my own eyeballs Automatic because we don't have the radiological inspections rooms designated because the contractors took the scientist. Yeah, way fault with that. That would be more so. You know, as a captain, you keep warning. You expect what you inspect. Should I've got in on Sunday afternoon? Well, yeah, I could have done that. We fix things that we ultimately repaired and have a great expections. Yes. Okay, But if you are not present, if you do not walk the spaces, you are at risk, okay? And it's better to walk the spaces with your teeth. The personnel that are going to be showing off the spaces so as a dry run and you will have a dry run for inspection. Stash crew, team member. So what you gonna tell the inspector? He shows up. You're just asking a question. You want to know when? That way that will allow you to evaluate your team members knowledge, experience, training level. And is your she ready for the inspections?"
,,dan-burns,What kinds of people will I work with?,"What kind of people are you gonna work with in our navy? In our department of defense, you're gonna work with every okay, um, President Johnson integrated the navy. Good. Um, in place, everyone in navy. That's not a problem. It's your responsibility to work with every man and woman. That's society. And and you took it both of office to defend. The Constitution says America you don't get to choose you're going to work for at both is your goes to work for and with everyone that is on your unit on your so you gonna run across the gamut. This is why it's always good to Okay, we won't get old leadership movies wise. Why is the captain do it that way in the Indies? Reagan Lady, you've got to understand. You know I don't want to do that. Is to return to look into understand, okay?"
,,dan-burns,What kinds of people respond better to certain leadership strategies?,"running your ship strategies. You're going thio counter all types out there. So everything you've been talking to, this point you're gonna use at some point in time the guy you're gonna you can use one thing that that you gotta remember at the end of the day, you are still in charge. It's a lawful order carried out. And when it comes down to that, okay, if that means you finally have to you're exasperated internally, you know, when you're done and now you're just gonna save because that is illegal. I've given you a legal order, carry out the order not to carry out the order. Then there's going to be consequences Just going too fast. It's gonna be executive also investigation ex alive, baby, you don't want to build their you know early. You don't want to have a rush to judgment. You wanna try toe have resolve the situation with every leadership skills and you would use that during your time with routine, especially as officer, but you don't need to enjoy it. Every day is going to be different and every day there will be a new challenge. Every day you get way up and figure out how you're going to execute the mission"
,,dan-burns,When is it a good idea to share personal stories or emotions with members of your team?,"you know what is it a good time? Thio express personal relationships or personal history with your team. Let's say you can always go have a cup of coffee with you leading to Petty Officer dolls are leading any officer you know, within the first week when you're trying, when you got a board and you spied harm, head to your team. Okay? You're going to sit down, have a cup of coffee and discuss, You know, the past Would you believe is the person you need to know is the person who you believe is that person still aboard the ship? If the person is still aboard the ship, you need to know that. So you could go ask that person. What did he or she like? What he or she accomplished what he or she leave unaccomplished. You're going to arrest. Get it out. You'll only find that out by talking to you. We didn't You, Betty? Awesome. So that's one of things that you could dio is is talk to them"
,,dan-burns,What counseling skills are important?,"right. How's Ling? This is important part of the job that you're going. Some people like this People considered positive. I just completed Considered it part off the child. I have Thio counsel most times is it now you don't want to get to be, you know, gracious in or out of boys and disease. I was used to be stingy in war with that hard on the team because you don't want to be I And then this way people will understand that your fair leader And that's your only when you come out and say that we don't wrong, they understand. But don't forget to make sure people know when they've done a good job. I wanna hear you want if you want to hear that you want and that's your team, that you're responsible"
,,dan-burns,How do I push my team to meet the standards? (if they are having trouble meeting them),"I first team to meet standards. This is one of the times when it's gonna depend on the situation. Tell you that one team that I had to leave was on that ship sailed. George here's actually fired What I was saying. So at that point, the team is gonna have to do it my way. My way is by the book. My way was to get help in and make sure that we were using the mobile training teams eyes who carried out the exercises, any equipment to speed. Make sure that we understood technology and carry out drills on time. That was a long slog. It was a very long fight to do that. I can tell you that at the end of the day should earn the engineer. He learned that 12 years, Ali. The only trophy that was in the days when only one ship this water was a fleet of ships. So does depend on the situation. If you're more than a situation where teams right. You have a copy on just past Raftery. Everything's great. They built with Sanders. Just stay up on that Raiders ej, stay tight. Stay sharp, Okay? Don't slack off"
,,dan-burns,How should you reward your sailors for good performance?,"How do you reward your team for outstanding performance? One. Import that off. That last thing you could do? Um what the chief? Let the senior chief Petty officer leave. Patty Oscar made recommendations on who's performed for who deserves a 72 hour liberty chip. Good. Get them out, Go up to the apartment and say, Hey, I want to give the master chief a day off next morning. On what? The master chief Have 72 hours being re card for the weekend. That's one of you. Yes, you can write up awards for your division. Good. They are be conservative in handing out the awards because you don't want to be seen as someone that's always riding up in a war. Just giving him out like they're You know, Wally Pops, Then then the value of the ward is not going to help me. It's gonna have a victorious facts because everyone wants the scout one. Everyone's got one most about so awards and liberty time outstanding. That's that's the one thing that you can do for your teeth"
,,dan-burns,"What traits and experience, do you look for when interviewing new team members?","has devoted all. Sir, you're going to have new team members reporting aboard this ship, This water to the organization. So things that you want to look at is where does the person on the team? Shit. Okay, what MLS is, does this person have? Where in the Manning document does he or she fit? If I need a SAR swimmer and the sewer swimming school is only offered, you know, semi annually. And I report that three star swimmers aboard the ship okay? And this person is reported to me as a star swimmer, but hasn't been to this girl. Okay, Now I have to make sure that he or she has had time and reported in route to coming to my team. Does he have time? She had time to get this article. By the way, when you get those orders and you're looking at your team rotations, start swimming School is very important for the chef way. Need somebody out there? That's your responsibility. It's not the person. It's your responsibility to make sure that you have the full complement of people. You need to carry out the mission. So you know what's Our swimmer is leaving make sure you've either identified a new person coming of war to go on, be sold for You have identified someone else within the team to go to saw school and become. The ships are sworn now I've since our swimmer, but that applies for a majority of multiple off unless it's within the ship."
,,dan-burns,How should your relationship with you're the people in charge of you ?,"Yeah. You're reporting to see you're something. You're Katie Command. But that's how you really should be with the people in charge of you. So how should your relationship being with change your reporting, seniors? Fact that that is important. Because day in, day out, you're gonna see that. You see, with 40 quarters, you're gonna see a meal hours in the wardroom. You can see at the colors that this same standing watch, you see general quarters. So you have to have a professional yourself. It has to be a professional relationship with a good relationship with her. But you can come in and say So you talked to you? I have a situation that I have not experienced.

,,dan-burns,How long does it take to complete your training for OOD (officer on the deck) underway?,"so complete my training o D. Under way. It's going to vary because you have to be on your way and it depends where you hit the ship and its ashore and see cycle patient. So if you report to a ship in the shipyard, that's you. Awhile you report to the ship while she's on deployment. That's great. Personally, I met my ship on the deployment. I was able to qualify for Yau in 81 days. And then there was just not enough time to go topside and qualified. So then we went to the shore rotation and we were 44 year before we deployed again. I qualified for my also south. I'm assuming this is Austin that underway. Also, that underway requires a year A good, solid year off Underway time doing all the evolutions. Okay, that means, you know, anchoring. That means unwraps, refuelings, etcetera, etcetera mo board, etcetera. Personal transfers. So 30 year qualifies. Also that import two weeks, two weeks"

You're in a smoke free and 80 for the most part underway. And you're a drug free navy other way. I could tell you what I joined the Navy in 1984 on a bitch of a neighbor, one that was not got the goods. There was a rapid produce from the Vietnam era. Ships could not get underway, and that was a problem. So see, you know at that time ordered zero tolerance for drugs and we started kicking people out and kick him out. We did that. So we had a drug for your name. And now it's very interesting that medical marijuana is allowed in a bunch of states at this point. Medical marijuana, though, is not allowed in our navy. So that's gonna be a challenge for you knew. And I'm sure those challenges coming. Okay. But we cannot have officers or enlisted on our ships that are medically, medically on allied. A walk that was not really saying I need my medical marijuana. Well, you don't need to be a baby. That that's the kind of challenges at our home in your face"
,,dan-burns,What is the most challenging part about your job?,"the most challenging part of the most challenging part of my job. A Z division officer was trying to work the ship itself and word where I fit in that mission and one of the people that were around don't do it says about three, most or so before you're totally comfortable. You say, If I got lots and watches per se unless you off ship second, culpable with the ins and outs of your ship learning, Just get around your shit. That's always what you do."
,,dan-burns,What is the biggest failure you ever had and what did you learn from it?,"that I had in my career or the U. S s life. You had a sore. I was the simmering surface warfare officer, and we were on their way in the Barents Sea on way took a rogue wave over the bridge and Salah rupture. It ruptured right at a point where, in the latest X rays, we had what was noticed, as some are catastrophic tears in the higher in think of your are you positive tire? Sorry. Entire ship and wait. It is Well, I was not very comfortable doing that because we had to go into the dry dock in your shoes and replace the solar way we were off live a mission. Warfare out 85 days trying to get the sword dome out, foldout replaced, going inspection, and they're trying to figure out who's responsible. Okay, so I was a time in my career, I can tell you is I had er well documented. The tear in the solar had noted everywhere, and I see said, Well, there happened where? You know Ben 11th noticed. Noted it in the logs. So therefore, you know, active God, It felt I couldn't wash that could've thrown drum me out of it, said it was all, like, false. But since I had the foresight to look at it, notice it and say, Hey, it wasn't prepared in the previous upgrade. You know, I got lucky on that road, so I knew my would do the strengths, weaknesses, threats to my foot."
,,dan-burns,How accepting of failure is this work environment when a good and honest effort was made?,"So I would like to say that way are in not in a zero defect navy right now, So I'm not sure that that is the case. I don't think that's ever been the case. Not as accepting of failures. Um So to avoid that, you have to do as many drills as many run throughs practice around this dry run scenario planning et cetera that you could possibly think of. This is where the aviators have it over us. Where they could do the simulators can just fly the simulator, fly the simulator, fly the simulator. I have been told that the pilots that flew the J 35 simulators blow That's got, you know, absolute a number one scores. Where then had the least crashes off the aircraft when they were finally giving. So run your drills. One you're acting in a decade. Be part of that personally, as ah, Chief imaginary officer, I was always the number one nozzle man going to the fire. I always wanted to know how hot it got in those fires and great legs. That's where we went in my time for 55 trained, and you want to know what your body, Teddy, when you have to go without a fight, So what do that by doing? So do thrills. Try to figure out what you can do that will help you be prepared for those zeros effect mentalities that you're gonna be facing."
,,dan-burns,What are sources of support when you took a chance and the result was poor?,"You know, sometimes you are gonna take a chance in the Navy and try to figure out one way to do something, and then it's gonna go south South. Jay Command is responsible because it happened on their watch as well as you watch. But the first foremost take responsibility for it. Yep. It's a simple I lost the aircraft I had to pull. I had to reject. Okay. All right, we'll figure it out. They'll get the black box, they'll figure out what's gonna happen."
,,dan-burns,What is your least favorite food?,"dude, that's like police is the name Nell. I don't think I've had a mango. And for these six years, it's on the story behind that that you might imagine It has to do with the U. S s R food service officer who you got to read the rates on the way from the GOP's way home. He ordered enough mangles for the entire crew greens that were more of us. Unfortunately, war ship just a company that is raised in block award. And when we pull into Hawaii, we had to offload all fresh fruits and vegetables that did not originate in the United States territory. Which man? I also figured this out Loser was awesome loss. What also figured this out? Six days with sewage. We had a little affection with me. Call. Oh, my go express. We had I didn't know you could make it angle, Sheiks Angle gets right. My booze and rights. Oh, yeah. So we were in India caving in millions in Officer. I did my best. Actually, I have not had a mango since, Uh,"
,,dan-burns,"How does someone recover from a professional ""bump in the road""?","it was one to recover from a professional bumping. So you try not to be zero defect. We try very hard. That means you're gonna make the states. So the first thing is usually sitting top going. Remember that? Well, you do. You've got to get back in the saddle. You've got to get back up. You gotta try it yet you were going to be doing for ship's officers. You're going to be doing bullshit alongside station keeping. Do not hit the other ship. What was her shoot? Times that we have available did that, especially with the way refuelings. So you've got to rehearse it in your mother. You've gotta find time to go up on the bridge, Wayne, or on the Flying Bridge. Look down and watch this. Watch someone do the evolution so you could have it fresh in your mind when your turn comes to do a calling exercise. So this thing when you do have a bump in the road a acknowledge it for training will evaluate the situation. Do not fight it. Do not fight that you what last one shouldn't want, right? Just acknowledge that you did for whatever and correct it the next time corrected in training. Your engineer gotta do qualify as an engineer. Awesome. Watch. Just do another engineering drill. Get held in here at making part of muscle. Okay, this is what I have to do. That means acknowledging estate getting up, doing it again."

I am told that my phone Walser is going. There's a storm or out for as long as 12 to 14 months. So all that is as herself did not know how long you're going to be out in away from your family. Um, that that it's our solved that and say motivated and keep your, you know, on the glory is stayed. You don't have to come now she's got to be"
,,dan-burns,How do you deal with stress on the job?,"I deal with stress. All the job. Um, personally, I'm a pig.

Four oak leaves on it, which says, for two years, fully deployed away from the country with my family, with my whole underway at sea, Another year in hand. So, technically, I was away for three years from the States. Anywhere. What thing is, uh, nice worshipped robbery at night. You look up with the stars, you can see the stars.

,,dan-burns,How do you handle fatigue at work?,"so fatigued work. And it does happen. You know, uh, it's they say that the navy runs on coffee. Yes, all are smaller. That war to be over. Ladies on. Personally, I was always a great judge of bad coffee because we didn't have a Starbucks on four of my ship, actually, for my ships, we didn't at Starbucks. You could maybe go to a start. But we have Starbucks stuff on fancy electrolytes and all that good stuff. So we'll handle fatigue. It goes back to the old phrase of our wooden ships. You have to be in shape here after coffee. Uh, you have to watch yourself whatever it takes advising anyone to beat to crap out of themselves and slot before you know you're trying to stay off Wait. Especially if you're on the bridge and you've gotta watch you paddle a lion to stay away to get up to get the next watch. Believe it because you have 300 souls depending upon you and your judgment. And if you run the ship aground, wanted to ship because you're tired loads is well, excuse it all, so drop and give me another 20 on I stay away. The best you can. Let's go.

Button operated on the main missions of shit is what? Well, ops. You have to have a working day. Everyone was worried. Probably a little coin. Nazi, actually, engineers got a plan. They fixed it. Okay, Have a question for it. Uh, who signed off on that ship? Who accepted that? Show us. Oh, yeah. Don't be a Nazi. I'm thinking he didn't send the same engineers out fixing that signed off on. So no way. No. We need to get You have to understand"
,,dan-burns,How do you deal with an increase in tempo?,"when the ops tempo increases. First, foremost get the word out to your team. To division should stop. Would where we wanted to get the word out because no one wants You need a pair of people, so they could be ready to ramp up to it. And there are going to be okay. We're going to be doing unwrapped tomorrow morning, followed by a refueling. Okay, there we go. All right, The plane. Our house. Okay, that's high up step over that day. I sure hope it's a Saturday, so I could take off on some day. You have a light duty day on Sunday, but you can't tell on some days at sea being a day off. Hopefully, there are some times, hopefully something you cooked up, you could wind up spending Sunday afternoon in the Bering Sea. And they always over on the bridge, which based not taking off on Sunday. You try to make sure that the ship, um it's red and obstinate. Bo doesn't change this ship. Appreciator machinery. Yeah, off.

Okay, that, you know, suddenly long Division four. You know, there were roses. Whoa, That's a problem. So sexual harassment thing. You also need to watch out when you come back from deployment the ship, the crew and wave me. That's heads for 468 old doesn't you know? Okay. Hey, just a leading member of the opposite sex that goes into play. You gotta watch out. Um, you have resources available to you. Uh, when you coming back from deployment, state troopers would be flown out to the air out of her on his griefs to all the ships, sit down and remind people are driving sexual.

,,dan-burns,"If you could change one thing about your job, what would it be?","I could have changed one thing about a job. Um, see, uh, you all right? Able to communicate as well with family that you do now, um, write letters, actually. Letters to our spouses drooling at that point. But that's on my child born, um, you know. So, um, change now that you have faced it's hard to your spouse for Mom, Dad, you know, from the middle of the Pacific. It's for Okay, we're going. You gotta worry.

,,dan-burns,Describe a time that you were put into an untenable ethical situation?,"one on. Untenable. As a gold situation, I have to deal with my 1st 06 command. I had to bring the mast. 05 Who has sexually harassed and no floor in the command? I brand new to this. This is honestly, the first day off. My and I am made aware of this, um, as they the executive officer for all That's why brought the man to last and what they're meant to be drawn. 22 a half months later, 22 out of my 24 months command. 22 a half months later, the man was drunk. Uh, so it was a highly on terrible situation that that member placed me. He wanted to talkto. Can I talk to you, Skipper? It's awful. I know what you want to talk about it. You're now commanding officer. You cannot be biased. You cannot let this untenable situation reach a point where you are going to be compromised. So I was not going a lot. Uh, five. Talk to me. And as a result that I was clear. Thio had a clear field. You too,"
,,dan-burns,How do I deal with an assignment that I don't like or that isn't a good fit?,"assignment. That is not a good fit. So, you know, we've got each command is roughly two years. We've got 10 to years commands. If you're gonna deal with 20 years, that time you're gonna after Mads that you're gonna like and have a talk myself. A 30 year career. By that logic, I had 15 commands. So roughly at 17 commands told from fuck the beginning and off the 17. There's only three of the 17 that I would say I would not go back to. I would not go back to that. I did. I hope you have a lovely like that you're joining. But when you're enduring those 3 17 are not comfortable. What? What if you will draw in the Navy to see the world have a great war? I want some fun along the way. Or are you doing frankly? What are you thinking? Deliveries. If it's a personnel offline, you or the other person is going to roll. Thank you. Your throat. Then don't watch anyone stand off two years. Frankly, if they're out of cycle means just a year before that person or persons changed out. So best thing to do at that point is, Brendan Barrett. That tour because you don't want to be labeled as the problem child. Couldn't get it done. So do your tour serve the nation? Remember, this is one of my fright. Seven things. Well, okay, that's okay. You do that because the other 14 gonna be a test. That's a pretty good bad marriage."

And these days, smartphones. The reason you get a degree, that's a lot of fun. Okay, So much. Remember, you know, you're not gonna have that much time off between watches, your standing a watch and then running your division running your department. Same. You're standing watch.

That was the most free time I've had. But I was pretty much longer. My job or I was a student at the Naval Force Graduate School."
,,dan-burns,Does being a leader give you flexiblity to alter your work schedule?,"being a leader. Give me the flexibility to alter my stable. So that's a double edged sword. Short answer is yes, George. Whole schedule. However, if you are first long bound brow a your notice, you're not gonna know the workout. So old adage that one of my executive officer passed on Waas letter What time chips were knocks off local go home. But if that means you need 5 30 the next morning. Sure, you finish the war.

,,dan-burns,"How does being a leader change your lifestyle?(frequent travel, irregular hours, family difficulties etc)","I was being later change. Lost on effect. You're in charge.

All get to go on as tenant told, move the ship. Okay. Our master came out move the ship because we were in the swing pattern for the cruise ship. That was not supposed He came in and had not moved. Uh, we probably would swap, so it's always want on. Move your ship. Your washing so you could affect your travel. You know, as tv opposition. Go on travel, travel. And I'm also saying in my time I've seen manning officers that ever left the ship that I was one of 3/2 is that I did not enjoy. I have never left his ship. Commander never made a pact on.
