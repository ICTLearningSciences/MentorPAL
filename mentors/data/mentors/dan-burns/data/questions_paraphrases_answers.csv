,,dan-burns,What is one question you wished you asked earlier?,what is one question I would have asked earlier well I did ha I well that's not something I was never shy about asking questions and frankly I've been my model that was a CV in World War two and my older brother was a class of the five at the Naval Academy and while the old adage is never volunteer for anything in the military one thing I never found any hesitation I never had any hesitation about asking juniors are asking senior officers questions because a they want to buy you a beer now it is by your coffee okay what you want to go and ask a lot of questions because they have forgotten war I've got more than you have learned to date so if if anything we learn those letters I should go ask questions there's somebody out there they have made their mistakes we would like to pass that knowledge on to you and I would say do not be afraid to ask a question there are no dumb questions there literally are all questions because someone has done it and they don't want you to make a mistake in the future

,,dan-burns,What was the most difficult part of your training?,was the most difficult part of my training so I I as a chief engineer I I chose engineering halfway form for my career there were things about that is it's very much hands on and you have to learn the hands on you have to see I had to see it we we had to do a lot of other ways of the gas turbine engines to see what the air flow walls is and how you can generate the powers of the gas turbine and how closely caster manager of all it's really cold here all the way out to look for power that moves the ship if you go from standing still two thirty two knots at flank speed over with thirty two knots about forty miles an hour and you can do that in order a minute with a guest or which you've got to keep all that information in your head and and how to do that the same thing could be applied through cyber attacks for the operations officer for the cryptologist how do you maintain if you've got to go ahead and see all

(e.g., when the crew was supposed to go home but needs to stay active/at sea?)",well this sucks so on I'm sure we'll do it your phone calls so the first is to get the word out get the proper workout because there is going to be room in all all we've been extended another thirty days sixty is Hey did you hear we're going to Australia one big division officers he can do is get the right word out and then people always try to run down rumors as well one thing about that there there will never be a shortage of scrotal and we were there so one way you is by doing is is yeah getting the word out well we're not going to Australia yes we have been extended but we've only been extended by two days and okay that that helps you can get that word out yeah and then you will come though as the person that's got the scoop since got kicked out so it's got the light yeah things open you know sharks you know football games or the group go do something yeah they're all good to go through this is gonna be all things to getting the word out of civil suits for these people before try to plan their lives a little they have there were plenty of laws you can help 
,,dan-burns,Who are the core team members (inner circle) who you relied on as a leader?,on the most as a writer who is my court TV but I will one allied the two the that so far right a captive XO all that we can live all three systems for combat systems also for for the division also level rely on chief petty officer division for being senior at all sure yeah issue the command those are so people either directly or live on but also on so as there is new low for real and certainly the department head reporter James okay yeah that one also I would always be in touch with the fries with the supply officer this is this is also a feature he gets the parts that you need to do your mission that is a cash wrap and answer Castro well the sponsors signing off on that guy's trip as so I always got to know the supply also Michael 
,,dan-burns,"If you have trouble listening well, what strategies can help you listen well?",listening to roles you'd be issued the plan of the day and you'll be recorders and you only have a good day some some way your division will last year and some some way that day hi there your department head XO seals we'll call it as that person so what's going on today and they ask is your team member who has an the day you'd be surprised how often that happens or and eight people will complain I didn't get the word there's always so many ways to get the word out yeah for smartphones for tablets before we had a simple plan would that be right all so what they're doing and what's going on you know it's not a big change even in the smartphone era and as we get this smartphone the ambiance far from so it's still not getting here so what do you do yeah you correctly let's see the part of the day postado okay right behind me yeah one day right there those what's going on but if you haven't as division officer taking time to host the fall flat on the day yeah Paul so you need to make sure that it's available if you could point to a place that interest is in the ships one of the file it is the U. R. L. but if you can't find that your responsibility okay if you got it then they could seriously don't read it right about a talk with the chief petty also watch try to go over the better strategy what's the first thing is make sure you have posted 
,,dan-burns,What makes your leadership style unique?,a smaller version of the it's been a very for each person of course depending on your background how you can qualify you swirls so what a very pragmatic approach they would have me and I'm sure our chief engineer systems yeah so right for me users should call seven one is the ship logs on committing to its mission so that's the kind of things that make up my 
,,dan-burns,What are some of the things you do really well as a leader that someone could imitate?,well as a leader on the so it does actually for five full you live thanks to you for example officers my server was there's two else better officers to help me the division commands which well but I actually do for a little while well I'd be so fit rex writing unit the war is the official maybe language it's having quite the ropes three years yeah and you just can't give if you've got a division of armadillo or fifty personnel you can't just use one fifty doesn't work and people like trust your doctor felt let down by so writing a rap with old is more art than science it is a lot of our right and that's how you right take care right would you the other side to dissipate alright the little rubber 
,,dan-burns,What are the most important decisions that you face daily as a leader in your organization?,most of those board decisions based daily as a leader as a label also number one is knowing the status of my with your plan as a division officers and also as the chief engineer you had the local you responsible our life or you should should close for he's got the power to go for and I was responsible stem to start feels may manifest right we have to have you here so yeah knowing the status of for your appointment because frankly as in a lawsuit as the ship this way you know all the everything is not going to be one hundred percent also on there if you are a new commission check that is gonna be parts that are really broken and how is that going to affect your ability to carry out the ship's mission you have to think about that every day do I have the right technology right on the right he sees the white people carry out the mission sure

,,dan-burns,What are some secret-sauce tips for your leadership style?,for me as a service war for all zero we'll be back on thirty years and all of our troops on the old better start all the the one of the things like that there's a lesson out of my orders we should be able the pharmacy with that the analog on the last and here's a and I was with the with the thing about farm pharmacy is your father or are if you will and on a strong shoot from the hip beating it or already shop at the wall slowly of value wave or walk and also the usual you will get over it so all of the farm so chase you walking into situation sass you you guys use your head yeah about sharp force for the for 
,,dan-burns,What leadership strategies are dying out?,sure strategies are yeah first and foremost a little one strategy that is dying out that on arrival is is a they do or you know you you know you should be done with everyone and yeah how you never malls throws everyone always for inspecting expect which means that okay so you know this this yeah the end of all new with it you know I'm just going to use a new at the same time there is always with that before the marines in order yeah a lot of that that's right now on the lot levels or a problem that needed yeah sure that you shop at that's like a flow so so you can do is understand information understand the technology understand your capability to fight the mission that will mean that that we hope you get to the ship on 
,,dan-burns,What are warning signs for problems in a team?,the team that they're gonna be problems ahead rough waters ahead usually you can spot some of them if the team is not performing this mission if you can't stand to watch if the watch is not quiet okay you want a quiet walk she who bought the box to just turn over and everything happens on Saddam you switch the boilers out you switch the gas turbine generators from one hour to one bottle use your boarding number three gas turbine generator and put number one and all the way up to if the team can live very that out without significant strongly for the patient with consternation that's a problem so just a little watch which means you need to walk or stand walk a good watcher is nothing happens the point of happens that's perfect for C. as you watch all for nothing happens you execute the plan so that's perfect nothing happens 
,,dan-burns,How can you enforce the honor code?,for our photo that a world to assume that everyone had the ability vicious speeches the weather was bad yeah not everyone would be we are really not everyone's gone down the marks on them so so I but alas how you would shortly be you know honorable pleading their mission on simple expect what you personally inspects so if the next watch they were supposed to rain on you know boring number two or way off and get it ready to go online on the old for over watch and you come up for hundreds take the watch and that was about what's going on okay so it's things like that that you know of all the sudden you know things are not happy with posted that's an indication of so he had to turn around and you know for certain okay we suppose that of all the ships and boats stowed away and then everyone can go on the recall well should schools are still alive almost take the watch you can keep the watch is the still the phone so that so as an indicator it's it's hard it's it's not like the batteries log that every the suite is not the academy so but we can still expect you would for a duty honor country a lot of our ability exactly these with you 
,,dan-burns,How should I handle people who can't meet their standards?,what can I meet their standards yeah elle it is a pyramid structure that are maybe yeah if the the the the little I say about that is all the standards are laid out so hi at the right time if the person was told to locked out of the U. S. requirements for advancing to rate and take the second class exam and failed to do that although I don't like to recommend you for second class and nobody whining about that but frankly one thing that you have to watch out for is is if you do have a free or out there and then the three lows make a lot of noise and a lot of auto gravitas they usually that means someone else is picking up the slack for that person you do we that out with your chief petty officer or the division officer figure out really stand watch god to take care of the people that are a little too the only okay you've got to try to take care of 
,,dan-burns,What kinds of sailors cause problems in a team and what can you do to improve it?,sellers because problems okay this is if if there was a magic you know glass classes as you would on C. B. gory make a lot of money so but there isn't necessarily someone yeah you're gonna find them there were things about that is you want to be careful with your time this time is the one thing that you have very little of both the if you want to go try to spend ninety percent of your time on ten percent of your problem children okay what about the other ninety percent of our day so this is the the balance that you're going to have to come up with as a leader treat everyone fairly close also treat them for what if the troublemakers were out there just the LSA ignore them but be careful about the rest of the unit the rest of the division because if you wind up spending on for the one percent or you're going to use the restroom so it's a hard thing to work at balance what will pay off 
,,dan-burns,When is breaking the rules okay?,okay force the proper as you do that too never yeah we don't break the rules the goal yeah yeah the rules are there to protect you check the ship that the okay so the best thing about it all one to break the rules or break the rules look at them examine them study them and figure out the situation that requires a waiver that's your responsibility so the teams responsible it's your responsibility as a leader yeah it says we can only say you know metric units when we're gonna re fuel from the British ships do I have that you're getting probably should go get that how you getting all that you need to read the full so they know when the time comes that you do ask for waiver well you will have done that yeah past there's a pretty good offer in that 
,,dan-burns,How can I tell when someone can be influenced versus someone who won't change?,with someone spots someone so someone who want to change versus those that will check I learned that by conducting your day in day out watch you your mission we ship this water system you're only going to figure that out by interacting with the people in your watch so it is important to know that they're all personnel that you know they grew up on the analog technology now also you will be with digital it's up to you or let's say okay you guys do it's a well on you yeah yeah it's a war with the so the figure out adults the old SS or it is always one more people just it is good okay just change for all of us would say changes is J. some people are watching it and there are always on you got it hello everyone sure we do that okay machine walking with that swallowing a loss is a a by the way of rain in a new next all and that will go it's not a lie the old powers that we had and it has engine or from the people okay so so so so so do you have they're not responsible for the mission 
,,dan-burns,Tell me about a time where your priorities conflicted with the priorities of your management,with yeah they're going to call but the fact that I was struggling right now as a thirty year after the or that it was at the time but for the most part you know it also parties are are okay I have to carry out the yeah it is near the danger yeah well you know excuse at all levels it was a little for the most part I don't see doing writing officers of all sure it happened at that point you know I'm not going there you swore an oath to the constitution as is all that given by the officers one of the points so we did it all for the yeah allowed for all those alerts okay sample yeah so that comes to that you want to talk about that

,,dan-burns,What problems or warning signs should you not try to solve and refer up to specialists instead?,try to solve for the future okay this the age right now you are the best as cheerleader you're the best person in charge where all the the health of the team so what are you captain they will post graduate schools are a lot of suicide at that point maybe why okay was before okay what should be aware of your for the bill okay yeah all the sudden the other acting strange yeah I want to work for a lot of the chain of command if you have a question about anyways where they all okay divorces sadly they are able to divorce all the sudden effects person well okay spots yes the same way so mom or dad down sister or brother all the sudden the mental health aspect to it that well what the X. to the point where the Excelsior training maybe a chapel over ask questions you do not want to land on the person team member if you live on the net aka feel secure or it's going to be even worse yeah so I chose a jobs with the job of the route so so so long as we often but there's a problem that all the better way to do it and you'll get a yeah first level one that I've had one suicide or more ships will work for ships and I've had three deaths I thought we had a walk through all the personal take care of it so have to be aware 
,,dan-burns,"How do you deliver bad news, such as a family emergency?",there were the bad news Sally words in your this is gonna happen which is on the way and so when the unit is going to get some information or some more deaths in the family so it doesn't spouse child there are several what happens you know if you have the resources on board if they should be taken off at a chapel always good to have chapel way yeah a war you don't have that if the magic to the senior master chief of the yeah it is but the team member think about it and say Hey we're we're here to help yeah you know I will get a fly you back so there's a lot of resources available that's one thing that you will need to know about and we'll get into if you're the full games how are you gonna get a man woman all right well one event happens that's not the time to learn about it so we've got a spare or you know three days before yeah only the four if you look into that once you make sure you know the right if something happens

,,dan-burns,How long does it take to complete your training for OOD (officer on the deck) underway?,my train for all the other way it's going to be very because you have to weigh and it depends where you get the ship and it's you know short and see cycle HM so if you reporter ship in this regard this is the old while the reports of the ship well she's on the point that separate personally I met my ship on the point that I was able to qualify for easy our is eighty one days and then there was just not enough time to go topside a qualified so then we went to the short duration and we were there for four years before we deployed again and then I qualified for but also so I'm assuming this is all state that on your way also that on your way far as a year a good solid year of under way five doing the evolution okay that means you know anchoring that means alright refuelings etcetera etcetera mon more etcetera personal treasures so this year it is also that imports two weeks two weeks

,,dan-burns,What is the most challenging part about your job?,for the most part of my job as a division officer which was trying to do or the ship itself and word where I fit in that mission and what are the people the only people so at these we also so for your yeah into a profitable we can say yeah I got a pause and watches was a was on the ship yeah second towards you walk on what all of the is it a house of worship learning how to just get out while you're sure as always John well you could do rules for 
,,dan-burns,What is the biggest failure you ever had and what did you learn from it?,we're on board the USS five we had a sore I was the anti submarine service for for officer so so and we were all the way in the Barents Sea and we will go over a wave over the virtual and so far so sure a a brochure alright at a point where in the latest the X. ray he's we had always noticed as so microscopic tears in the order in the era of our devising a tire so basically the higher of the ship and it is all on well doing that because we had to go into the dried out in the news and replace this or so we were line for aviation as a reward for for the days or so Israeli get those are the only out for now you know it replaced and doing an inspection and they're trying to figure out who's responsible okay so are we yeah and so you is I had well documented it's hair in the solar and noted every more and that's the said while there happened where you know then telephones noticed it in the log so therefore you know act of god it felt I wish they'd be thrown draw me out of the way so that was all I fall since I have the foresight to look at it notice it and then say Hey it was repaired in the previous operate I go walking that throw so you might want the strengths weaknesses threats to life for 
,,dan-burns,How accepting of failure is this work environment when a good and honest effort was made?,we are in the market is zero defect maybe right now so I'm not sure that that is the case that's ever been the case not as accepting of failures so to avoid that you have to do as many roles as many you know one three research practice runs dry world scenario planning it cetera that you can possibly think of this is where the aviators have overalls where they can do this simple okay just fly the simulator fly the simulator fly the simulator I have been told that the pilots that flew the J. thirty five simulators bald **** got you know absolute a number one scores for then that the lease questions of their broke or they will find it give me a so one zero one you're active and that could be part of that person is chief editor and also all I was always the number one also made going so far hi I always wanted to know how hot it got in those farmers and Great Lakes that's where we want it might four of five five three if you want to know what your body can say what you have to go without a fight so we would do that is by the way so do these roles try to figure out what you can do that will help you be prepared for this zero Z. facts mentalities that you're gonna be facing 
,,dan-burns,What are sources of support when you took a chance and the result was poor?,this is your chance and then the and you know try to figure out one way or something and then it's gonna go south south J. demand is responsible because it happened on their watch as well as your watch but the first foremost take responsibility for yeah it's so simple walls the aircraft a I had the pole all I had to reject that right go figure that they'll get the black box they'll figure out what's going to happen that's all 
,,dan-burns,What is your least favorite food?,police is the email I don't think I've had a mind go in on the six years all the story line that that you might imagine it has to do with the USSR service officer after the debate the lady from the Philippines on our way home he ordered off labels for the entire crew and it's a remarkable us unfortunately for the ship ships company that is he of war all this to you we had to load fresh fruits and vegetables in our region in the United States organized its territory which is why I also figured this out loser was also all it is out six issues we had actually we call omegle express we had I didn't know you could make a little make it angle she Hey will engage yeah news in right or yeah so we meeting in only as an the officer I did my best are they I have not had a little since nineteen eighty eight

,,dan-burns,What are the things I should prioritize when picking housing?,for a housing noticeable there you know you're you're married you have kids then have you spell sorry life is always going to get you to do a little box and then as far as kids it was school districts but frankly there you can find those on the internet realtor dot com for one will tell you what the best school districts are then you just do a sort of sorts out from there and figure what works for your budget one would say they are all the dot com you can log in all kinds of parameters to shopping lifestyle coffee houses of servers that are and they'll show up on the and it also yeah yeah yeah the reason that house she because I want to pass on that one because you want to know that the your family is safe while you're gone if you happen to get assigned to oversee specifically there of the dangers and whose they are the mad or over one that is an exception and faithfully you might have a choice to live on the base I would say base housing they yeah you don't have to worry if you have a new family you got a young young children model of a solid yeah it's just takes that strain away not knowing are the city hall yeah they're gonna be safe on base housing okay
