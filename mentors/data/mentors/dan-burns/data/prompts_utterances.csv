Situation,Mentor,Utterance/Prompt
_INTRO_,dan-burns,"I am Navy Captain Dan Burns, graduates of the Naval Academy in 1984. I am a surface warfare officer Ship driver served on two ships out of the Pacific L P D and screw. It's out of hand. I went to the U S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, and after that, served on my department tours Chief engineer on a fast forget out of Charleston and on the actual USS Ticonderoga out of Normal. Oh, deployed on both of those tours with the USS Teddy Roosevelt, Natalie's on both ships and then went ashore to the awesome military affairs at Central Intelligence Agency. While there, I screamed for XO of Aegis cruisers and command of a small ship. But frankly, at that point my second child had been born and I decided to resign my active duty commission and joined the reserves. I finished out my 30 year career in the reserves. I was recalled once during that time for a total of 18 years of active duty, 12 years and reserves, and I retired in July off 2014"
