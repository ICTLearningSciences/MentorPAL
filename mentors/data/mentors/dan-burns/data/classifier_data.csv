So that's the thing about sea duty. A CZ. Always as things are gonna change, things are gonna change between your divisional officer, the former head. But as a department head, you need to use your experience from your division. Also yours. What is it like? How is it gonna play out? Um, and then on on shore duty? I personally, as unsure, did in my first short tour, you know, I was a student, so that wasn't too taxing at the Naval Postgraduate School. I just had to push myself, too. Get my A's, you know, and push on through and learn as much as I could. Um, for instance, because the degree I had was National Security Affairs television Well, not qualify me later on for my second and final active duty short tour. And that was at the hospital to your affairs at Central Intelligence Agency. And so I had to rely on my knowledge, gained, uh, from years before at a post graduate school and on my operational experience, learn how to, uh, act, you know how to translate what the fleet is doing and how to use a fleet at the awesome military affairs at the Pentagon with C i A So you're doing doing Maur cerebral work? If you will, Uh, when you get to the higher ranks and you're trying to figure out, you know, when you're at it at a combatant command, you know what exactly we want to do with the missile force, What exactly we're going to do with this submarine force? Why are we going to deploy a ballistic submarine to the specifics right now? What are the Indians and the Pakistanis? Perhaps we don't need a submarine in the Pacific. Perhaps we needed in the Indian Ocean. That's the kind of thing that you do as a senior officer is. Make these recommendations. What is the art of the possible?

I wanted to be in California, all the shit those born and raised in Brooklyn. So I took the first ship I could find out of the West Coast. After that, the detailers would call me and say, You've done a bang up job and now we've got a tour for you on the USS Fife and the life was coming out of the yards in San Diego and going to your piece. Get your pants. So that was the change of whole port, which you may or may not experience again. Your your time. So the other. In my time, there was a lot of moving around. The idea of home standing and staying in one port really wasn't a tool that was available now. They tried to keep personnel in the whole court to minimize the amount of moves, but frankly, it can be done. It has done a lot for personnel that are assigned to you. Goose get to Seventh Fleet to fifth fleet once they move you out there, they like to keep you there so they'll move your back to Goto far ahead. Schools go to XO school. Good to see old school, but they'll send you right back to you. Kuska, um and or fifth fleet war out to six. Fleet in the med. So nice thing about that, uh, Homestake pieces.

Where you gonna be? His department head. Where you gonna be? His next? That's You have to be willing to travel to the job. This is an old saying. If you're ready to travel and the ship major squadron agent job, then detailers will move you to a ship to shore command that needs you. So how do you plan that career? Well, first you do the best that you can in your current job. Try to get the best fit. You can try to get that that no one off ex assigned to the ship's crew and move on to the next ship to the next job that you wanted to. Now you want to. So, for instance, right now, in my time way changed out from the P 3 to 8. And there were a lot of pilots that were trying to qualify for the P eight so they would go ahead and get tours that would send them two squadrons with Ph. If you went to a squadron. I didn't have a P eight and you were kind of, you know, telegraphing detail, that you were terminal and you were not going to make a transition. Well, this is the thing that it requires you Joo to think about your next career. Where do you want to go on the submarine side? Do you want to stay in? The boomers will just keep on doing boomers, ballistic SSB end the ballistic, missing tours or No, I want to do a fast attack. I walk fast attacks and you want to stay with fast attacks. Logical Wheatley. Different mission sets between the boomers and the fast attacks. Whoever stay out and do the ballistic missions in protection of the nation. Fast attacks are out looking a S w looking for other submarines defending the carriers, etcetera, etcetera. So it requires 44 on you. What do you want to do with your career? And then one of the things you want to do is while you're on your tour president who are doing a great job, you want to go ahead and find out as much information as you can. All right? Since you want to go ahead and talk to ah Boomer. Skipper, If you're fast that well, you're on a fast cycle. Or if you're on a boat, breathe and talk fast attack and vice versa. So one of the things is when you do come in from being out at sea, there's a tendency to goto four. Go to the four winds. And you know what? You really want to try to go to some of the command functions and try to go and see Talk about Hey, what is that? What is that squadron doing? What is that shit? Do it. Where? What's his? Ever.

And so I learned a lot, and we had four years of practice, and we have summer cruises at the Naval Academy. That was very important to help me, uh, get along. I know that some while our fellow officers, um, they wish they had dunmore scuba to prepare for being a seal for to prepare them to be buds. Um, 80 years, there was some time at the academy that would've been available to me to go the flying club and a couple private pilot's license. No, I didn't do that for some of the shit driver recommend something like that. There are flying skills, if you could understand flying an aircraft, and that would be important also, because in this this day of drones, Okay, we're gonna be using drones in every aspect of naval warfare.

And that's where using officer, junior or senior grade officer, You're just going to get acclimated in that first couple of days and understand. So one of these is that I would most definitely advise Okay, when you attempted to say, Well, we didn't do it on our last ship That way, that's true. But you're not on your ship. You're on. So you've got to adjust to your ship, and that's the thing I expect. Change. Expect there to be differences. You've got the skills to go ahead and perform.

I have not seen his reading list lately because the Secretary of Defense is acting at this point, but he will come out with his reading list. And most of the admirals and generals Common war. You know, we'll have a reading list. Okay, I read that. Okay. Uh, General Patton War to General Patton. What he wanted to West Point Had he survived a war to be sent back there. Leave West Point General one everyone to study history, history. History was not interested in engineering. And that's that's very fascinating to hear from General Patton, because he is the one that learned on his own how to move a tank. And that was a technological innovation from one World War Two. Let's create And everything else was built around the tech. He learnt the tank, and yet he professes history.

s001p006s00161012e00191100,,"So what is critical to review when you start a new tour on your ship, when you walk up the brow and get you a new ship, one thing that the commanding officer always has is this standing orders. And before you're gonna be qualified as an officer, that import or the officer of the deck underway or the tactical action officer you lost the watch, you're going tohave to know the commanding officers standing orders. This is vitally important because these are his one on one directions to you to tell you. Call me if this happens. Okay? Most easiest thing. One thing is commanding officer to the bridge. Okay, Trust made commanding officer will get to the bridge. Really? When that war goes out over the sea? Because he knows. And he will trust you if you have. If you delay calling the commanding Austin the bridge, that's what happens in the McCain. McCain got in trouble. Manning officer did not get to the bridge. So commanding officers standing orders number one thing that you need to read. In fact, if you're going to a new ship, you might want to ask the exact, you know, can I get a copy off the commanding officer standing orders before you even get there. Okay, that shows that you're being aggressive. You're leaning forward in the saddle and you want to see his standing orders. Now, in addition to that, each night underway are the commanding officer's night orders on the night waters are equally important. It lays down step by step. Okay. When to call the captain for any situation. Okay, if there's a contact bearing down on you, what's known as CVD are constant bearing. Decreasing range. You've got some unidentified contact coming down straight at you. Captain wants to know every commanding officer wants to know. When that situation happens. There's a few other situations in there. Hey, we're gonna be refueling tomorrow morning. So on the night watch, we've got a fake out all the hoses on the port side and make sure that we're ready to receive lines and liners, you know, probably at oh, dark 30 in the morning and the standing orders will lay those out.

My ideal team is working with my chief petty officer. Seems petty Officer in the past, I had actually, on my first ship, I had a master chief Petty officer working, and he helped me extremely. So it was important to establish a rapport, establish a relationship with Chief Petty officer and carry out a mission in my ambulance. That's I was engineering. Also watch. So I had to qualify. So I hasn't used my experience, my knowledge, my training to get qualified as off the watch, all decks, all the engineering plant, understand it casually control drills and rely on my chief to make sure that I understood how all the technology works and how old personnel fit into our division.
