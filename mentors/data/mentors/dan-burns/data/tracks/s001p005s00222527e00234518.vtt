00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.000
So with any job, with any profession, any career, there are going to be

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.140
 something. So one of the things up A night it is the long underway

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:19.290
 tours. So I thought I was away for, uh, 6 to 8 months. Once I was waiting

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:25.440
 even longer. My first child, my daughter, was born two weeks

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.580
 before my ship got underway for deployment. A little baby girl was born

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:37.730
 no bigger than my forearm, but her and her mother on a plane stay

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.880
 with her mother in Pebble Beach, California and I went and I deployed

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:50.030
 for 10 months. So sea duty. It is very hard not only on yourself

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.170
 on the family very hard, and that's one of things that you know. It's

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.320
 a it's a negative, but you've got to figure out a way to deal with

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.470
 that. And you've got to be very reticent about you know, your your

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.610
 your time there, and you've got to be very old bit with your spouse

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.760
 and with your family about what it takes to be a naval officer
