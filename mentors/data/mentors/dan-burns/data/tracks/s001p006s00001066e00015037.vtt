00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.720
So what skills? What I like to have mastered before my profession. Um

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.580
 um Naval Academy. And so I learned a lot, and we had four years of practice,

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.450
 and we have summer cruises at the Naval Academy. That was very

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:24.310
 important to help me, uh, get along. I know that some while our

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:30.180
 fellow officers, they wish they had dunmore scuba to prepare for being

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.040
 a seal for to prepare them to be buds. Um, eight years, there was

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.910
 some time at the academy that would've been available to me to go the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.770
 flying club and a couple private pilot's license. Now, I didn't do

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.640
 that for some of the shift driver recommend something like that. There

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.500
 are flying skills, if you could understand flying an aircraft, and

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.370
 that would be important also, because in this this day of drones

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:11.230
 Okay, we're gonna be using drones in every aspect of naval warfare.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:17.100
 So if you can learn to pilot a drone and have that type of experience

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.960
 under your belt and no, you'll be able to apply that and we didn't

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.830
 have it. I do not have that time that experience that technology available

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.690
 to me when I was growing up and just starting in my profession
