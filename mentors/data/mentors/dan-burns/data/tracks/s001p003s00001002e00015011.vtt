00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.110
so it's skills when I've lied to have mastered before my profession Naval

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:13.360
 Academy and so I learned a lot and we have four years of practicing

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.620
 at the summer cruises at the Naval Academy that was very important

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:25.870
 to help me get along I know that some of my other fellow officers

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:32.130
 they wish they had done more scuba to prepare for being a seal war

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.380
 to compare them to be **** aviators there was some time at the academy

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:44.640
 that would have been available to me to go the flying fault and pick

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.900
 up a private pilot's license well I didn't do that or so the ship

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:57.150
 driver and something like that there are flying skills if you can

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:03.410
 understand flying an aircraft and that would be important also because

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:09.660
 in this this Dave drones okay we're gonna be using drones in every

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.920
 aspect of naval warfare so if you can learn to pilot a drone and have

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.170
 that type of experience under your belt and know you'll be able

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.430
 to apply that and and we didn't have the I do not have that time the

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.680
 experience of technology available to be when I was growing up and

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.940
 and just starting in my profession
