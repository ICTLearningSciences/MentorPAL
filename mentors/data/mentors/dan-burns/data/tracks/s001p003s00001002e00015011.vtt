00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.740
So what skills? What I like to have mastered before my profession. Um

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.630
 um Naval Academy. And so I learned a lot, and we had four years of practice,

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.510
 and we have summer cruises at the Naval Academy. That was very

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.400
 important to help me, uh, get along. I know that some while our

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.290
 fellow officers, um, they wish they had dunmore scuba to prepare for

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:36.180
 being a seal for to prepare them to be buds. Um, 80 years, there was

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.060
 some time at the academy that would've been available to me to go

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.950
 the flying club and a couple private pilot's license. No, I didn't do

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.840
 that for some of the shit driver recommend something like that. There

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.730
 are flying skills, if you could understand flying an aircraft, and

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.610
 that would be important also, because in this this day of drones,

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.500
 Okay, we're gonna be using drones in every aspect of naval warfare.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.390
 So if you can learn to pilot a drone and have that type of experience

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.280
 under your belt and I know you'll be able to apply that and we didn't

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.160
 have I do not have that time that experience a technology available

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.050
 to me when I was growing up and just starting in my profession
