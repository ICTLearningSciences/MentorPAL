00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.890
has different All, Sir, you're going to have new team members reporting

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.940
 aboard this ship, this water to the organization. So things that you

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.980
 want to look at is where does the person on the team fit? Okay, What?

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.020
 Unless is, does this person where in the Manning document does

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:31.070
 he or she fit? If I need a SAR swimmer and the sewer swimming school

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.110
 is only offered, you know, semi annually. And I report that three saw

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.150
 swimmers aboard the ship. Okay? And this person is reported to me

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:49.190
 as a star swimmer, but hasn't been to this girl. Okay, Now I have to

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.240
 make sure that he or she has had time and reported in route to coming

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.280
 to my Does he have time? She had time to get this article. By the

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.320
 way, when you get those orders and you're looking at your team, rotations

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.370
 starts when the school is very important for the chef way. Need

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:19.410
 somebody out there? That's your responsibility. It's not the person.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:25.450
 It's your responsibility to make sure that you have a full complement

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.500
 of people need to carry out a mission. So you know, it's our

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.540
 swimmer is leaving. Make sure you've either identified a new person

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.580
 coming of war to go and be this over, for you have identified someone

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.620
 else with a team to go to saw school become. The ships are small now

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.670
 I've since our swimmer, but that applies for a majority of multiple

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.710
 off unless is within the ship.
