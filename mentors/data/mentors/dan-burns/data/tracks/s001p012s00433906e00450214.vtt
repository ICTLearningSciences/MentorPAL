00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:08.400
alcohol while deployed well, we are drying British Navy's a wet baby.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.960
 They have wow our crew from rations. Continue rum rations. They continue

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:23.510
 like a drink, but you cannot drink 12 hours party. Take a watch.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:31.060
 If you are deployed 72 days out of court, then the beer ration is

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:38.610
 two beers per day per sailor. Once it's in two days, that check raise

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:46.170
 for the fleet that you're in to ensure, according the right day. And

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.720
 then it's two beers per day per person. And then when you pull in,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:01.270
 the clock starts over again. Certainly you can drink when you're out

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:08.820
 walking country. If you go over to Naples, you pulled it in. You

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.380
 certainly can be careful, but, uh, you can certainly trade while out

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.930
 roving in its form. Sean.
