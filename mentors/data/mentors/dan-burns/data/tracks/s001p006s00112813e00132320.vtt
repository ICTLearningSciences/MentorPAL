00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.910
It's a good resource is to look at while starting out. Remember, the chief

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.960
 of Naval operations? CNO has his recommended reading list. Secretary

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.020
 of Defense. I have not seen his reading list lately because the

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.080
 Secretary of Defense is acting at this point, but he will come out

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.130
 with his reading list. And most of the admirals and generals Common

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.190
 war. You know, we'll have a reading list. Okay, I read that. Okay.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.240
 Uh, General Patton War to General Patton. What he wanted to West Point

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:49.300
 Had he survived a war to be sent back there. Leave West Point General

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.360
 one everyone to study history, history. History was not interested

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.410
 in engineering. And that's that's very fascinating to hear from

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.470
 General Patton, because he is the one that learned on his own how to

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.530
 move a tank. And that was a technological innovation from one World

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.580
 War Two. Let's create And everything else was built around the tech.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.640
 He learnt the tank, and yet he professes history. Read your history,

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.690
 learn the art of warfare because with every new technological innovation,

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.750
 you still have to have men and women behind that innovation

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.810
 to implement a strategy to implement the art of warfare that has a

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.860
 change. So study warfare, study your tactics, study your procedures.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.920
 Weren't those
