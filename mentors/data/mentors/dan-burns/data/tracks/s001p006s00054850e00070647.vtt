00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.420
what was the most difficult part of my training. So I as a chief engineer,

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.990
 I chose the engineering halfway for my career. And one of things

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.560
 about that is it's very much hands on. You have to learn the hands

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.130
 on. You have to see. I had to see it way had to do a lot of cutaways

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.700
 off the gas turbine engines to see what the airflow waas is and how

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.270
 you could generate the power to the gas turbine and how it goes from

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.840
 the gas turbine engine room all the way through the whole year, all

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.400
 way out to the propeller that moves the ship that you go from standing

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.970
 still 2 32 knots at flank speed 32 knots in about 40 miles an

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.540
 hour. You could do that in under a minute. With a gas turbine ship.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.110
 You've got to keep all that information in your head and how to do that.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.680
 The same thing could be applied through cyber attacks for the operations

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.250
 officer for a cryptologist. How do you maintain you've got

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.820
 to go ahead and see all that
