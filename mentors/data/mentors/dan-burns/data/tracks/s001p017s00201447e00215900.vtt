00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.380
overseas screening is quite extensive. Only for you, for the family also.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:13.920
 And go on. Awesome. That oversees reading. If there is a problem

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.450
 with a family member, for instance, if a family member is exceptional

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:26.980
 registered in the acceptable family program, then the Navy made making

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.520
 a choice to switch you out. And, uh, that way you could stay with

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:40.050
 your family and swap out with crew that's going across. That is

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.580
 one thing that the Navy has tried to do with ships deployed. Um, overseas

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:53.110
 is is have the crew swats. Okay, Well, Excel was an excellent

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:59.650
 XO. Yeah. So my ex know from my experience, I'm sorry for my spirits.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:06.180
 He was from Japan. He was he was chief of the air is gonna be so off.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.710
 Thus, the ship that we were replacing so rather than him do that

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:19.250
 and moved his family to San Diego, he was swapped out and he came to

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.780
 the U. S s five game. That's old fight. So the Navy does swap out

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:32.310
 little one and the Navy will work with you. It has a lot of screaming

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.850
 for available to help you get your stuff ready. Put your stuff in

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.380
 storage and movie
