00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:08.570
How do you enforce the honor? Okay. Well, to assume that everyone's vicious

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:16.290
 species, the other one's got the data was really not a girl has

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:24.010
 gone down. Uh, so but on the west, how do you ensure that your you

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:31.730
 know, it's operable in completing their mission? Oh, that's simple.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:39.460
 Expect or you personally inspects. So if the next watch they were supposed

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:47.180
 to bring on, you know, bring number two boiler at a lay up and

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:54.900
 getting ready to go online on the old 400 watch and you come up.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:02.620
 I had four hundreds. Take the watch, and the book was not out. Uh, what's

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:10.340
 going on? Okay, so it's things like that. You know, if all of

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:18.060
 a sudden you know things are not happening way posted, that's an indication.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:25.780
 So you have to turn around and enforce it. Okay, um, we were

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:33.500
 supposed to have allied ships, boats stowed away, and then everyone

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:41.230
 could go on the recall ships boats on stowed away. I'm not taking

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:48.950
 the watch. You could keep the watch. Do you still live? So that's an

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:56.670
 indicator. It's hard. It's not like the batteries. The fleet is not

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:04.390
 the academy. So what? We can still expect that you would bring duty,

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:12.110
 honor, country, honor and Fidelity Integrity's with you.
