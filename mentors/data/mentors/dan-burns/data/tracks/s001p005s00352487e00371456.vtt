00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.940
So what I do in my career that was different for my earlier thoughts or

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:13.040
 time thinking about going into the Navy. Hello. I personally made

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:19.130
 up my mind to go into the Navy in the third grade on. You know, at that

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.230
 point, you have a lot of romanticism. You see all the movies of

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.320
 China at that time to John Wayne movies, and they follow the eccentric

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.420
 center, and it looks rather noble. It is a noble service. It is a

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.510
 noble calling. It is great job to go and do. But the day to day of

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.610
 running a ship being with the division, Um, that is, shall we say, less

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.700
 romantic. The actual day today, in and out, Um, the years seem to

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:01.790
 There's no saying for mother about years are short, but the days are

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.890
 long and so a day at sea is very long. But when you look back, they

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.980
 flash by in an instant and you recall your seats. I will say, you

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:20.080
 know one thing, you'll make a lot of good friendships along the way

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.170
 along your tour. Along your career, you'll always have one or two people

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.270
 that you will swear by for life that you'll still know. I know

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.360
 men and women from all my ships and the line. See tours, then short

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.460
 doors. Remember, you'll develop very, very fond friendships will carry

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.550
 you for your lifetime.
