00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.450

 gotta read, you've got a devour. You've got to understand it because

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.050

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.850
 and embark on the Reagan. Um, so a lot of that is going to be so a lot.

 That is classified. Yes. Any ship movement is frankly, classified.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.640
 Information goes back to World War two adage. Loose lips sink ships,

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.040

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.440
 Um, and then you have to remember to keep it classified and remember

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.840
 who you're talking to. Remember that there are parts of the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.240
 ship that are skiff secret compartmented information facility. Okay.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.640
 Combat and very much so. You know, the engineers are not cleared for

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.040
 classified information. It's outsiders all clear for information.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.440
 You, as a leader, have to make sure you remember who you're talking

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.840
 to.
