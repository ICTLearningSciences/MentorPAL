00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.510
So, as a division officer, you're going to be out at sea on your ship.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:12.180
 And this would apply also two aviators when they do with disassociated

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.840
 see tours or the submariners when they come topside, when they're

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.500
 trying to qualify for there. Uh, Carrie cvb g the carrier battle groups

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.170
 tours. You have to do a tour of the ship, one of things about

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.830
 life, and see when the carrier goes out your signs to carrier battle

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:40.490
 group, you Miss Navy Prize itself on under waiver punishments on one

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:46.160
 of the things you have to develop is your seaman's eye to make sure

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.820
 that you could bring your ship alongside. I did the carrier or the

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.480
 replenishment ship. And that's the one thing that ship drivers surface

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.150
 warfare officers pride themselves on is learning how to drive that

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.810
 ship and keep that ship alongside that punishment because you don't

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.480
 want to crash into or play bumper cars. That is not good at all.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.140
 So or just, uh, underwear your punishment I had I was in the Bering

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.800
 Sea's that's north of Alaska. First ship. We took it. We went up the

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.470
 West Coast. What through the Bering Sea's into the illusions, and we

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.130
 did it underway replenishment for eight hours. And I had the con for

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.790
 about six of those eight hours that's developing your seaman's. I.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.460
 That's the kind of thing that you it is very hard to do. But once

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.120
 completed, once you have that a everyone knows you're the you're the

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.780
 guy. You're the gal that could drive that shift. Well, the guy you're

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.450
 the gal, go out and keep the ship out of harm's away. That's very

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.110
 sensible.
