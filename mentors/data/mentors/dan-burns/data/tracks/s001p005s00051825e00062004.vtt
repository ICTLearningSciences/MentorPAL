00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.470
This is the physical environment in which I worked, varied and see the

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.080
 enable ship shook our environment. Aria in the engineering spaces was

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.700
 was on the eventual ships. Very hot way. Had stress programs, horse.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.320
 But is there any spaces? Were man 25 hours a day, of course. Topside.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.940
 Spaces of bridge war. The combat mission set in the heart of the

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.550
 ship. They were at condition spaces, in fact, avarice. What? Don't

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.170
 worry. You know you wear sweaters inside the ship. Just stay warm

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.790
 because you have to keep yours. Oh, um, physically, the ship's a ship's

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.410
 environment under way, is very demanding. You have to be in shape.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.020
 Physically fit. Well, that's one of the reasons we have. Ah, his

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.640
 memories.
