00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.510
so far in which I work five it was chief engineer on board your system

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:14.180
 hello which was the first ages reserves to and through the week walk

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:20.840
 one ages all one or what once a world walked twelve so it was pretty

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:27.500
 high exact at the time order actually I must admit that the your

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:34.170
 system is a right now she is on the wall she has got the baby Jones

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.830
 and the technology that she was had hi tech at the time that come with

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:47.490
 that problem so what can you do to be better added is is read up

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:54.160
 on it the available through the it's only going to not be afraid of

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:00.820
 the technology co abrasive as you can because when you lose a lot of

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:07.480
 change well they just change that only really walls it because they're

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:14.150
 comfortable with what they just more and now you're using on you

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.810
 baseline twelve point one of the more I think I just are twelve this

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.470
 for the one I just got comfortable with my iPhone not a good I was

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:34.140
 ten where is it says access now is a live the model the eight plus

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.800
 yeah so these are going to come and they are going to change and you're

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.460
 the best thing to do is is have an open line to try fiddle with

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.130
 it and go play with it try to break it right right did you just try

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.790
 to understand how it works hello they have an open like that
