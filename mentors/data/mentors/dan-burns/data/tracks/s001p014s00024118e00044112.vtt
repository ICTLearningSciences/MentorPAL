00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.910
so technological environment, which I worked. Uh, it was chief engineer

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:14.960
 on the war years, which waas the first ages cruiser to the fleet.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:22.020
 Lot one ages one point what we'll say we're on lock 12. So it was pretty

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.070
 high at the time over. Actually, I must admit that your system

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.130
 on the road is all right now she is underwater. You got the Davy Jones

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:43.180
 and technology that she was had while high tech at the time it kept

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:50.240
 coming. So what can you do to be better at it is read up on it, be

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:57.290
 available to be attended joint. Do not be afraid of the calls we go.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:04.350
 Embrace it. Yes, you can. Because when people say they love change,

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.400
 no change is change. Yeah, Nobody really loves it because they're

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.460
 comfortable with what they just learned. How you're introducing a new

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:25.510
 baseline. 12.1, just 12. This Lord 11. I just got comfortable with

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:32.570
 my iPhone nine. I was 10 X. Now there's a left. What was the matter

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:39.620
 with a plus? So the technologies are gonna come and they are gonna

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:46.680
 change your essay. Do is have an open line to try it fiddle with it.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.730
 Don't play with it. Try to break it. Trying to break it. You're just

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:00.790
 trying to understand how it works. You have a nobody like that.
