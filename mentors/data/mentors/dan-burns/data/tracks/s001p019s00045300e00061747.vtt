00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.890
you as a naval officer. Paperwork go faster. Well, if you figure that

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.930
 out, I would like to, Um a lot of the forms are pre filled these days.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:21.970
 That's nice. As opposed to To fill them out from scratch. I put them

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:29.010
 in and computer punch cards. And yes, I have done that incident

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.050
 because of traffic. Would come in on that ticker tapes way. Don't use

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:43.090
 tape anymore, but I can't see that The DT DT is that Wait Â£80. They

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:50.120
 are now the size of a two terabyte hard drive. Okay, that the weight

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:57.160
 pounds. So how could you make things go faster? Probably keeping

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:04.200
 files. Okay. Keeping fit reps. Keeping the forms filled out for eight

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:11.240
 reports that you have to fill out your pulse assistant film out for

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:18.280
 the chief engineer says so. I have files filled out that are readily

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:25.320
 available to you That would help you work easier
