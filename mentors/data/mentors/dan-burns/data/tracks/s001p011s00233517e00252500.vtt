00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.630
have you helped for a while. This is a lot of my career. I'm sure we'll

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:12.410
 do it your time. So the first thing about morale is to get the word

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.190
 out, get the proper word out because there is going to be a ruminant.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:23.970
 We're not going. All know, we've been extended another 30 days now.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.750
 We've been extended of 60 days. Hey, did you hear? We're going Thio,

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.530
 Australia. They won't think you as divisional search team is hit

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.310
 the right word out on people who always try that rundown rumors. That's

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:47.090
 one thing about the day. There will never be a shortage off scuttle

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.870
 butt and rumors out there. So one away you help around is by doing

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.660
 that is is getting the word out? No, we're not going to Australia.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.440
 Yes, we have been extended, but we've only been extended by two

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.220
 days. Not that you could get that word. Get out what you can. And then

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.000
 you become known as the person that's got the scoop. It's got gabs.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.780
 That's got the right, um, other things. Helping, uh, you know, hot

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.560
 walks, you know, football games or help the group Go do something.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.340
 Yeah, they will get to go to this is gonna be all kinds of things.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.120
 Getting award out is the most, of course, because people just wanted

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.900
 to try to plan their lives a little bit. Have all shit a lot. You can't

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.680
 help that.
