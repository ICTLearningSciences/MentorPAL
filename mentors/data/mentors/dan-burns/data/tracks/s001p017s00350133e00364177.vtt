00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.130
owning and renting a house. Um, I can tell you, it's It's if you have

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:13.410
 the wherewithal to Oh, the house. That's great. What are you gonna be

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.680
 moving? You can't count on home. Steady. You? Even though the Navy

 Off your house. So that means you have to read it. If you're comfortable

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:38.520
 with, then, Yeah, that. You know, I was told as a ship driver,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.790
 sooner or later I would always go back to Awful, uh, Newport, Rhode

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:51.070
 Island. Why, Newport? Well, farm had division, officer, department,

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.350
 ex CEO school is there. And the war colleges there. So you could

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.630
 do a lot of tours in Newport, so makes sense to buy it. You know, um,

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.900
 it can be done if you want. I want watch your personal finances on

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.180
 that one. Although right now I'm sitting here making this, You know,

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.460
 there's a 30 year low in the mortgage rates, so that's phenomenal.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.740
 Is that gonna last? You never know. So what if you can? Yeah, advisor.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.010
 I would advise doing it because you have a house to sell off late.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:41.290
 You could always sell it. But you also have a house to live in
