00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.070
Okay, So what kind of sailors supposed problems? Just, you know, if if

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:13.290
 there was a magic, you know, class glasses that you put on C b great.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.510
 Made a lot of money, saw that one there isn't necessarily so can

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.730
 identify, or you're gonna find him. One of things about that is you

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.950
 wanna be careful with your time This time is the one thing that we have

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:38.170
 very little off. If you wind up, try to spend 90% of your time on

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.390
 10% of your problem Children. Okay, What about the other 90% that

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.620
 are good? So this is the balance that you're wrong. I have to come up

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.840
 with as a leader. Treat Everyone fairly goes about saying, treat them

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.060
 fair. But if the troublemakers are out there, just how much say

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:09.280
 ignore them. But be careful about the rest of the unit arrested with

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.500
 division. Because if you wind up spending 90% every time for the one

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.720
 percenters, you're going to lose the rest of the nation. So that's

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.940
 hardly work at balance. But it will pay off
