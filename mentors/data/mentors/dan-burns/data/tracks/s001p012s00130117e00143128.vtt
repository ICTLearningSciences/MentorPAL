00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.860
So with regards to what's called the silver Bullet wars, Um, I myself

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:12.860
 had a silver bullet tour. I took a ship from my second ship from San

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.870
 Diego to you. Just get your pad and then walked up living for much

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.880
 of two years. So as a result of that, I got a silver bullet. I was allowed

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.890
 to go. That's what my soul bore on time. So regarding that it

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.890
 was hard shipped off. Anyone with a family doing that, So But you gotta

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.900
 think it through, you know? So for two years of pain of living

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.910
 onboard a ship that goes to Japan, you know what I get? Well, I got

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.920
 to go. Hey, Capital for? Yeah, I met my wife there. That's a lot of

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.920
 four. That was warning the ed. That was more of it on the ship while

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.930
 I was out there, I got to see all hope was to Pacific. Had to see every

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.940
 port there was. I crossed the line twice, Three times, uh, four

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.950
 guys came back out four times. Cross the line for five hours and I

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.950
 have to see every port there. Waas, soas, faras, John Paul Jones and

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.960
