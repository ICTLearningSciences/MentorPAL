00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.290
with regards to what's called the silver bullet wars I was so that is

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.720
 so overboard for that's okay sure from one second ship from San Diego

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:20.160
 to the level of living in the future and for sure was it two years

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.600
 so as a result of that goes overboard I was allowed to go muscle on

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:33.030
 so regarding that it was was a hardship for yeah they want anyone with

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.470
 a family doing that so but you got to think it through you know

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.910
 so for two years of pain of living on board the ship speeches and you

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:52.340
 know what I yeah well I got to go travel for and I met my wife there

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.780
 that's a lot of what I was worried that the ad that was worth it

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:05.210
 on the ship while I was out there I got to see also says that as a C.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.650
 every port there was I cross the lines what as you get back up four

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:18.090
 times one fourth of at the C. every quarter there once so as far as

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.520
