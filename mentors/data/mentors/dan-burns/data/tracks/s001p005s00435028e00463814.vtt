00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.640
I moved 17 times in my baby seventies. It's a lot of ghosts. Frankly,

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.430
 before I was married, I I didn't have a care I would move anywhere to

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:18.210
 do to get the job. I wanted to be in California, all the shift those

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.000
 born and raised in Brooklyn. So I took the first ship I could find

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.790
 out of the West Coast. After that, the detailers would call me and

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:35.580
 say, You've done a bang up job and now we've got a tour for you on the

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.370
 USS Fife and the life was coming out of the yards in San Diego and

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.150
 going to your piece. Get your pants. So that was the change of whole

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.940
 port, which you may or may not experience again. Your your time.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.730
 So the other. In my time, there was a lot of moving around. The idea

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.520
 of home standing and staying in one port really wasn't a tool that

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:10.310
 was available now. They tried to keep personnel in the whole court to

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.090
 minimize the amount of moves, but frankly, it can be done. It has

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.880
 done a lot for personnel that are assigned to you. Goose get to Seventh

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.670
 Fleet to fifth fleet once they move you out there, they like to

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.460
 keep you there so they'll move your back to Goto far ahead. Schools

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.240
 go to XO school. Good to see old school, but they'll send you right

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.030
 back to you. Kuska, um and or fifth fleet war out to six. Fleet in the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.820
 med. So nice thing about that, uh, Homestake pieces. It's easier

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.610
 on the family staying hold. If you happen to be married, you're not

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.400
 married. You know pretty much you're gonna pack your seat back. You're

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.180
 kidding. Double where you where you want to go. And that's if you're

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.970
 if you're not married. But if you are married, this goes back to

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.760
 John. Paul Jones joins Navy in the world. If you're willing to travel,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.550
 they will send. You don't want to travel. You can figure out a way

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.340
 to stay in the whole board. It's it's more walking around and finding

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.120
 a job before the detailers will work with you to keep you there

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.910
 if so desired. Personally, I I as I said, I moved 17 times like her

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.700
 a lot, so I I didn't have a problem
