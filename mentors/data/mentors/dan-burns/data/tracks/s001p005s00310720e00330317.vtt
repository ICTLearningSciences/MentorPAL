00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.650
don't. Okay, So what gets romanticized about being in the Navy That that

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:12.450
 really isn't that great? So I'd have to say in my own in my own case,

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.250
 um, you know, trying to balance the good at the demands of being

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:24.040
 at sea with a family. And I had personally, you know, my daughter

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.840
 was born and I went away for the 1st 10 months of her life. And then

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.640
 I came back and I finished my seat, or I went to my short tour, and

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.440
 I qualified as an exile for ages cruisers, command of a small boy.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.240
 My son was born and they wanted to send me back to have to see for another

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:53.040
 four years. So the radishes, um there at kind of a one off. At

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.840
 that point, I had done everything I wanted to do. I qualified for

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.630
 command. See, I had been there on the job. I've seen the world that

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:10.430
 I've been in every ocean on the planet, so I was not ready. I have the

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.230
 cheers between you know, my family and being my love, the Navy on

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:22.030
 I married my wife, so I decided to stay with the family. But I will

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.830
 say I did go into the reserves. I was able to finish out by 12 years

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.630
 in the reserves and have a 30 year career. So it gets hard. That's

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.420
 a decision that everyone has to make individually. Um, and there's

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.220
 no way around it. It's just a decision that you have to make when those

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.020
 trolls are born and you will have Children. Presumably, you know,

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.820
 in a 30 year career you may get married and have Children.
