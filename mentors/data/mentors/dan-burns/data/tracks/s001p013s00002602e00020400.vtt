00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.850
so complete my training for OD on the way it's going to vary because you

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:14.850
 have to be on your way and it depends where you hit the ship and

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:21.850
 its shore and see cycle patient. So if you report to a ship in the shipyard,

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:28.840
 that's a while. You report to the ship while she's on deployment.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.840
 That's great. Personally, I met my ship on the deployment. I

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.840
 was able to qualify for Yau in 81 days. And then there was just not

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.840
 enough time to go topside and qualified. So then we went to the shore

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.840
 rotation and we were in port for a year before we deployed again.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.840
 And then I qualified for my also south. I'm assuming this is also that

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.840
 underway. Also, that underway requires a year A good, solid year

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.830
 off underway time doing all the evolutions. Okay, that means, you know,

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.830
 anchoring. That means unwraps, refuelings, etcetera, etcetera, More

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.830
 bored, etcetera. Personal transfers so could take a year. Qualifies

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:38.830
 also that import two weeks, two weeks
