alcohol while deployed. Well, we are drying Bruce Davies a wet. Maybe

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.960
 they have wow, our crew from Russians. Continue rum rations. They continue

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:23.510
 like a drink, but you cannot drink 12 hours party. Take a watch.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:31.060
 If you are deployed 72 days out of court, then the beer ration is

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:38.610
 two beers per day per sailor. Once it's a few days to check the records

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:46.170
 for the fleet that you're in to ensure according the right day,

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.720
 and that it's two beers per day per person. And then when you pull

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:01.270
 in, the clock starts over again. Certainly you can drink when you're

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:08.820
 out walking country. If you go over to Naples, you pulled it in. You

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.380
 certainly can be careful, but, uh, you can certainly trade while

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.930
 out robing in its form and showing the flag.
