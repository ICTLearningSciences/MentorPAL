So take your work. It does happen. You know, uh, it's they say that the

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.140
 navy runs on coffee. Yes, all are smaller. That war to looking over

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:20.790
 nineties on. Personally, I was always a great judge of bad coffee

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:27.430
 because we didn't have a Starbucks on four of my ship, actually off

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:34.080
 all my shift's weeding out Starbucks, you could maybe go to a stop. But

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:40.720
 we have Starbucks that stuff on fancy electrolytes and all that good

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:47.370
 stuff. So we'll handle fatigue. It goes back to the old phrase of

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.010
 our wooden ships. You have to be in shape. You after your coffee,

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:00.660
 you have to punch yourself whatever it takes, advising anyone to beat

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.300
 to crap out of themselves and slot before all You know what? You're

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.950
 trying to stay off. Wait. Especially if you're on the bridge and you've

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.590
 got a watch to stay away to get up to get the next watch. Well,

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:27.240
 believe it because you have 300 souls depending upon you and your

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.880
 judgment. And if you were on the ship aground to the ship because you're

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.530
 tired, loads is no excuse at all. So drop it. Give me another 20

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.170
 on I stay away The best you can. Let's go. You know your body past,

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.820
 don't you
