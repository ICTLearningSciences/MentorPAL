It's awesome. Common misconceptions about my field. I'll tell you. Very

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.940
 funny. Misconception. Um, when I was on my first ship as a lieutenant,

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.490
 we had a congressional delegation code. Come aboard the ship and

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.040
 the code out use civilians. Staffers that worked for Congressman were

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.580
 six congressmen and approximately 15 staffers. And two of the staffers

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.130
 thought that as naval officers and sailors, we didn't pay any

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.670
 taxes. Hey, that's it. Excuse me? Um, no, uh, car's been in fact, let

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.220
 me show you. And I got the disbursing officer, brought him into the

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.770
 conversation, brought out what's called a leave and earnings statement

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.310
 in L E s and showed it. Looks to me like New York state tax in

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.860
 the federal tax income tax that I have to pay. So that was that was

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.410
 rather interesting. Um, yes, we pay taxes well as the next citizen

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.950
 in our country. So that was That was a funny anecdote that always struck

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.500
 me for some reason that that they think the military doesn't pay

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.040
 things way. Do we try toe have a life just like our citizens that

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.590
