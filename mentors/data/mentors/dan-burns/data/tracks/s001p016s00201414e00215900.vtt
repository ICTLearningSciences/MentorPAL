overseas screening is quite extensive only for you, for the family also,

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:13.960
 and awesome that overseas screening. If there is a problem with a

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:20.510
 family member, for instance, if a family member is exceptional registered

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:27.060
 in the circle family program, then the Navy made making a choice

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.620
 to switch you out. And, uh, that way you could stay with your family

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.170
 and swap out with crew that's going across. That is one thing that

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.730
 the Navy has tried to do with ships deployed overseas is just have

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:53.280
 the crew swats. Okay, Well, Excel was an excellent next, So Yeah.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.940
 the ship that we were replacing So rather than him do that and moved

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:19.490
 his family to San Diego, he was swapped out and he came to the U.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.050
 S S five game. That's old fight. So the Navy does swap out little

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.600
 one and the Navy will work with you. It has a lot of screaming for available

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.160
 to help you get your stuff ready. Put your stuff in storage

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:45.710
