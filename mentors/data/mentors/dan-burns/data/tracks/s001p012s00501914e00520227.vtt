What do you need to worry about? Retirement? Uh, they want, um you know,

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.980
 there is a lot of talk right now about altering the retirement system

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.050
 on going to a high three or going thio competition for a wood que,

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.120
 um, you want to try to invest as much as you can for one case for

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:31.180
 you? We started through that. It'll take care of it back also at the

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:37.250
 back end. You know, you're going is always you go get 20 good years.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.320
 And if that's in the reserves myself, Retired reserve captain Oh,

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.380
 18 years active, 12 in the reserves. So I did not get a good 20 on

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:55.450
 my active side. I had a team, so I needed to MME. Or 12 more years

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.510
 in the reserves and it was able to retire on. Now I get my pay. Um,

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.580
 I planned on that. I planned on my health care. I probably could have

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.650
 done a better job, something away. Money, more money towards a for

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.710
 one day. So whatever you can salt away, you should try. One of the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.780
 rules of thumb was easy enough. When you get your next pay raise every

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.850
 two years you're called up into a higher paying Crockett, the capital

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.910
 raise Put it, Don't touch it. That that was always a good rule

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:43.980
 of thumb.
