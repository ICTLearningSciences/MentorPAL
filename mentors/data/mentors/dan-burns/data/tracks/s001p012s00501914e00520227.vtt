what do you need to worry about retirement they want the you know there

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.980
 is a lot of talk right now about during the retirement system and

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.050
 going to a high three or going to probably issue four oh one K. you

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.120
 want to try to invest as much as you hardware if the four oh one K.'s

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:31.180
 option for you please try to do that we'll take care is the fact that

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:37.250
 also the back in you know you're going is always you go get twenty

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.320
 good years and if that's in there in the reserves you know I myself

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.380
 more are reserve captain eighteen years active twelve hours or so

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:55.450
 I did not get a good twenty on my active side I see so I needed to

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.510
 more of the four more years in the reserves and was able to retire and

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.580
 now I get my teddy I planned on that I've played on my health there

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.650
 I probably could have done a better job also all the way wanted more

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.710
 money towards a four one K. so do you spends all the way you should

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.780
 try to a world where the rules of thumb was easy enough when you

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.850
 get your next pay raise every two years you're all of those are higher

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.910
 pay bracket they have the rays is is is al whose or talk yeah well

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:43.980
 such as that that was always a good rule of thumb
