00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.850
So what? I overcome challenges. Thio leadership is one for you right now.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:14.850
 You're in a smoke free and 80 for the most part underway. And you're

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:21.840
 a drug free navy. Otherwise, until using what I joined the Navy

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.840
 in 1984. Bitch of a neighbor guy, The one that was hot decades. There

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.840
 was rampant drug use from the Vietnam era. Ships could not get underway,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.840
 and that was a problem. So you know that time order zero tolerance

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.840
 for drugs and we started kicking people out and keeping amount

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.830
 way did that. So we had a drug for your name. And now it's very interesting

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:03.830
 that report medical marijuana is allowed in a bunch of states

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:10.830
 at this point. Medical marijuana, though, is not allowed in our

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.830
 navy. So that's gonna be a challenge for you knew. And I'm sure those

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.830
 challenges coming. Okay. But we cannot have officers or enlisted on

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.820
 our ships that are medically, medically on ball. I'd be sand watch,

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.820
 and that does not really saying I need my medical marijuana. Well,

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.820
 you don't need to be a baby that Charlie's home drew off the face
