what things are there for you to do on a ship? Well, remember, ships on

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.960
 called warships for a reason. You are served the country, so one of

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:23.510

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:31.070
 are awesome. What's every ship has some pipe off Jim or some pipe off

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:38.620
 recreational activities. And these days, smartphones. The reason you

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:46.180
 get a degree, that's a lot of fun. Okay, So much. Remember, you know,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:16.400
 off your underwear for the same thing quoted in Port Hole Hanley War

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.950
 from our head or whatever. If you're home and you cause trouble
