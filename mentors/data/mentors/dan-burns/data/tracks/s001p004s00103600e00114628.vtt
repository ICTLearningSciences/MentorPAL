easiest ways to connect with the team members good you are all sure and

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:11.660
 they are listed or see what's the the easiest way is is to stand watch

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.070
 with them you're going to be in a rotation picked out by either

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.470
 your forehead or because you watch all Sir it's got this then that

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.880
 watch ask questions see with this to understand what the personnel are

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.290

 yeah but if you just go to sleep or more watches for for waffle watch

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.720
