00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.760
So it's as part of the listening drills. You'd be issued the plan of the

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:14.660
 dead, and you'll be in quarters you'll read off the planet today.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:21.570
 Somehow, someway, someone you're division will not here and somehow

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.470
 some way fat day, either your department head XO seals will come on

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.380
 by and as that person. So what's going on today? Personally asked.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:42.280
 Is your team member who hasn't? You'd be surprised how often that happens

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:49.190
 or not, and people will complain. I didn't get the word. There's

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:56.090
 only so many ways to get the word out before smartphones before tablets.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:03.000
 Before all that, we had a simple plan it right off everyone,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.900
 what they're doing and what's going on. Um, you know, that's not change,

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.810
 even in the smartphone era. And as we get beyond smartphones,

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:23.710
 beyond, beyond smart from us, someone is still not getting here. So

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:30.620
 what do you do yet? You point out correctly. Did you see the day post

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:37.520
 on? Okay, right behind me today. Right there. What's going on? But

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.430
 if you haven't as division officer taking time to post fell plan on

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.330
 the day, so you need to make sure that it's available to you could

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:58.240
 point to a place that interested. It's in the ship's plan of the day

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:05.140
 file, and here's the U. R L. But if you can't find that, it's your

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:12.050
 responsibility now, if you got it and they continuously don't read it,

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.950
 let's have a talk with two Petty Officer watch and try to come up

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.860
 with a better strategy, but the first thing is make sure you have it

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.760
 posted.
