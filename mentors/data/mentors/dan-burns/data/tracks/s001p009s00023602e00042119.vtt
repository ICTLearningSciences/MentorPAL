00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.420
So what? I overcome challenges Thio leadership. There's one for you right

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:14.000
 now. You're in a smoke free and 80 for the most part underway. And

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.570
 you're a drug free navy other way. I could tell you what I joined

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:27.140
 the Navy in 1984 on a bitch of a neighbor, one that was not got the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.720
 goods. There was a rapid produce from the Vietnam era. Ships could

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:40.290
 not get underway, and that was a problem. So see, you know at that time

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.860
 ordered zero tolerance for drugs and we started kicking people out

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.430
 and kick him out. We did that. So we had a drug for your name. And

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.010
 now it's very interesting that medical marijuana is allowed in a bunch

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.580
 of states at this point. Medical marijuana, though, is not allowed

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.150
 in our navy. So that's gonna be a challenge for you knew. And I'm

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:19.730
 sure those challenges coming. Okay. But we cannot have officers or

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:26.300
 enlisted on our ships that are medically, medically on allied. A walk

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.870
 that was not really saying I need my medical marijuana. Well, you

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:39.450
 don't need to be a baby. That that's the kind of challenges at our

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.020
 home in your face
