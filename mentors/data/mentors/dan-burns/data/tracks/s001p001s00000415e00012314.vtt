00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.490
I am Navy Captain Dan Burns, graduates of the Naval Academy in 1984. I

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:12.130
 am a surface warfare officer Ship driver served on two ships out of

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.780
 the Pacific L P D and screw. It's out of hand. What the U. S Naval

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.420
 discredited school in Monterey and after that, served on my department

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.060
 tours. Chief engineer on a fast forget out of Charleston and on the

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.700
 actual USS Ticonderoga out of normal, deployed on both of those tours

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.340
 with the USS Teddy Roosevelt, Natalie's on both ships and then

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.990
 went ashore to the awesome military affairs at Central Intelligence

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:51.630
 Agency. While there, I screamed for XO of Aegis cruisers and command

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:57.270
 of a small ship. But frankly, at that point my second child had been

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.910
 born and I decided to resign my active duty commission and joined

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.560
 the reserves. I finished out my 30 year career in the reserves. I was

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.200
 recalled once during that time for a total of 18 years of active duty,

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.840
 12 years and reserves, and I retired in July off 2014
