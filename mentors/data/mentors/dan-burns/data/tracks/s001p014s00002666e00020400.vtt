00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.800
so complete my training for OD on the way it's going to vary because you

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:14.760
 have to be on your way and it depends where you hit the ship and

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:21.710
 its shore and see cycle patient. So if you report to a ship in the shipyard,

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.660
 that's you. Awhile you report to the ship while she's on deployment.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:35.610
 That's great. Personally, I met my ship on the deployment.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.570
 I was able to qualify for Yau in 81 days. And then there was just not

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.520
 enough time to go topside and qualified. So then we went to the shore

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.470
 rotation and we were in port for a year before we deployed again.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:03.430
 And then I qualified for my also south. I'm assuming this is also

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:10.380
 that underway. Also, that underway requires a year A good, solid year

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.330
 off underway time doing all of the evolutions. Okay, that means,

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:24.280
 you know, anchoring. That means unwraps, refuelings, etcetera, etcetera,

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:31.240
 award, etcetera, personal transfers. So a year qualifies. Also

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:38.190
 that import two weeks, two weeks
