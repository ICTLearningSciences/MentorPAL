00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.760
my thing right now. Maybe is the exceptional family remember program?

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:12.660
 And if their special needs, then they will keep you in the area that

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.570
 you need to be close to a hospital. Uh, just for instance, one of my

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.480
 shipmates is, uh, five boys, and they all had a congenital defect

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.390
 in stomach lining and had to have special food bags just to eat to stay

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.290
 alive and so he could have deployed. You cannot deploy overseas.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.200
 He needed to be in an area where those food bags were available. So

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.110
 exceptional Family member planning. If you have that that's applicable

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.010
 to your family, then the Navy is gonna go out of this way. Make

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.920
 that happen.
