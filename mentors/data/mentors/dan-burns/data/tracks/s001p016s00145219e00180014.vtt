00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.330
So how early do you get the family involved with the next step? Next career

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:13.810
 stuff. So, frankly, you better have your wife, your significant

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:20.290
 other wife for May files for involved from the get go. Okay, So you're

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:26.770
 married, go north, walk, and then we're gonna choose a ship from

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:33.260
 there and figure out where we're going. So we knew what should like.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.740
 We're going to new reports. We have to go without something, so you'll

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:46.220
 get some house hunting leave and you want to take the family.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:52.700
 That's about the latest. You want to let everybody know you don't want

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:59.180
 to come home and find aides say, Hey, we're moving toe San Diego

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.660
 on Monday, vory 40 men or being a word for that, you might want to use

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:12.140
 that kind of logic, I believe. Ill communications, happy spouse.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.620
 Happy life. So definitely people spouse involved. And the kids. You

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:25.100
 know, kids kids are called military brats for one reason. They follow

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.580
 you around the world. Um, you know, they're gonna wanna know that

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.070
 they're moving. So that's what if you know, you should tell him the

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.550
 way I assumed you. Find out. You should I will say as you get senior

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:51.030
 in right, the shorter time frame that you're gonna find that out Fat

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.510
 Funny story I know is when the A dispersion will be built in the Reagan

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.990
 years. One commanding officer's academy, Graduate pictures, entire

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.470
 war. What Little God also not. I said he was home 54. Well, the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.950
 skipper for Whole 53 had burner. So whole skipper for Whole 54 to go

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.430
 to 53. Who says he doesn't have a sense of humor? The new skipper

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.910
 for 54 walls, of course. Ain't on the academy. Funny the way it was

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:36.390
 hurt when your suit. So the point. That sorry. Is it just, you know,

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.880
 your senior? You're not gonna get that information as time with you.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.360
 You're a junior officer. The exactly Walser our head was ever call

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.840
 for. Well, that's not the case. If you can't see her, you know, you're

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.320
 it was quite a piece of me. You know their lives when this war peg

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:08.800
 in a round hole. It's so
