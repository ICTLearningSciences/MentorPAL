How often will you have to move in your career? So my classmate from Naval

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.690
 Academy, four bucks from Brooklyn. They've created lives, actually,

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:21.610
 a lot of 84th Street. And up until we were department heads, Dave

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:28.530
 had moved twice. I moved 11 times that. Yeah. Now Dave is by several

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:35.450
 deputy for Stratcom. He said the move a couple of times now, war

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:42.370
 since since we've been department heads together, um, the Navy is trying

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:49.300
 to do homesteading, and I'm standing is good for the whole. There's

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:56.220
 no stigma attached to steady if you get it. But first and foremost,

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:03.140
 it's needs off the Navy most of the needs not always gonna be

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:10.060
 in the hole for your means. It may be just that which applies. I wouldn't

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.980
 be where they need you. That's you go with any jet. They kind

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:23.900
 of go yet you know your next duty station afterwards. So you hope about

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:30.820
 details should help you
