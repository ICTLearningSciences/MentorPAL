00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.280
problems did. Would you expect division? Also department head to deal

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.710
 with As an engineering officer, I can tell you that, um, the equipment

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:17.140
 maintenance that's required we had the PMS, the plant maintenance

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.570
 system to make sure that all of the way we had was maintaining that

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.000
 100% of elbow. Well, it's hard to do, is these shifts get over okay,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.430
 and all ships get old. That's that's the point. You have to do a lot

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.860
 of care. Yes, if you you don't want to drive your car from the Pentagon

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.290
 down to Norfolk, that's what's that driving. But if you're gonna

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.720
 drive your car from the Pentagon, San Diego, that's a lot of maintenance.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.150
 That's a lot of fuel. Meth. Take care of that car. You have

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.580
 to take care of your ship. You have to walk around and see phase,

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:06.010
 and you can't take things for granted. Now one of the nice things is

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.440
 they help you. They give you a lot of maintenance manuals. And as the

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.870
 engineering officer, lead damage control officer. You have called

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.300
 damage control plates for the ship so you can look at things you can

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.730
 look at. What is the expected output for the evaporator Sze In my

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.160
 time from or two. In my time we had distillers on boil the water you

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.590
 boil seawater and basically make potable water. Nowadays we have what's

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.020
 called Ouro Reverse osmosis two stars. So we take water from sea

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.450
 water running through the filters toilet. Often we get that. So a

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.880
 decision I have to make every days. Do I have enough, uh, Stillings

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.310
 capability aboard my providing enough water for the crew? Do I have

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.740
 enough water for coffee and drinking? You did, Havel that, um is the

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.170
 U. S. Navy itself on on having that war and not being on what's called

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.600
 war in hours. You don't want to be a water hours. That's not good.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.030
 So the U. S Navy Prize itself chief engineer's pride themselves on

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.460
 having ships that are 100% available, percent maintenance and 100%

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.890
 of drinking water of help
