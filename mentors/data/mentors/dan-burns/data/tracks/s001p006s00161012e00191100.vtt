00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.330
So what is critical to review when you start a new tour on your ship,

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.810
 when you walk up the brow and get you a new ship, one thing that the

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:17.290
 commanding officer always has is this standing orders. And before you're

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.770
 gonna be qualified as an officer, that import or the officer of

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.260
 the deck underway or the tactical action officer you lost the watch,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.740
 you're going tohave to know the commanding officers standing orders.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.220
 This is vitally important because these are his one on one directions

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.700
 to you to tell you. Call me if this happens. Okay? Most easiest

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.180
 thing. One thing is commanding officer to the bridge. Okay, Trust

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.660
 made commanding officer will get to the bridge. Really? When that war

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.140
 goes out over the sea? Because he knows. And he will trust you if

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.620
 you have. If you delay calling the commanding Austin the bridge, that's

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.110
 what happens in the McCain. McCain got in trouble. Manning officer

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.590
 did not get to the bridge. So commanding officers standing orders

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.070
 number one thing that you need to read. In fact, if you're going to

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.550
 a new ship, you might want to ask the exact, you know, can I get a

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.030
 copy off the commanding officer standing orders before you even get

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.510
 there. Okay, that shows that you're being aggressive. You're leaning

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.990
 forward in the saddle and you want to see his standing orders. Now,

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.470
 in addition to that, each night underway are the commanding officer's

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.960
 night orders on the night waters are equally important. It lays down

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.440
 step by step. Okay. When to call the captain for any situation.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.920
 Okay, if there's a contact bearing down on you, what's known as CVD

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.400
 are constant bearing. Decreasing range. You've got some unidentified

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.880
 contact coming down straight at you. Captain wants to know every commanding

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.360
 officer wants to know. When that situation happens. There's

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.840
 a few other situations in there. Hey, we're gonna be refueling tomorrow

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.320
 morning. So on the night watch, we've got a fake out all the hoses

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.810
 on the port side and make sure that we're ready to receive lines

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.290
 and liners, you know, probably at oh, dark 30 in the morning and the

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.770
 standing orders will lay those out. So those two things that you could

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.250
 be from familiarize yourself with that pair you and make you a

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.730
 better officer going to a new command
