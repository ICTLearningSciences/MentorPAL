00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.200
my time is a junior officer. How I lead by example was multiple ways,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.560
 but I sure believe getting out standing watches. We had long underway

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:19.910
 watches 68 hours at a shop, going down and tracing the system's understanding

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.270
 with men. Women are doing on the watch in the engineering

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:32.620
 holes. And I would walk with that a lot of times I would just walk

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:38.970
 Dex. See what the mission Waas. What is the messenger of the watch

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:45.330
 you go call down to a woman should go down to after steering. Don't

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:51.680
 slough it off. What? Someone else? Do it. Pick up the wash law and go

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.030
 stand the watch. Go and stand the death. You see, a lot of times you

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.390
 just go back to your stable and call it a night. Or you could take

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.740
 one more hour down to engineering. Walk with Dex department head.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.100
 No, no. This is, for example, of division officers, but has a department

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.450
 head as chief engineer was able one time walk down. And I have

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.800
 no doubt that you know, one of my head the officers had been working

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.160
 on trying to solve exactly problem for about three hours. He was down

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:42.510
 there a while himself, so I spent another two hours with. So he was

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.870
 there for five hours while I was at two hours, five hours. I fry,

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:55.220
 we finally got it right. Got it figured out we got settles and putting

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.570
 out expected. Sounds strange that it was supposed to deliver. It

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.930
 was a matter of getting the right gaskets and over things in place

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:14.280
 at Matt 0.1 of the master chief's that was on coming watch comes down,

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.640
 finds out you've been here. I just spent two hours in four a gang

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.990
 room, you know, he was not the best tree was like the fact that I had

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:33.340
 done a very much admired if I was very upset that the chief engineer

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.700
 was wandering around the space is high school metal. Love that.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.050
 Men chief engineer took out time. It could've been topside. He had been

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.400
 in the lodge where he could have been elsewhere doing things, but

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.760
 I took time out. I always take a time out to see what your engineers

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.110
 doing See with the boasting nature to take time to walk around management

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.470
 by walking out and be W. That will get you a lot off traction

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.820
 with your division
