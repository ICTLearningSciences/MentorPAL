00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.420
I was a junior officer how I lead by example was multiple ways for possibly

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:13.980
 getting out standing watches we have a wall on the way watches

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.550
 six eight hours at a shot it's going down and tracing the system understanding

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.110
 what the men and women are doing on the watch in the engineer

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:33.680
 holes and I would walk with that lot of five I would just fall

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.240
 thanks see what the mission was what is the messenger of the watch

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:46.810
 you that goal a call to all one should go down to ask you should hear

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:53.380
 dole Swofford off it was someone else a couple wash walls maybe build

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.940
 stand along the instead of the death see a lot of times to just

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.510
 go back to your state or a call the night before you can take one more

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.070
 hour without the the more attacks yeah as department head on over

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.640
 this is so for example of division officers but as the former head

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.200
 as chief engineer I was able once on the walk down live now that you

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.770
 know one of my many officers have been working on trying to solve the

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:39.340
 recall problem for about three hours he was down there all and want

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.900
 to solve this so we spent another two hours with so that meant he

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:52.470
 was there for five hours total while I was at the two hours the fireworks

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:59.030
 are very finally got it right got it figured out all we got that

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.600
 all the cells and pulling out of the expected files before that

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.160
 was supposed to deliver as a matter of getting the the right gaskets

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.730
 no right to voice all AT mad four one of the matter is that was on

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.290
 coming watch comes down points out if you've been in here I just spent

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.860
 two hours in for a day you know you is as she was white the fact

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.430
 that I have done a very much a part of the five I was very upset that

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.990
 the chief engineer with water around the space is a high school for

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:51.560
 two of the middle of that the man in the division a lot of the chief

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:58.120
 engineer took out the log were little better elsewhere but I took

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.690
 time out about see what your engineers to see with the post mates with

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:11.250
 them take time to walk around measured by walking around and be

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.820
 WA that will get you a lot of traction with your division
