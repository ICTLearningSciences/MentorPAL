00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:08.090
first team to meet Sanders. This is one of those times when it's gonna

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:15.320
 depend on the situation. Tell you that one team, but I had to leave,

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:22.560
 was on that ship. Sailed. It's George years, actually. So at that

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.790
 point, the team is gonna have to do it my way. My way is by the book.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:37.030
 My way was to get help in and make sure that we were using the mobile

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:44.260
 training teams eyes, carrot out exercises, any equipment speed made

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:51.500
 sure that we understood technology and carry out drills on. That

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.730
 was a long slog. It was a very long to do that. I can tell you that

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:05.970
 at the end of the day should earn the engineering feat that 12 years,

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:13.200
 I believe the only trophy that was in the days when only one ship

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.440
 this water was a fleet of shit. So that was the situation. If you're

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:27.670
 more than a situation where Dean is right, you have a copy on just

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:34.910
 past Raftery. Everything's great. They built with centered Sam. Just

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:42.140
 stay up on that razor's edge. Stay tight. Stay sharp. Don't slack

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:49.380
 off
