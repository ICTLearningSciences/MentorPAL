00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.960
So what did I do in my career that was different for my earlier thoughts

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.060
 or time thinking about going into hello, I personally made up my

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:19.170
 mind to go into the maybe in the third grade on. You know, at that point,

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.270
 you have a lot of romanticism. You see all the movies of China

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:31.380
 at that time to John Wayne movies and the father sent, and it looks

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.490
 rather noble. It is a noble service. It is a noble calling. It is great

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:43.590
 job to go into, but the day to day of running a ship being with

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.700
 the division, Um, that is, shall we say, less romantic. The actual

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.800
 day today, in and out, Um, the years seem to There's no saying for mothers

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.910
 about years are short, but the days are long and so a day at

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:08.020
 sea is very long. But when you look back, they flash by in an instant

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.120
 and you recall your seats. I will say, you know one thing. You'll

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.230
 make a lot of good friendships along the way along your tour. Along

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:26.340
 your career, you'll always have one or two people that you will swear

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.440
 by for life that you'll still know. I know men and women from all

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.550
 my ships and the line see tours and short doors. Remember, you'll develop

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.650
 very, very fond friendships will carry you for your lifetime.
