How do you get to know your bosses? You're also reporting senior one we're

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.540
 gonna be standing watching with when you're on the way. You're

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:21.390
 going to be in the wardroom sharing meals with Wait, go out, socialize

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.240
 with that. Always social questions. Where the Navy there's always

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:35.080
 gonna be social function. Some points where you can get out of your

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:41.930
 seniors. I would say anymore all it also proves changes. You boy, you'll

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:48.780
 be able to do a bruise shop swap at some point, you volunteer

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.620
 way. Always do that. Especially, were operating with the ally, you know,

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.470
 saying shits exercise. They always looked to send someone you know,

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:09.320
 Gruden also change. Use that, uh, my first ship way. We're operating

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.160
 in LG Focus lines with South Korean Navy on. Somehow it came down

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:23.010
 to the roster and watch lost or won the coin toss in a lot of spending.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:29.850
 Three weeks on the south prison ship. Good. Also exchange to

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.700
 do things. You definitely want to do that And cultivate that your envy

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.550
 work sees a future roll off your ship, your squatters, your division.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:50.390
 You gonna roll something else? So it is always good to ask questions

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:57.240
 we'll have a cup of coffee, so I have a cup of coffee. It's a

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:04.090
 social function, all trained, but I have often asked, That's the one

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:10.930
 way Always ask a senior. So how do you get it? What did you do that

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:17.780
