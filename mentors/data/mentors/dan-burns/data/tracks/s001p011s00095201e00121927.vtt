00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.990
So what encourages accountability? Um, number one sakes. You know, fiduciary

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.120
 responsibility is easy. If you signed for it, you are responsible

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:19.260
 for you become the wardroom mess. Treasurer, you're always possible

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.390
 for the news you become the more the officer responsible for casting

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.530
 all those little tiny boats if you sign for something, okay, fun.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:37.660
 That's gonna be your responsibility. I could tell you when I was,

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.800
 uh do you have a hearing school battered school in Monterey? They

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.940
 were one of the department's. The physics department was running a coffee

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.070
 house out of the mess because there's no coffee at that campus

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.210
 at that time and no one asked permission. I want to know about it.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.340
 Suddenly they were $300 in the hole. How far is attention? So you could

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.480
 weigh have to encourage a little bit more accountability? At that

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.620
 point on, dhe lay down the law in this band that mess okay, because

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.750
 they couldn't come up with, um so it's hardest accountability. That's

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.890
 that is fiduciary responsibility, accountability for the mission

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.020
 for the team. If you're on the A S W officer and we're going out on

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.160
 the range in two months to fire a live warhead. Okay, Thank you. Better

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.290
 know how we're gonna do that. What? All the fire? Because we want

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.430
 to come back with a broom attached to the mast way. Don't wanna be

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:03.570
 known as the ship that couldn't shoot straight because you need to

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.700
 look up fire procedures. You didn't understand how the total ray was

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.840
 supposed to respond to that. You take You met firing criteria because

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.970
 you isolated submarine and you can tell a geo criterias met weapon

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.110
 away. Put it away.
