00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.750
So it's as part of the listening drills. You'd be issued the plan of the

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:14.640
 dead and you'll be in quarters and you'll read off the planet of

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:21.540
 the day somehow, someway, someone in your division Well, not here and

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:28.430
 somehow, some way fat day, either your department head, XO seals will

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:35.330
 come on by and ask that person. So what's going on today and personally

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:42.220
 asked, Is your team member hasn't heard? You'd be surprised

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:49.120
 how often that happens or not. People will complain. I didn't get the

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:56.010
 word is always so many ways to get the word out before smartphones

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.910
 before tablets. Before we had a simple plan. Daddy, read off. Tell

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.800
 everyone what they're doing and what's going on. Um, you know, that's

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:16.700
 not change. Even in the smartphone era. And as we get beyond smartphones

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.600
 beyond beyond, far from us, someone is still not getting here.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.490
 So what do you do? Yeah, you point out correctly. Okay, Right behind.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.390
 May end of the day right there tells you what's going on. But if

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:44.280
 you haven't as division officer taking time to post fell plan on the

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.180
 day you have a problem. So you need to make sure that it's available

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:58.070
 that you could point to a place that interested. It's in with the

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.970
 ship's flight of the day file. And here's the U. R L. But if you can't

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:11.860
 find that responsibility now, if you got it and they continuously

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.760
 don't read it, let's have a talk with two by the office and watch

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.650
 and try to come over the better strategy. But the first thing is make

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:32.550
 sure you have it posted.
