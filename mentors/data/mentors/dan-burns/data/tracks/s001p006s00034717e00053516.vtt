 and then you have to remember to keep it classified and remember who

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.110
 you're talking to. Remember that there are parts of the ship that

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.790
 are skiff secret compartmented information facility. Okay. Combat and

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.470
 very much so. You know, the engineers are not cleared for classified

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.160
