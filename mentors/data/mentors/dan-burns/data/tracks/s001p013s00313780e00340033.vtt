00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.980
What warning signs should you not try to solve Forward? Okay. This date

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:15.100
 age right now are the best team leader. You're the best person in

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:22.230
 charge to be aware off team members of the team members. So when I was

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.360
 a captain, uh, they were postgraduate school. A lot of suicides at

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:36.480
 that point. Maybe wide. It's all the way to be aware off your team.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.610
 Really? Doing a sudden, you know, they're acting strange. One of further

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:50.740
 up the chain of command. If you have a question about anyone's

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:57.860
 mental health, there they are. Okay. Divorces. Sadly, they happen.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:04.990
 Okay, but a divorce, all of a sudden, that effects effects person's

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:12.110
 mental health. That's the same way. So Mom or Dad? Sister brother alone.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:19.240
 A sudden mental health aspect to that. Well, what? The exit department

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:26.370
 had the Excelsior 40 change. No way to get a chaplain over

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:33.490
 asking questions. You do not wanna land on two person team member. You

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:40.620
 land on them. They're not gonna feel secure. It's gonna be even worse,

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:47.750
 you know? So hey, Jones Jones. I'm a cup of coffee with chappelle.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.870
 Don't talk. So it's a law office made coffee. Coffee is probably

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:02.000
 a better way to do it and you'll get personally, I've only had I've

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.130
 had one suicide, my ships, my four ships and I've had three deaths.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:16.250
 Wait. Watch a little person. Um, take care of my cells. Have to be

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:23.380
 aware off people.
