The biggest risk I've taken in my career was to go be chief engineer aboard

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:14.900
 your system. Frankly, few engineers were fired for failing light

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.920
 off exam. Three engineers turned down the job. I was the fourth guy

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.940
 that was picked by my also Waas chief of staff. The fleet, that Apple

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:35.970
 reason and the taipan broke. It needed to be fixed on that wasa

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:42.990
 very gutsy call to go do that. Basically, she she was broken. That

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:50.010
 and she needed a lot of help. And I was able to go there, Chief. There

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.030
 it was. In a year, we passed our light off exam way past our tea

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:04.060
 or coffee off. Badly. Holy book trophy time with only one ship off class

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:11.080
 one Ship his body. Get it? Not that trough. I've got so very satisfied

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:18.100
 with that. That was quite the rest go. I could have said no.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:25.130
 I just want to execute my orders. Maybe needed me to go to talk out
