00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.690
When is breaking the rules? Okay? Course. Popper hands with that is Never

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:14.520
 don't break the rules in that go around. The rules are there to

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:21.360
 protect you. To protect the ship, to fix. Okay, so the best thing about,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:28.200
 you know want to break the rules. We'll break the rules, look at

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:35.030
 them, examined them, study them and figure out the situation that

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.870
 we're far is a waiver. That's your responsibility. That's not the team's

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.710
 responsible. It's real responsibilities. Leader. You know, Skipper,

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.550
 it says we could on Lee take, you know, metric units when we're

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.380
 going to re fuel from the British ships. Do I have metric feelings?

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:09.220
 I don't know. Probably should go get them. How you getting all that?

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:16.060
 You need to read a book so that, you know, when the time comes that

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.890
 you do ask for a waiver. Well, you would have done that in advance

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.730
 past four. It was pretty good about that.
