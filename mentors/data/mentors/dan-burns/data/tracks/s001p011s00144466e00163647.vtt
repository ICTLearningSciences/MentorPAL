00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.440
a SZ faras management of civilian and military personnel yourself, you

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.030
 have to distinguish between the civilian personnel contractors, Resilient

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.620
 said. A lot more invested than the contractors, and the contractors

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:23.210
 are only legally bound to their contract. So there are three

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.800
 players in that in that case, helping you. And the other thing that

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.390
 you need to know. I understand military they're covered with inside.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.980
 The lifelines gets underway. Everyone's underwear. Civilians may or

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.570
 may not be getting underway with depending upon the size ship, because

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.160
 there are so civilians, that big deck aiders and on the carriers.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.760
 But for the most part, civilian contractors, they're not getting under

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.350
 way. Good. They're not on the ship spurt. So do you have to understand

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.940
 what the mission is on? What are they doing? And then situationally?

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.530
 It's different when you engine shipyard, you enter the shipyard,

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.120
 you know? Remember when the bow Ross's sil Oh, the shipyard commanding

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.710
 also don't want responsible? The ship was responsible, of course,

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.300
 but technically, you know the dry dock. Captain Holden's ship

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.890
 that point and the contractors are charge of breaking down kids cutting

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.480
 up the ship. It's stalling new equipment and making that shift better.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:47.070
 So at that point, the contractors become important. Very. During

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.660
 intubated intermediate maintenance of Elba lose the I am a.
