What encourages accountability? Um, number one sakes, You know, fiduciary

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.150
 responsibilities. Easy. If you signed for it, people responsible

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:19.300
 for you become the wardroom mess. Treasurer, you're always possible

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.440
 for the news you become, the more the officer you're responsible for

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.590
 passing all those little tiny boats. Um, if you sign for something,

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.740
 okay, fun. That's gonna be your responsibility. I could tell you when

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:43.890
 I was so er duty, engineering, school, battery school about Ray.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.040
 They were one of the department's. The physics department was running

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.190
 a coffee house out of the mess because there was no coffee at that

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.340
 end of campus at that time. And no one has permission. I want to know

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.490
 about it. Suddenly, they were $300. In the whole, our bar is attention.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.630
 So way had to encourage a little bit more accountability. At

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.780
 that point on, dhe lay down the law and this band that mess okay, because

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.930
 they couldn't come up with it. Um, so it's hardest accountability.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.080
 That's that fiduciary responsibility, accountability for the mission

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:39.230
 for the team. If you're on the A s w officer and we're going

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:45.380
 out on the range in two months to fire a live warhead. Okay. Thank will

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.530
 Better know how we're gonna do that. What? All the fire? Because

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.680
 we want to come back with a broom attached to the mast way. Don't wanna

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.820
 be known as the ship that couldn't shoot straight because you knew

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.970
 I'd get the look out firing procedures or didn't understand how

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.120
 the total ray was supposed to respond to that. You take You met firing

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.270
 criteria because you isolated summer and you can tell a geo foreign

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.420
 criterias met weapon away. Put it away.
