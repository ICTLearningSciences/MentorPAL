00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.790
so, uh, short duty. Uh, you you could travel a lot or a little, depending

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:12.740
 upon the mission that the command that you were at, for instance,

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.680
 what was it? The Naval Postgraduate School was a junior officer. Um,

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.620
 I went out twice. One year following here. I went out three times,

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:30.570
 and that was for four days at most on each of those trips. Um, as

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.510
 your ulcer. Later on, a Szmyd grade officer assigned to the also military

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.450
 affairs of the central tells us agency I was an exercise actually

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.400
 on. I would go to what they called was identified as the initial

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.340
 mid final planning conferences. These plenty conferences would be Monday

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.280
 through Friday. We're on a Friday, you travel days, work days

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.230
 in between. And I ran some 30 exercises in year, so that was quite a

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:12.170
 bit of travel that would be combined in there. Now, we had a lot of

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.120
 also goes back and forth that we were covering each other for, But

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.060
 let's say there was a fair bit of travel, but I was traveling about

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.000
 want maybe two weeks every month I was traveling for the CIA and doing

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.950
 my decisive board back and forth. You could wind up doing that. I

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.890
 know off other officers that traveled as much doing other jobs. And

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.830
 I know of officers that did Maur and other officers that did less.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.780
 What? Again? It depends on the commands mission of I was travel. You're

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.720
 actually wind up. You do it.
