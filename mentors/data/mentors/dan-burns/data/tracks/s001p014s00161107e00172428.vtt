I deal with stress all the job. Personally, I'm a big bag. And on three

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:15.490
 of my four shits, I made sure that I was the person responsible or

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:22.820
 one of my officers or payoffs. Is someone in my team was responsible

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:30.140
 for the ship's Jim shift to be available, So I did. You know, Mike

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:37.460
 right away. Some stress used waits, waits. We just had our in place.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.780
 You have maps and you have really, really friendly. Couldn't choose

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:52.100
 doctors in a steel deck. That car's we would do sit ups and pushups.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:59.430
 A with death economically, probably that good for the body. Stress

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:06.750
 wise. You know, you do 1000 push ups. That's forget the stress out.
