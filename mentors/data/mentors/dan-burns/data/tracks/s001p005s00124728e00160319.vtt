00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.450
So the decisions that I made on a daily basis at CES on my my four different

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.040
 ships, you know, pertains to what was the vision of the ship.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.640
 So, for instance, I had to make sure that as an engineering officer,

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.240
 A ll both engines online, ready to go. And if we didn't have any interfering

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.840
 parts, I had three gas turbines that provided all the electrical

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.430
 power for their ships along the lights. All the power for the

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.030
 computer. Well, it's one of the equipment If one of the generators

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.630
 went down now I'm in a casualty responsible, and my decisions would

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:51.230
 revolve around what it would take to keep that generator. That electrical

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.820
 mood morning. You would think that's an easy decision. But it,

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.420
 Zelig, when you're driving your car, you've got to go from Washington

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.020
 D c down to, uh, no, fool. Do you have another dance in your car?

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.620
 Can you get the car from point A to point B? Same thing with the ship.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:19.210
 You have to know, What is it gonna take to keep that ship running?

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.810
 Well, in this case, you don't have a gas station. So the decisions

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.410
 that I have to make every day are to make sure that I am so sustained.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:36.010
 And I have enough equipment. Resource is personnel. Keep that

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.600
 shit running shipshape. So speak on time. Um, and underway under budget,

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.200
 because again, departments divisions, you all have budgets that

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.800
 you have to maintain. So do we have enough fuel tomorrow? And I'm gonna

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.400
 be taking on fuel from the Shasta. Okay. What is that gonna take?

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.990
 That means I need to make sure that my fueling alignment to receive

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.590
 fuel. That was a personal thing, That responsibility for the chief

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.190
 engineer. I had to personally verify available line so that when we

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.790
 took fuel from another ship keep us under way, doing our mission for

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.380
 the nation. That was my personal responsibility. My job was to make

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.980
 sure that every one of those valves was a line. And I had a dedicated

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.580
 checklist to do that. So there's no one. Where is my checklist

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.180
 decision over to Can I get and see every one of those vowels Inspect.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.770
 Expect what you inspect. So I have to run around and that that it's

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.370
 things like that. Evidently, evolution doesn't sound like much, but

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.970
 when you're the person responsible for taking on fuel to make sure

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.570
 that we don't spill any fuel when we're taking on fuel, that's a very

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:11.160
 you know. That's a very heavy responsibility and requires a lot of

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.760
 fought dedic dedication, and you've got to do it.
