00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.910
It's a good resource is to look at while starting out. Remember, the chief

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.960
 of Naval Operations? See, you know, has his recommended reading

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.020
 list. Secretary of Defense. I have not seen his reading list lately

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.080
 because the Secretary of Defense is acting at this point, but he will

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.130
 come out with his reading list. And most of the admirals and generals

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.190
 Common war. You know, we'll have a reading list. Okay, I read that.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.240
 Okay. Uh, General Patton War to General Patton. What he wanted

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:49.300
 to West Point Had he survived a war to be sent back there. Leave West

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.360
 Point General one everyone to study history, history. History was

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.410
 not interested in engineering. And that's that's very fascinating to

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.470
 hear from General Patton because he is the one that learned on his

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.530
 own how to move a tank. And that was a technological innovation from

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.580
 one World War two. Let's create everything else was built around the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.640
 tech. He learnt the tank and yet he professes history. Read your history,

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.690
 learn the art of warfare because with every new technological

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.750
 innovation, you still have to have men and women behind that innovation.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.810
 To implement a strategy to implement the art of warfare that

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.860
 has a change. So study warfare, study your tactics, study your procedures,

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.920
 learn those
