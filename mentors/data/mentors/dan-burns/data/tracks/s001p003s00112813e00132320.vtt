00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.530
 move its and and and that was it technological innovation from war one

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.580

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.640

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.690
 history learn the art of warfare because with every new technological

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.750
 innovation you still have to have men and women behind that in

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.810
