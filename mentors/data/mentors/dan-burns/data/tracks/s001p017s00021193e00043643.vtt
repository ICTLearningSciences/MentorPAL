00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:08.880
I was being later Change last on effect. Your charge. You're gonna start

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:16.910
 it off. Shit. So, results, it's your responsibility. You think you

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:24.930
 can get away with some leave and literally please, Please, Max. I

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:32.960
 understand, though that ships goes off, life goes on 24 7365 It was

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:40.990
 a without you. Do you have have you put in place love checks and balances?

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:49.020
 Do you trust your number two? Your resentment of all, sir, to

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:57.040
 run the ship and get the ship away if, uh, leader runs is, um bullshit

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:05.070
 into ST Thomas Virgin idols. We dropped the hook swinging on all

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:13.100
 Get Theo on as tenant. I told move the ship. Okay. Our master came

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:21.130
 out move the ship because we were in the swing pattern for the cruise

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:29.160
 ship that was not supposed to. He came in and had not moved. Uh, probably

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:37.180
 sweat. So that's always won on Move your ship. Your washing

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:45.210
 so you could affect your travel. You know, as TV opposition. Go on travel

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:53.240
 safe travel. And I'm also sending in my time. I've seen many officers

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:01.270
 that never left the ship that I was one of three have is that

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:09.290
 I did not enjoy. I have never left his ship. Commander never made

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:17.320
 captain on. And, uh, you know, you're has it from your right or life

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:25.350
 else.
