 War What? Your house. So that you could have written if you're comfortable

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.190
 with, then, Yeah, that. You know, I was told as a ship driver,

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.080
 sooner or later I would always go back to Awful, uh, Newport,

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.970
 Rhode Island. Well, I knew board. Well, Farm had division, officer,

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.860
 department, exit CEO, school is there. And the war colleges there. So

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.750

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.530

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.420
 You know, there's a 30 year low in the mortgage rates, so that's

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.310
 phenomenal. Is that gonna last way? No. No, Never. So if you can Yeah,

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.200
 Advisor, I would advise doing it because you have a house to sell

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.090
 off late, right? You can always sell it, But you also have a house

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.980
 to live in your heart.
