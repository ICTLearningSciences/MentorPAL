WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.160
So if you have in the conflict in the first few days of the unit, is that

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.480
 normal? Maybe remember that there are two different fleets. Land

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.790
 fleet on the Pacific Fleet. So is it normal? Not particularly. But

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:22.100
 could there be differences? Most definitely. There are differences.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.420
 And when you go from one squadron to another swatter, when you go from

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.730
 the training school to the actual deployed water, yeah, there's gonna

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.050
 be a little bit of a difference. And that's where using officer,

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.360
 junior or senior grade officer, you're just gonna get acclimated in

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.670
 that first couple of days and understand. So one of these is that

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.990
 I would most definitely advise. Okay, when you attempted to say, Well,

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:59.300
 we didn't do it on our last ship That way, that's true. But you're

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.610
 not on your life. Shit. You're on. So you've got to adjust to the

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.930
 new ship and that's the thing. I expect the change. Expect there to

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.240
 be differences. You've got the skills to go ahead and perform. So remember,

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.560
 for the most part, all ships go all planes go for we'll go for

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.870
 so you might be tempted. Do you think I didn't do that on my last

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.180
 ship. You know, your last ship, You do shift. And that's the way you're

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.500
 gonna perform on your new ship going forward on the journey, protecting

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.810
 the nation on the mission.
