00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.990
s So how did my work day change over the life of my career? Um, I will

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.140
 say that as a divisional officer at sea at sea duty, um, my day entailed

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:19.280
 a lot of running around and inspecting, making sure equipment

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.430
 worked a lot of spot checks. Um, coming back as a department, The one

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.570
 thing that was that was different was, you know, now people are looking

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.720
 at you. So now all of a sudden is not 25. 30. There's, ah, 150

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.860
 people that are looking to you for the answer. A za chief engineer.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.010
 You know, there is only two times when I had hard casualties, where

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.150
 where the ship waas suffering from a major catastrophic casualty. And

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:02.300
 we were on the verge off what is known as being going cold and dark.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.440
 And so at that point, when the cash Lee was called away and I had

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.590
 to get my transport myself, you know, very fast, very quickly. Down

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.730
 to the central control station CCs. Everyone's looking around, and

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:26.880
 at that point, it knows quite and everyone's looking at you. You're

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.020
 the man. Now that is different from being a divisional. That was the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.160
 one time when all eyes go to you and it's your training, your sense,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:45.310
 your knowledge or experience that you have to rely on is no one else

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.450
 at that boys. So that's the thing about sea duty. A CZ. Always as

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.600
 things are gonna change, things are gonna change between your divisional

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.740
 officer, the former head. But as a department head, you need

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.890
 to use your experience from your division. Also yours. What is it like?

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.030
 How is it gonna play out? Um, and then on on shore duty? I personally,

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.180
 as unsure, did in my first short tour, you know, I was a student,

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.320
 so that wasn't too taxing at the Naval Postgraduate School. I just

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.470
 had to push myself, too. Get my A's, you know, and push on through

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.610
 and learn as much as I could. Um, for instance, because the degree

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.760
 I had was National Security Affairs television Well, not qualify me

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.900
 later on for my second and final active duty short tour. And that

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.050
 was at the hospital to your affairs at Central Intelligence Agency.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.190
 And so I had to rely on my knowledge, gained, uh, from years before

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.340
 at a post graduate school and on my operational experience, learn how

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.480
 to, uh, act, you know how to translate what the fleet is doing and

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.620
 how to use a fleet at the awesome military affairs at the Pentagon

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.770
 with C i A So you're doing doing Maur cerebral work? If you will, Uh,

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:35.910
 when you get to the higher ranks and you're trying to figure out,

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.060
 you know, when you're at it at a combatant command, you know what exactly

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.200
 we want to do with the missile force, What exactly we're going

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.350
 to do with this submarine force? Why are we going to deploy a ballistic

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:00.490
 submarine to the specifics right now? What are the Indians and

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:06.640
 the Pakistanis? Perhaps we don't need a submarine in the Pacific. Perhaps

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.780
 we needed in the Indian Ocean. That's the kind of thing that you

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.930
 do as a senior officer is. Make these recommendations. What is the

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:25.070
 art of the possible? You want to advise the civilians that air advising

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:31.220
 the National Command Authority in C. A. And that's what you're

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:37.360
 telling me? That's what you are being taught to do to be in the right

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.510
 position at the right time, with the right knowledge to advise national

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:49.650
 command authority on what
