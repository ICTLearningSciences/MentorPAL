00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.030
benefits can you take advantage of as a junior officer of the education

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:13.210
 One. Go get your master's degree on the Navy. The Navy pay for that?

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:19.390
 Um, if you want a little, you know, I am a ship driver. I did have

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.570
 an opportunity early on. Was that moderate? I could have changed Group

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.750
 Pass. They were looking for nuclear reactor ulcers. At that point,

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.930
 I did not want to go to a carrier. That was all it was. A lot of

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:44.110
 junior class cruisers were gone that for So I did not want to go with

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:50.290
 your power. I will say, if you are pop world percent e key on your

 fit ruts. You know, you want to think about a switch. You know, you

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.660
 could be a doctor. After 30 years, you can be a dentist. You know

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.840
 you can. Holte is anymore. So that's kind of interesting. You know,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.020
 we're unrestricted line officers. That's mainly I'm talking to this

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.200
 point understood line. But if you after serving some good tours beside,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.380
 you know that's an option, you go to hell to send in tow. It's selected

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.560
 by, you know, the detailers in transition over to medical dental

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.740
 nurse, medical service score. It's a great life. We take advantage

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.920
 of the education
