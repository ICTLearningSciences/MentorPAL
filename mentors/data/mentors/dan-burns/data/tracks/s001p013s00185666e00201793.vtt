00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.650
how you handle people that cannot meet their standards. You know, uh,

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:12.460
 it is a pyramid structure, our baby. If the nice thing about that is,

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.260
 all the standards are laid out so annually at the same time. If the

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.070
 person was told, choose locked out a lot of the peak US requirements

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.870
 for advancing to rate and take the sacrifice exam and fell to do

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:35.680
 that Well, I don't have to recommend you for second class, and they'll

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.480
 be winding about that. But frankly, one thing that you have to watch

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.290
 out for is is if you do have a freeloader out there and freeloaders

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.090
 make a lot of noise. A lot of bravado on the ground toss. Okay,

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.900
 Usually that means someone else is picking up the spot or that person.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.700
 You have to weed that out with your chief petty officer ordered officer

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.510
 and figure out who's really standing watch, and you've got to

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.310
 take care of the people that are living up to their arrows going. You've

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.120
 got to try to take care of those people
