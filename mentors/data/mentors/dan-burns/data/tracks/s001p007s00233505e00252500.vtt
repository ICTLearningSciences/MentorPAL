00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.640
have you help around this song? A lot career. I'm sure we'll do it your

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.420
 time. So the first thing about morale is to get the word out, get

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.210
 the proper word out because there is going to be a ruminant. We're not

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.000
 going. All know, we've been extended another 30 days now. We've been

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.780
 extended of 60 days. Hey, did you hear? We're going Thio, Australia.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:35.570
 They won't think you as divisional officer's team is hit the right

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.360
 word out on. People always tryto run down rumors. That's what. One

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.140
 thing about the day, there will never be a shortage off scuttle butt.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.930
 And we're out there. So one away you help around is by doing that

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.720
 is is getting the word out? No, we're not going to Australia. Yes,

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.510
 we have been extended, but we've only been extended by two days. About

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.290
 10. Okay, that that helps. You could get that word. Get out what

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.080
 you can, and then you're you become know as the person that's got

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.870
 the scoop. It's got the gout. So it's got the right, um, other things

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.650
 helping, uh, you know, hot rocks, you know, football games or help

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.440
 the group go Do something. Yeah. They won't get to get to. This is

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.230
 gonna be all the things that you could help. Getting the ward out is

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:45.010
 the most, of course, because people just want to try to plan their

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.800
 lives will have their lives. You felt that.
