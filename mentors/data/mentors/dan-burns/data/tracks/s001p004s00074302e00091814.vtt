00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.800
so on board naval ships and submarines. Also, the commanding officer is

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.740
 at the top of the organizational command. Below him is an executive

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.690
 officer. Well, the executive officer are multiple department heads.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.630
 One of the department heads is a chief engineer. The chief engineer

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.580
 is responsible for all propulsion heating, liked water, which everything

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:36.520
 that it takes to make a ship or suffering go for because maybe

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.470
 ships we go forward. Navy ships, Navy aircraft, go for we fight forward,

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.410
 not designed to go in reverse, decide to go forward into the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.360
 line of battle. So, as a chief engineer, by responsibility, I had 150

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.300
 men assigned to bay on the USS Ticonderoga had an operational annual

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.250
 operational budget of about 30 million. And all told on the equipment

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.190
 infrastructure, if you will, I'd say that ship was worth that.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:18.130
 I was responsible for about $750 million. So that's what we do. Is chief

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.080
 engineer is keep the ship running in on, uh, locally, we I would

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.030
 say I was the person the guy responsible for getting the ship from

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.970
 point A to point B. That's what I did on board the ship
