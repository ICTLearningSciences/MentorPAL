00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.880
that'll pay for what? There is a system that you are becoming familiar

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.910
 with. DTs defense travels Irv's is on. It's an overrated system. They

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.940
 pay for your tickets. You want you get old, you need to go somewhere

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.970
 you do. You go into DTs, you plan your trip, then the contacts also

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:31.010
 supply officer will get you traveled out. Your number that gets

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:37.040
 applied and they booked travel. And you also have your government travel

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.070
 card because he'll be issued that you haven't already been issued.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.100
 And then they could book the ticket. You execute the travel and

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.130
 then at the end, you come back and you file a travel. He your receipts,

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:01.160
 anything over 25 bucks. Although I'm told it has changed. I kept

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.190
 everything every received over $25. Now you just file it, Fill that

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:13.230
 out. We used to have travelled clerks that fill all this out for you.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:19.260
 I think the case anymore, you have to become your own expert travel,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.290
 filling out those things Probably the hardest part. Travel. Oh,

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.320
 child, make sure that you get all your expenses that one struggles job
