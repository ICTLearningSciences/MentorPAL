 so that we have the right if you're comfortable with the brand then

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.400
 yeah that you know I was told as a ship driver so I would always go

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.660
 back to the awful the Newport Rhode Island all I knew for one whole

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.920
 format division all through the park XO seals who was there and I will

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.170
 call so you can do a lot of towards in Newport so it makes sense

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.430
 to buy it and read it by the you know it can be done if you want to

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.690
 watch your personal finances on that one although right now though I'm

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.950
 sitting here making this you know there's a thirty year low in in

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.210
 the mortgage rates so I was phenomenal is that gonna last hello you

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.460
 never know that so if you can yeah I've always would be I would advise

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.720
 doing it because if you have a house to sell off later on sellers

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.980
 which also have a house to live in when you fathers are
