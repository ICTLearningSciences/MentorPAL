So what worries as a junior? Also, our special worries as you, you know,

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:15.770
 like you. You know, the first day going with your ship, you're gonna

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:23.220
 You're gonna select the ship to go to duty station on the first

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.680
 day sign. And what am I doing here? Why was I the guy picked to go?

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:38.140
 We all smell their affairs. Social politics. Well, one maybe picked

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:45.600
 you, but as a baby decided, you are the right person to go into that

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:53.060
 job. So we think you got the chutzpah to pull it off. One Don't talk

00:00:53.060 --> 00:01:00.510
 yourself. Go do your job. And And one brother, we'll step in a phone

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.970
 slowly. Is that far your farm? I was for a while that generals general

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:15.430
 heighten strike up. You want everyone to be fire marshals by firemen?

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:22.890
 Okay, well, it's kinda hard to be a far marshal. When father

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.350
 happens, it happens. You wantto look around trying, prevent what she

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:37.800
 can. But on the first day of a new command, I think it is a coffin

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:45.260
 off it. On this walk, they will be over before you know, in a second

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:52.720
 you commit
