Okay, Work with someone. Spots someone assess a model who is willing to

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.510
 change versus those that will not change. Learned that by conducting

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:21.340
 your day in, day out watches. You know your mission. Your ship Is

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:28.170
 there somewhere you were only gonna figure that out, interacting with

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.000
 people in your watch and know. And it is important to know that there

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.830
 are personnel that, you know, they grew up on the analog took off

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:48.660
 and now also you want to go digital Were uncomfortable making the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.490
 trade. It's up to you, leader to say Okay, you guys do it. Just say

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:02.330
 what I want you, you, your house. It's a work with you to figure out

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:09.160
 that bounce you and it just sounds more people Good changes Change

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:15.990
 followed us said changes his change. Some people unstoppable change

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.820
 and there are others that are not help. Everyone deals with change.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.650
 That's what I do understand your mission. That won't be long. Hey,

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:36.480
 by the way, we're bringing in a new riverboat. Next. You know that riverboat

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:43.310
 is nothing like the old partners that we had and it has new

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:50.140
 engine for people that are trained on that. You didn't do it and I

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.970
 was awful for the mission
