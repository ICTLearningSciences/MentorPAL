00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.460
one question I would have asked earlier. Well, I did, Huh? I will. That's

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.060
 not something I was never shy about asking questions. And frankly,

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.670
 I have been my my old man was a CV and World War two and my older

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.280
 brother Waas, possibly five, at a neighbor's cat. And while the old

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.880
 adage is never volunteer for anything in the military, one thing I

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.490
 never found any hesitation. I never had any hesitation about asking

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:40.100
 a few years. Ask me senior officer's questions because A they wanted

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.710
 to buy you a beer. Now it is by your coffee, Okay, But you want to

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.310
 go and ask a lot of questions because they have for gotten war. I have

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.920
 gotten more than you have learned to date. So if anything and we

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.530
 learned this mentoring session go as high students, there's somebody

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.130
 out there they have made their mistakes, would like to pass that knowledge

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.740
 on to you, and I would say, Do not be afraid to ask questions.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.350
 There are no dumb questions. They literally are dumb questions because

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.950
 someone has done it and they don't want you to make a mistake

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.560
 in the future.
