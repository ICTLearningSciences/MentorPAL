00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.300
it's junior officer aboard your ship before it's gonna be a very important

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.750
 for you to earn the trust and respect of men and women in your

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.200
 division. One of the easiest things to do for that is to get up, get

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.650
 out of your stay out of the water along. Go along the debts off your

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.100
 personnel, go follow the messages of the watch. And I'm not just talking

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.550
 about your initial qualifications that you would have to do is

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.990
 part of your peak US, your personal qualifications stand personal

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.440
 provocation system, US points. Am I talking about getting points? I'm

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.890
 talking about getting out and you know, you want to turn in for the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.340
 night. You got one more hour of rack time or do you want to go walk

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.790
 the deck? You'll find the message of the watch will climb down light

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.240
 mine shaft bearing, you know, go take the loot wall temperatures.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.690
 Okay. And do that for every launch chef bearing on your ship. That

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.140
 is easy. Just walking the deck management by walking around, walking

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.590
 around and checking out on what you're moving. So you actually won.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.040
 It's important for you to learn your ship Every ship is different.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.490
 Laid out a little bit different. All ships line. They're supposed to

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.940
 be laid out the same, but some are not. It is. You're in combat If

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.390
 you have to go down to a given space and check something else flooding

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.840
 damage control. The only way to do that is by walking around. What

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.280
 better way to hurt? You know, trust and respect of your personal else

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.730
 by walking it with them. For example, you give not divisional officer

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:06.180
 level. But as a chief engineer, we're getting ready to launch

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.630
 the RHIB and your every ship will have on away boat. In this case, most

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.080
 of them all. The ridge we had just gotten to the ship's. So we had

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.530
 a launch. The RHIB, while part of a peace do after that is you tested

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.980
 Once there was a conflict in the instructions. The bullets in base

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.430
 at the best engine. But the Gangsters, the plant maintenance system

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.880
 is do not test. Without water flowing on, the most middle watch

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.330
 could have damage the ship. Once that was explained to May, we wrote

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.780
 a procedure to take care of that and get it and the A Gator. Oh, yeah.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.230
 The ship won't be damaged. Everything and that He put the word out.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.680
 The engineer stuck on 48 hangars over with Postmates. So engineers

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.120
 win. I didn't score one. Most amazing. So I was a farmer. I do, but

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.570
 just there's gonna be a lot of examples. Where? Mushroom walking

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:17.020
 a while. You won't find these examples. If you stay in your state grow

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.470
 if you stay in the water. Okay. You're not gonna want your shit.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.920
 You're not gonna learn that. It is not a good way to start your career.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.370
 You want to walk around, You want to know your shit, You want you.
