00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.130
I socialize outside of work. That's interesting. You do want to socialize

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:13.420
 with your wardrobe. I've always found that because you are one ship,

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.700
 one team won't wardroom my father's record recollections. My 30

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.990
 year tour are the four ships and we won't go up. We had a lot of parties

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:32.270
 back in the day, and also we would underway in a port way would

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.560
 put a pretty much with the warder. You're really tight with your wardrobe

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.840
 Now. There would be official ship's functions where you know

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.130
 the division that party way would have division Christmas parties on

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:57.410
 the bigger ships. You have multiple parties. There are departments

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.700
 get together. So I thought that too. I will say they want one thing.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.980
 No one really likes having to go to a party of being directed to go

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:16.270
 party. So if I was the senior officer at the parties, I would arrive

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.550
 first, arrive on time scheduled time. But I'd also be first and but

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.840
 the crew party. So it sze about them. You never want to be seen with

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.120
 dictatorial. They work for you during the day, you know, let them

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.410
 have their time off. And so that's a delicate balance that you have

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:47.690
 to find
