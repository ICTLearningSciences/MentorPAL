How often will you have to move in your career? So my classmate from Naval

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.690
 Academy, four balls from Brooklyn, They've created lives, actually,

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:21.610
 a lot of 84th Street. And up until we were department heads, Dave

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:28.530
 had moved twice. I move 11 times that. Yeah. Now Dave is Vice admiral,

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:35.450
 deputy for Stratcom. He said the move a couple of times now, war

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:42.370
 since since we've been department heads together, um, the Navy is

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:49.300
 trying to do homesteading, and I'm standing is good for the whole.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:56.220
 There's no stigma attached to steady. It's if you get it. But first

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:03.140
 and foremost, it's needs off the Navy most of the needs, but not always

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:10.060
 gonna be in the hole for you. It means that the Navy is just that

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.980
 which applies. I wouldn't be where they need you. That's you go with

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:23.900
 need. Yet they kind of go yet you know your next duty station afterwards.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:30.820
 So you hope about the details should help you out
