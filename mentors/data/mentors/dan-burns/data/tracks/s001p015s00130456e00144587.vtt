00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:08.640
01 Almost dangerous things. The job training Great Lakes for part of damage

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:16.430
 control. School centigrade lights for firefighters and way had

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:24.230
 to learn. I personally want to go hot. You gotta fight a fire. I prefer

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:32.020
 to be number 1000 to know what it's gonna take to know how long

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:39.810
 I could take it. Something turned up there was going to do that. That's

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:47.600
 about anything that was physically dangerous. Um, those times when

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:55.400
 I had one of the aircraft crash on deck when I had a crash explosion

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:03.190
 on deck without operation was a lot of shit on the last example.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:10.980
 Physically dangerous. Naoto, our connection from our to the ship blew

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:18.770
 up on the second ship on that far had to be put out. Obviously it's

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:26.570
 Charlie Fire Wade, isolate our fire out. So you see here normally

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:34.360
 also bomb. It's exciting. Every now and again, it isn't dangerous.
