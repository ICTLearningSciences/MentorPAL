00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.700
my first major leadership gold. Upon graduating from the Naval Academy,

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.550
 I attended division officer school in car Narrow California. And from

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:21.410
 there I went to my first ship. Was his aga out of Long Beach, California

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:28.260
 That four is now closed down. But at the time in the eighties,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.110
 I was very busy Port and I actually flew to Philippines. So meet

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:41.960
 my ship. I was assigned at the engineering department as a main machinery

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.810
 officer. And so I spent the next my days deployed on the ship,

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:55.660
 qualifying as it insuring. Also watch no, isn't Yao and then leading

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:02.520
 I had a department signs. I'm sorry. Division assigned me off roughly

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.370
 80 men. Uh, way were a single sex ship. That one warrant merged

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:16.220
 l A female. It was just the way that that ship was filled out and fitted

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:23.070
 out with personnel. Um and so I had the crew on my machinist Bates

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.920
 assign tweet. Two different famous sherry plant. One name, she

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.770
 replied over too. So a lot of time down there, qualifying. And and then

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.630
 we were, as I said, deployed so from the Philippines and civic,

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:50.480
 I went, uh, with the ship award and I got to go to Singapore, Hong Kong,

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:57.330
 Korea, Hawaii and back to Long Beach. So a lot of steaming during

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:04.180
 that first seat, as in engineering ulcer.
