00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.760
So it's as part of the listening drills. You'd be issued the plan of the

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:14.660
 dead, and you'll be in quarters you'll read off the planet today.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:21.570
 Somehow, someway, someone your division will not here. Yeah, and somehow,

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.470
 some way fat day either Your department head, XO seals will come

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.380
 on by and ask that person. So what's going on today? Personally

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:42.280
 asked. Is your team member who hasn't heard a plan of the day? You'd

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:49.190
 be surprised how often that happens or not. People will complain. I

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:56.090
 didn't get the word is always so ways to get the word out before smartphones

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:03.000
 before tablets. Before I had a simple plan right off. Tell

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.900
 everyone what they're doing and what's going on. Um, you know, that's

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.810
 not change even in the smartphone Europe. And as we gets beyond smartphones

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:23.710
 beyond, beyond smart from us, someone is still not getting

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:30.620
 here. So what do you do yet? You point out correctly. Did you see

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:37.520
 the light of day post on? Okay, right behind me. Why today? Right there.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.430
 What's going on? But if you haven't as division officer taking

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.330
 time to post fell plan on the day you have a problem so no, you need

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:58.240
 to make sure that it's available. You could point to a place that interested.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:05.140
 It's in the ship's plan of the day file, and here's the U.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:12.050
 R L. But if you can't find that your responsibility now, if you got

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.950
 it and they continuously, don't read it. But I have a talk with the

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.860
 body. Also watch. Try to come over the better strategy with first

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.760
 thing is make sure you have it posted.
