00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.920
So what type of questions you asked me about? Or New York Mets dominating?

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.990
 The Dodgers is always available to talk about that's the 1986 Mets

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.060
 2000 world Siris. In some ways, there is happy to talk about. Those

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.140
 probably reached me offline for further comment on that over for

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.210
 the tapes and recordings that you're going to see Click on Head. It's

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.280
 really about challenges that you like face in the first sea duty

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.350
 that field, too, uh, life at sea worship driver because I am sure on

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.420
 it's based on my experiences there. You also can ask questions about

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.490
 housing. You know, you move from base debates like these questions

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:01.560
 in their cover. That and just a general illusion questions leadership

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:07.640
 style questions because we know you've had that textbook at this

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.710
 point, either. At O. C s war, CIA knows reading list. They want not

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.780
 what? There's gonna be some questions that you can want one look on

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.850
