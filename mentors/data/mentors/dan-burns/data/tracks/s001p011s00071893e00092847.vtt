00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.740
So we're going reporting seniors that are registered to give feedback

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.630
 to you. You the junior officer, in this case, you're the junior officer,

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.510
 and you're carrying out daily mission. And you're gay crickets

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.400
 from the chain of command. Okay, well, one thing crickets is usually

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.290
 a sign off. You. You're okay. Because people will lay like a ton of

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:36.180
 Rex on personnel and team members that are performance. So in this

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.070
 case, you know your hearing nothing. Well, is that bad or good? First

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.960
 off, you might want to sit down. You're going to have formal get togethers

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.840
 either at morning quarters daily. Sit down with the XO. Planning

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.730
 for for training to be a T, you know will be official times meetings,

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.620
 and you could just or launch, you know, one of the meals. You

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.510
 can have a couple cars, eh? So I just wanna make sure we're okay.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.400
 You know this direction? I'm going in. I have heard nothing back, so

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.280
 I'm gonna continue our forces. Speed told directs otherwise, and I

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.170
 don't believe I'm heading into the rocks. That's always one way to do

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.060
 it. It's not necessarily a bad sign. If you're not getting feedback

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.950
 It's just in this day and age. Frankly, everyone's busy, so you're

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.840
 not broke. I'm not gonna fix you. And therefore, I'm not created me

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.730
 back for the most part, especially that so I don't have to fix things

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:58.610
 that are broke before fixing in a bar. Feedback. That's always the

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.500
 case. But I'm saying you can operate that, but you might want to check.
