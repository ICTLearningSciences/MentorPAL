 fallout one guide fifteen commands so roughly at seventeen that stole

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.980
 from the beginning and of the seventeen there's only three of the

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.670
 seventeen that I would say I would not go back to it would not go

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.360

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.870
 bringing their the outlook for because you don't want to be labeled

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.560
