WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.540
assignment. That is not a good fit. So, you know, we've got each command

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:14.230
 is roughly two years. We've got 10 to years commands. If you're gonna

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:20.920
 deal with 20 years, that time you're gonna after Mads that you're

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:27.610
 gonna like and have a talk myself. A 30 year career. By that logic,

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:34.290
 I had 15 commands. So roughly at 17 commands told from fuck the beginning

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.980
 and off the 17. There's only three of the 17 that I would say

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.670
 I would not go back to. I would not go back to that. I did. I hope

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.360
 you have a lovely like that you're joining. But when you're enduring

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.050
 those 3 17 are not comfortable. What? What if you will draw in the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.740
 Navy to see the world have a great war? I want some fun along the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.430
 way. Or are you doing frankly? What are you thinking? Deliveries. If

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.120
 it's a personnel offline, you or the other person is going to roll.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:27.810
 Thank you. Your throat. Then don't watch anyone stand off two years.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.500
 Frankly, if they're out of cycle means just a year before that person

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.180
 or persons changed out. So best thing to do at that point is, Brendan

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.870
 Barrett. That tour because you don't want to be labeled as the

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.560
 problem child. Couldn't get it done. So do your tour serve the nation?

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.250
 Remember, this is one of my fright. Seven things. Well, okay, that's

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.940
 okay. You do that because the other 14 gonna be a test. That's

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:14.630
 a pretty good bad marriage.
