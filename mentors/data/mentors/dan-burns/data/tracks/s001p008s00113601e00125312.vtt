00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:09.420
something for me as a service warfare officer Looking back on 30 years,

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:17.990
 and I'd like to have done no better start off one of things. I like

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:26.550
 to take a lesson out of my older cultures should he was environment

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:35.120
 with the N y. Uh, and I was coming down with a farm arms walk through

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:43.690
 fire. You do not run too hard if you run and on a strong shoot from

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:52.260
 the hip, you get burned getting shot at that walk. Slowly evaluate

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:00.820
 a walk and don't stop walking because you saw you will get hurt.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:09.390
 It's swallowed up by heart. Walk into a situation. Yes, you got your

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:17.960
 head figured out sharp course or out of quarters.
