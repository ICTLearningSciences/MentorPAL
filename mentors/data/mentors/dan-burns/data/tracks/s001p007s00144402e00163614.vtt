00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.460
so as far as management of civilian and military personnel of course so

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.060
 if you have to distinguish between the civilian personnel other contractors

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.670
 both of the civil and so a lot more invested in the contractors

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.270
 and the contractors are only legally bound to their so there are

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.880
 three players in that in that case help with and the other thing

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.490
 that you need to know and understand the bills are there probably would

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:40.090
 be inside the lifelines should gets under way everyone's on the

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.700
 civilians may or may not be getting away with it the size and shape

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.300
 because there are some things that you know the way we use a big dictators

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.910
 and look at our well the for the most part so when you guys first

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.520
 not getting on the way Bob partnerships for so you have to understand

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.120
 what the mission and one of the dealer and then situational eight

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.730
 it's different when you should be out we went to the shipyard you

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.330
 know well when the when the bowel or also is this still the shipyard

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.940
 also the one responsible for sure you for but technically you know

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.550
 the dry dock captive opens the ship with that and the contractors

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.150
 are in charge of all goods and love the show and it's the only new

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.760
 core of it maybe that should be better so at that point the contractors

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.360
 become poor very poor soaring into being a bit intermediate maybe

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.970
 it's available is the I am a
