00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.190
so a CE faras management of civilian and military personnel yourself,

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.530
 you have to distinguish between the civilian personnel off the contractors,

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.870
 Resilient said. A lot more invested than the contractors, and

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:22.210
 the contractors are only legally bound to their contract. So there

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.550
 are three players in that in that case, helping you. And the other

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.880
 thing that you need to know. I understand military they're covered with

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.220
 inside the lifelines. That ship gets underway. Everyone's underwear.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.560
 Civilians may or may not be getting underway with depending upon

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.900
 the size ship, because there are so civilians, that big deck aiders

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.240
 and on the carriers. But for the most part, civilian contractors,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.580
 they're not getting under way with not on a ship spurt. So do you have

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.920
 to understand what the mission is? What are they doing? And then

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.260
 situationally? It's different. When you entered shipyard, you enter

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.600
 the shipyard, you know, Remember when the when the bow crosses Cecil

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.940
 off the shipyard, commanding officers don't want responsible. The ship

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.270
 was responsible course, but technically, you know the dry dock captain

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.610
 over his ship that on the contractors are charge of breaking

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.950
 down kids cutting up the ship. It's stalling New equipment and making

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.290
 that shift better. So at that point, the contractors become important

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.630
 very during into being with intermediate maintenance of Elba. Lucy.
