00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.750
So when I sing right now, maybe is the exceptional family remember program?

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.650
 And if their special needs, then they will keep you in the area

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.560
 that you need to be close to a hospital. Uh, just for instance, one

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.460
 of my shipmates is, uh we had five boys and they all had a congenital

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.360
 defect in stomach lining and had to have special food bags. Just

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.260
 eat to stay alive and so he could have deployed. You cannot deploy

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.160
 overseas. He needed to be in an area where those food bags were available.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.070
 So exceptional Family member planning. If you have that that's

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.970
 applicable to your family, then the Navy is gonna go out this way.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.870
 Make that happen.
