00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.510
d'oh assignment. That is not a good fit. So you know, you've got each

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:14.180
 command is roughly two years. We've got 10 to years commands. But you're

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:20.840
 gonna deal with a 20 year during that time. You know you're gonna

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:27.500
 after Mads, that you're gonna like and have a talk myself. A 30 year

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:34.170
 career. By that logic, I had 15 commands. So roughly at 17 commands

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.830
 told from the beginning And of the 17 there's only three of the

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:47.490
 17 that I would say I would not go back to. I would not go back to that.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:54.160
 I did. Um, I hope you have a lovely like you're joining. But when

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:00.820
 you're enduring those 3 17 are not comfortable, not fun, if you will,

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:07.480
 was drawn the navy to see the world and have a great toe with some

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:14.150
 fun along the way. Or are you doing frankly? What are you doing?

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.810
 One thing your lover is if it's a personnel offline, you or the other

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.480
 person is goingto thank you your throat. I don't want anyone to stand

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:34.140
 off for two years, but frankly, if they're out of cycle means just

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.800
 a year before that person or persons changed out. So best thing

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.470
 to do at that point is Brendan Barrett tour. But you don't want to be

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:54.130
 labeled as the problem, child. Couldn't get it done. So do your tour

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.790
 serve the nation? Remember, I This is one of my flight out of 17.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:07.460
 Well, okay, that's okay. You can do that because the other 14 gonna

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:14.120
 be passed. That's a pretty good bad.
