00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.400
you know, I was reloading strategies for you to be present with your team.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.940
 You know, the books will have all kinds of recommendations for

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.490
 personally in my time. And I had read a lot way had a lot of leadership

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.030
 examples falls, but I still think the easiest one is VW A management

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.580
 by walking around that shows that your present you stay in your

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.130
 state room. If we stay in, the longer you stay in the wardroom of the

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.670
 bridge, don't get down to your spaces. Okay? That's gonna be noticed.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.220
 So the best way to be present is to be brother. Go out and walk

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.760
 the decks with your team with your master chief petty officer with

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.310
 your leading petty officer. Get out and about because they're also help.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.860
 You were when you first report to the ship, that's the best thing

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.400
 to do. Walk around with everyone in the chain of command, okay? And

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.950
 see it and try to understand where all your Spence is off. Because

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.490
 again, they are all your spaces and so you don't want to miss it space.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.040
 So the best way to do that is to walk around with Chief Petty

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.580
 officer and Petty officer. Heavy officer should see all your spaces.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.130
 A lot Also. What? They have a point out by doing that? Yeah. When captain

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.680
 turns over the ship that he has to turn over every space on the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.220
 ship to his relief and every space to sign for it. You don't want

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.770
 to be the officer that pulls space. Oops. You That's going to get you

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.310
 in the hot seat really quick. So the best way to do that is to walk

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.860
 around.
