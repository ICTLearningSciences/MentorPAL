00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.630
So I moved 17 times in my baby seventies. It's a lot of ghosts. Frankly,

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:12.400
 before I was married, I I didn't have a care I would move anywhere

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.180
 to do to get the job. I wanted to be in California, all the shit those

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.950
 born and raised in Brooklyn. So I took the first ship I could find

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:29.730
 out of the West Coast. After that, the detailers would call me and

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.510
 say, You've done a bang up job and now we've got a tour for you on

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.280
 the USS Fife on the life was coming out of the yards. San Diego and

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.060
 going to you. Chris, get your pants. So that was a change of whole

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.830
 port, which you may or may not experience again. You're your time.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:58.610
 So the other. In my time, there was a lot of moving around. The idea

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.380
 of home standing and staying in one port really wasn't a tool that

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:10.160
 was available. Now they tried A It's a key personnel in the home port

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.940
 to minimize the amount of moves, but frankly, it can be done. It has

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.710
 done a lot for personnel that are assigned to you. Goose get to Seventh

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.490
 Fleet to fifth Fleet once they move you out there, they like

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.260
 to keep you there. So they'll move your back to Goto farm ahead school

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:39.040
 to go to XO school, go to see other school, but they'll send you

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.820
 right back to you. Kuska, um, and or fifth fleet war out to six Fleet

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.590
 in the med. So the nice thing about that Homestake pieces, it's easier

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.370
 on the family staying home. If you happen to be married, you're

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:02.140
 not married. You know pretty much you're gonna pack your seat back,

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.920
 your tenant double where you where you want to go. And that's if you're

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.690
 If you're not married, you If you are married, this goes back to

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.470
 John. Paul Jones joins Navy. If you're willing to travel, they will

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.250
 send. You don't want to travel. You can figure out a way to stay in

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.020
 the whole board. It's it's more walking around and finding a job before

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.800
 the detailers will work with you to keep you there if if so desired.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.570
 Personally, I as I said, I moved 17 times like a lot, so I I

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.350
 didn't have a problem
