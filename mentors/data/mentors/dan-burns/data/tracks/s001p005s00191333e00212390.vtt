00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.530
So, as a division officer, you're going to be out at sea on your ship.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:12.200
 And this would apply also two aviators when they do with disassociated

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.880
 see tours or the submariners when they come topside when they're

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.560
 trying to qualify for there, carry cvb G the carrier ballot Cruise

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.230
 tours. You have to do a tour of the ship, one of things about life,

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.910
 and see when the carrier goes out your signs to carrier battle group,

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.590
 you Miss Navy Prize itself on under waiver punishments on one of these.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.270
 Do you have to develop? Is your seaman's eye to make sure that

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.940
 you could bring your ship alongside? I did the carrier or the replenishment

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.620
 ship. And that's the one thing that ship drivers surface warfare

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.300
 officers pride themselves on is learning how to drive that ship

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.970
 and keep that ship alongside their punishment. Because you don't want

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.650
 to crash into or play bumper cars. That is not good at all. So or

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.330
 just, uh, underwear your punishment I had I was in the Bering Sea's

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.000
 that's north of Alaska. First ship. We took it. We went up the West

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.680
 Coast. What through the Bering Sea's into the illusions, and we did

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.360
 it underwear punishment for eight hours. And I had the con for about

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.040
 six of those eight hours that's developing your seaman's. I. That's

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.710
 the kind of thing that you is very hard to do. But once completed,

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.390
 once you have that a everyone knows you're the you're the guy. You're

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.070
 the gal that could drive that ship. Well, the guy you're the gal,

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.740
 go out and keep the ship out of harm's away. That's very sensible.
