00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:08.110
first team to meet Sanders. This is one of the times when it's gonna depend

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:15.360
 on the situation. Tell you that one team that I had to leave was

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.620
 on that ship Sailed. What years were actually fired? I was. So at

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:29.880
 that point, the team is gonna have to do it my way. My way is by the

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:37.140
 book. My way was to get help in and make sure that we were using the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:44.390
 mobile training teams eyes, carrot, out exercises, any equipment

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:51.650
 to speak. You sure that we understood technology and carry out drills

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:58.910
 on That was a long slog. It was a very long to do that. I can tell

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:06.170
 you that at the end of the day should earn the engineer. He learned

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:13.420
 that 12 years leave the only trophy that was in the days when only

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:20.680
 one ship this water was a fleet of shit. So it was about a situation.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:27.940
 If you're more than a situation where Dean is right, you have a copy

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:35.200
 and just passed. Right? Trey, Everything's great. They built with

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.450
 centered Sam. Just stay up on that Raiders EJ, stay tight. Stay sharp.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.710
 Don't slack off
