00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.990
What warning signs should you not try to solve forward. Okay. This date

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:15.130
 age right now are the best team leader. You're the best person in

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:22.270
 charge to be aware off team members of the team. So when I was a captain,

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:29.400
 uh, Post grad school a lot of suicides at that point, maybe wide,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.540
 it's all there. Okay? One should be aware off your team what they

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.680
 doing? Okay, a little sudden, you know, they're acting strange. One

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.820
 of further up the chain of command. If you have a question about anyone's

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.960
 mental health, there they are. Okay. Divorces. Sadly, they haven't

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.100
 okay, but a divorce all of a sudden, that effects effects person's

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.230
 mental health deaths the same way. So it's our mom. Dad, Sister,

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:19.370
 brother alone. A sudden mental health aspect to that point. Don't

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:26.510
 let the exit of the bomber had the Excelsior 40 change the way you

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:33.650
 get a chaplain over asking questions. You do not wanna land on two person

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:40.790
 team member land on, then they're not gonna feel secure. It's

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.930
 gonna be even worse, you know? Say, Hey, Jones. Stephen Jones. I'm a

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:55.070
 cup of coffee with chapel, right? Don't talk to her. so Axel office.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:02.200
 These often put this. It's probably a better way to do it and you'll

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:09.340
 get there. Firstly, I've only had I've had one suicide, one of my

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:16.480
 ships, my four ships and I've had three deaths. Way had a watch a live

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.620
 person take their souls have to be aware of.
