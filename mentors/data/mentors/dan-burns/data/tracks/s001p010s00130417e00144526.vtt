00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:09.270
most dangerous things of everything the job training okay the Great Lakes

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:17.700
 for part of damage control schools so that for far five and we had

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:26.120
 to learn hi personally all hot you've got to fight a fire I prefer

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:34.550

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:16.670
