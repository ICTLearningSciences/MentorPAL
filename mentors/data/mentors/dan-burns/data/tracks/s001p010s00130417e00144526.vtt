00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:09.270
So one almost dangerous things. The job training Great Lakes for part

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:17.700
 of damage control School centigrade waits for and way had to learn how

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:26.120
 I personally want to go hot there. You gotta fight a fire. I prefer

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:34.550
 to be No. $1. You know what it's gonna take to know how long I could

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:42.970
 take it? Seven earned. Result up there, do that. That's about anything

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:51.400
 that was physically dangerous. Um, times when I had one. The

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:59.820
 aircraft crashed on deck when I crash. Explosion on deck Help was a

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:08.240
 lot of shift on the last example. Physically dangerous. You know, it's

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:16.670
 our confession from our to the ship. Blew up on the second ship on

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:25.090
 that far. Had to be put out. Obviously it's Charlie Fire way had Eisley

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:33.520
 our fire out. So you hear. Normally it's exciting every day, isn't

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:41.940
 it?
