00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.120
how I handle self doubt. Um, yeah. There's gonna be times in your career.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.400
 You gonna wonder why am I out here? Why am I doing this job? I'll

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.670
 tell you a lot of nights. And if I were wearing my uniform right now,

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.950
 my ribbons on city, I see service deployed with four pins on it.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:32.220
 Four oak leaves on it, which stands for two years for deployed away

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.500
 from the country with my family, with my whole underway at sea. Another

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.770
 year pin earned for Japan. So technically, I was away for three

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:51.050
 years from the States. Anyway, the thing is nice. Worshipped robbery

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.320
 at night. You look up at the stars, you can see the stars. You know

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.600
 what you're doing. You know your mission. I always like to look back

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.870
 for the ship from sugars on the way. And you have shifted colors

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:16.150
 from the fantail to the main mass and the ship is underway. You see

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.420
 old glory flying. It's flying because you're there. Nor mission. Part

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.700
 of what you're doing is keeping that flag and showing that for it's

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.970
 always been. Um, I was advised officers will have a chance in Washington,

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.250
 D. C. by and see all the monuments. Good bye and looking like.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.520
 And look at the Washington Monument. Look at what they did back then.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.800
 Is that smart? Okay, they did a lot. So they knew what they did.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.070
 I think I try to stay motivated to do.
