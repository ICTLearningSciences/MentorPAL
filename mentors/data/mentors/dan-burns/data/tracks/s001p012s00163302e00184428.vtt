How do you enforce the other? Okay, well, to assume that everyone's vicious

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:15.430
 species I always got the damage was really not. Everyone has gone

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:22.730
 down. So I put on the West. How do you ensure that your team, you

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:30.020
 know, it's honorable leading their mission. That's simple. Expect

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:37.310
 or you personally inspects. So if the next watch they were supposed

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:44.600
 to bring on, you know, bring number two boiler at a lay up and getting

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:51.900
 ready to go online on the old 400 watch and you come up I had four

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:59.190
 hundreds. Take the watch and the ball is not, uh, what's going on.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.480
 Okay, so it's things like that. You know, if all of a sudden you know

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:13.770
 things are not happening, we're supposed to. That's an indication.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:21.060
 So you have to turn around and, you know, enforce it. Okay, um, we

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.360
 were supposed to have all the ships boats stowed away, and then everyone

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.650
 could go on the recall ships boats on stowed away taking the watch.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:42.940
 You could keep the watch. Do you still little boats away? So that's

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:50.230
 an indicator. It's hard. It's not like the battery. It's not academy

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:57.530
 environment. Fleet is not the academy, so but waken still expect

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:04.820
 that you would bring duty, honor, country, honor. Fidelity Integrity's

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:12.110
 with you
