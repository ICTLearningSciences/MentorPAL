00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.420
was the most difficult part of my training so I I as a chief engineer

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.990
 I I chose engineering halfway form for my career there were things about

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.560
 that is it's very much hands on and you have to learn the hands

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.130
 on you have to see I had to see it we we had to do a lot of other ways

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.700
 of the gas turbine engines to see what the air flow walls is and

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.270
 how you can generate the powers of the gas turbine and how closely

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.850
 caster manager of all it's really cold here all the way out to look

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.420
 for power that moves the ship if you go from standing still two thirty

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.990
 two knots at flank speed over with thirty two knots about forty miles

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:56.560
 an hour and you can do that in order a minute with a guest or which

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.130
 you've got to keep all that information in your head and and how

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.700
 to do that the same thing could be applied through cyber attacks for

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.270
 the operations officer for the cryptologist how do you maintain if

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.840
 you've got to go ahead and see all
