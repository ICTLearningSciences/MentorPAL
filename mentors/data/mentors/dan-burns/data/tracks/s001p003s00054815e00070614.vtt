00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.420
what was the most difficult part of my training? So I as a chief engineer,

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.990
 I chose the engineering halfway for my career. One of things about

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.560
 that is it's very much hands on and you have to learn the hands

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.130
 on. You have to see. I had to see it way had to do a lot of cutaways

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.700
 off the gas turbine engines to see what the airflow waas is and how

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.270
 you could generate the power to the gas turbine and how it goes from

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.850
 the gas turbine engine room away through the whole year away out of

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.420
 the propeller that moves the ship that you go from standing still

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.990
 to 32 knots at flank speed 32 knots in about 40 miles an hour. You could

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:56.560
 do that in under a minute. With a gas turbine ship. You've got

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.130
 to keep all that information in your head and how to do that. The same

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.700
 thing could be applied through cyber attacks for the operations officer

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.270
 for the cryptologist. How do you maintain you've got to go ahead
