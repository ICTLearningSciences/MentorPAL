00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:08.740
So we got my priorities with Chang commands authorities First way are

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:16.620
 not a Praetorian guard. You're going to carry out awful orders. That

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:24.510
 is war to carry out the lawful orders of those appointed authority

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:32.390
 of guards. What happened to Rome as a result of what happened that they

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:40.280
 did in history. So your parties are your seniors for our sins documented?

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:48.160
 Move on. You're not gonna carry out more. I can't think of

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:56.050
 a time right now. We're a super awesome going.
