00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.760
a typical day for May out, it seems to be getting up. Morning breakfast,

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:12.670
 probably going to morning quarters, getting the word of the day for

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.580
 you have a mission. I would then have a watch to stand in the engineering

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.490
 spaces or house. I'll bridge our combat information center,

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.410
 standing watch four hours or so, and then going down and doing my administrative

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.320
 work and walking around my space is, uh, lunch rolling

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.230
 to dinner and then have another watch. I stand the watch and then of,

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.140
 but mainly today was to watches and watches be off before he watches.
