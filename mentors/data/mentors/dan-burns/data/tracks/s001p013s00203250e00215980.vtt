Okay, so what kind of sailors pose problems? You know, if if there was

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:13.320
 a magic, you know, class glasses that you put on c be great. Made a

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.560
 lot of money. Saw that one there isn't necessarily Someone can identify.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.790
 We're gonna find them. One of things about that is you wanna be

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:32.030
 careful with your time This time is the one thing that you have very

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:38.260
 little off. If you wind up, try to spend 90% of your time on 10%

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.500
 of your problem Children. Okay. What about the other 90% that are so?

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.740
 This is the the balance that you're going to have to come up with

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:56.970
 as a leader. Treat Everyone fairly goes about saying, treat them fairly.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:03.210
 But if the troublemakers are out there just now, I'm not saying

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.440
 ignore them. But be careful about the rest of the unit arrested with

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.680
 division. Because if you wind up spending all right for the one percenters,

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.910
 you're going to lose the rest of your division. So that's

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:28.150
 a hard thing to work at balance. But it will pay off
