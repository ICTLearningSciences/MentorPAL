00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:09.470
so things that I've done really well as a leader maybe, um so belly. Absolutely,

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:18.080
 Very well. I always live on my executive officers. My second

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:26.700
 hands leaders any awesome petty officers to out a execute division

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:35.320
 combat mission. So well, I actually felt well what I've been told

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:43.930
 that he's writing fit reps on writing. You need the war's just official,

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:52.550
 maybe language. It's tiresome having, perhaps for years. But you

00:00:52.550 --> 00:01:01.160
 did, and you just can't give. If you've got a division of the Department

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:09.780
 of Heart 50 personnel, you can't just use one. What if it attacks?

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:18.400
 That doesn't work. People are not gonna trust you felt down.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:27.010
 So writing the figure up told is more art than sites are right. And

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:35.630
 that's how you write. Take care, Ward your men life, Robert
