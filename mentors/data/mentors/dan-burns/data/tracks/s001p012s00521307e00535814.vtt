00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.030
benefits can you take advantage of as a junior officer of the education,

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:13.210
 Go get your master's degree on the Navy. The Navy pay for that? Um,

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:19.390
 if you want a little, you know, I am a ship driver. I did have an

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.570
 opportunity early on. Was that moderate? I could have changed Group

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.750
 Pass. They were looking for nuclear reactor officers. At that point,

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.930
 I did not want to go to a carrier. That was all it was. A lot of junior

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:44.110
 class cruisers were gone that for So I did not want to go with

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:50.290
 your power. I will say, if you are top 4% e key on your fit ruts. You

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.480
 know, you want to think about a switch. You know, you could be a

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.660
 doctor. After 30 years, you can be a dentist. You know, you can Holt

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.840
 easy anymore. So that's kind of interesting. You know, we're unrestricted

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.020
 line officers. That's mainly I'm talking to this point under

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.200
 strict line, but if you after serving some good tours beside, you know

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.380
 that's an option, you go to hell to send in tow. It's selected by,

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.560
 you know, the detailers in transition over to medical, dental, nurse,

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.740
 medical service score. It's a great life. We take advantage of the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.920
 situation
