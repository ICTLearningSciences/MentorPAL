There's always some common misconceptions about my field. I'll say you're

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.900
 very funny. Misconception. Um, when I was on my first ship as a

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.430
 lieutenant, we had a congressional delegation code. Come aboard the

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.960
 ship and the code out use civilians. Staffers that work for congressman

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.480
 were six congressmen and approximately 15 staffers. And two of the

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.010
 staffers thought that as naval officers and sailors, we didn't pay

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.540
 any taxes. Hey, that's it. Excuse me? Um, no. Uh, Garson. In fact,

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.060
 let me show you. And I got disbursing. Officer brought him into the

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.590
 conversation, brought out what's called a leave and earnings statement

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.120
 in L E s and showed it. Looks to me like New York state tax in the

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.650
 federal tax income tax that I have to pay. So that was that was rather

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.170
 interesting. Uh, yes, we pay taxes well, as the next citizen in

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.700
 our country. So that was That was a funny anecdote that always struck

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.230
 me for some reason that that they think the military doesn't pay

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.750
 things way. Do we try toe Have a life just like our citizens that were

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.280
