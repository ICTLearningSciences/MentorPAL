00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.240
it was one to recover from a professional bumping. So you try not to be

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:13.630
 zero defect. We try very hard. That means you're gonna make the states.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:20.020
 So the first thing is usually seen. Top gun. Remember towards

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:26.420
 that, you do. You've got to get back in the saddle. You've got to get

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.810
 back up. You gotta try it yet you were going to be doing for ship's

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:39.200
 officers. You're going to be doing bullshit alongside station keeping.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.590
 Do not hit the other ship. What was her shoe? Times way have available?

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.980
 Did that especially was way refuelings. So you've got to rehearse

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.370
 it in your mother. You've gotta find time to go up on the bridge,

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.770
 Wayne, on the flying Bridge. Look down and watch this. Watch someone

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:11.160
 do the evolution so you could have it fresh in your mind when

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.550
 your turn comes to do a kind of exercise. So this thing when you do

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.940
 have a bump in the road a acknowledge it for training will evaluate

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:30.330
 the situation. Do not fight it, not fight that you went left when you

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.720
 shouldn't want right. Just acknowledge that you did for whatever reason,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.110
 and correct it. The next time corrected in training. Your engineer

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.510
 gotta do qualify as an engineer. Awesome. Watch. Just do another

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.900
 engine and drill. Get held in here making part of muscle. Okay, This

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:02.290
 you will have to do to get a part. That means acknowledging mistakes,

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:08.680
 getting up, doing it again.
