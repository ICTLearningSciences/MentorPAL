00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.620
when I was a may be different from the other branch of the military. It's

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.380
 the day's sail. They John Paul Jones. More thing about the Navy

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:21.150
 is way our suffer. Like when you even anger realize the other way it

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.920
 sell old arising. You are part of that crew are on that ship very independent,

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.680
 and it forces you to be mush wars. Would I have much more

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.450
 self reliant Then the Army or the Air Force officers got leads are

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:48.220
 part of the dates Said that Lorraine's. But frankly, the Air Force

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:54.980
 they return tone base. Okay, B to B 52 outstanding aircraft and they

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.750
 fly home. Everything okay? I'm out there in the middle of Pacific and

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:08.520
 I won't be home for a couple of months. So I had to make sure that

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.280
 I am relying on this. If they get a mission failure, just turn around.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.050
 Go home. The army. The army is reliant when they're out of garrison.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:28.820
 If they're out of garrison and there you didn't find on war, okay,

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.580
 but how money and yes, we've been fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:42.350
 for 18 years now, but for the most part, has special operations

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:49.120
 right now. That's not a big arm being. Always missions allowed or 23

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.880
 up, etcetera. Mom, there's a struggle on deploy on my bus. Okay, Take

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.650
 out the enemy. Returning to garrison. Okay, Navy goes out, spreads

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:09.420
 diplomacy. Lets the world know this is what America is all about.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:16.180
 And everyone wants to come to America. Still the number one destination

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.950
 for the planet.
