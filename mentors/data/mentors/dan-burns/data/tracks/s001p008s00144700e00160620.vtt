00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.940
or some warning signs of a team that they're gonna be problems ahead reporters

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:13.030
 ahead. Usually you can spot some of them. If the team is not

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:19.130
 performing its mission, it can't stand a watch. If the watch it is

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.220
 not quiet. Okay, You want a quiet watch. You want the watch to just

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.310
 turn over and everything happens on time. You switched the boiler's

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.400
 out. You switched the gas turbine generators from one outfit. One Bravo.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.500
 Yes, you bring on number three gas turbine generator and put number

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.590
 one and I left. If the team cannot carry that out without significant

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.680
 destroying motivation, consternation, that's a problem. So just

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.770
 stand in a watch, which means you need to watch you understand what

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.870
 a good watch this. Nothing happens. So enough of the Abbotts happens.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:13.960
 That's perfect for a C I. C. Watch officer. Nothing happened.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.050
 You execute the plan, so that's perfect. Nothing happens
