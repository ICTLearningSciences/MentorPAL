00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.550
What serves is are hard to find on the basis. So one thing right now with

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:12.250
 you know, the size of the force looking accordion growing, the one

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.940
 we're shrinking and what not? And so I found Well, I personally have

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.640
 all my medical needs. Met with docks and the dentist aboard the

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.340
 ship or the hospital hospital. Do you find that? You know, an O B G

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.040
 for my wife? Uh, that is easy to come by on pediatricians for the kids,

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.730
 not as easy to come by. And those, of course, are critical or family

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.430
 life stability. So you wanna try to investigate that as best you

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.130
 can get to you before you get to the station? And certainly you need

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.830
 to find out, Do they try there? Because it was pretty popular to

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:03.520
 take it, But right now you really want to investigate the docks that

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.220
 you're gonna have your family make sure they do. Take that right there.
