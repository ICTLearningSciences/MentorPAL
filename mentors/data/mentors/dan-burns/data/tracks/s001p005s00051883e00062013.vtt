This is the physical environment in which I worked. Buried at sea, enable

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.000
 ship and shook our environment. Aria in the engineering spaces was

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.570
 was on the conventional ships. Very hot way. Had stress programs,

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.140
 of course, But is there any spaces? Were man 25 hours a day, of course.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.710

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.290

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.860

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:51.000
 under way is very demanding. You have to be in shape. Physically

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.580
 fit. Well, that's one of the reasons we have. Ah, his memories.
