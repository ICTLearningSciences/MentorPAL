00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.920
It's a good resource is to look at while starting out. Remember the chief

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.980
 of Naval operations? See, you know, has his recommended reading

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.050
 list. Secretary of Defense. I have not seen his reading list lately.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.110
 Is the Secretary of Defense's acting at this point? But he will come

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:31.180
 out with his reading list. And most of the admirals and generals.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:37.240
 Probably the war. You know, we'll have a reading this. Okay, I read

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:43.310
 that. Okay. Uh, General Patton War to General Patton. What he wanted

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:49.370
 to West Point Had he survived a war to be sent back there. Leave West

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.440
 Point General one everyone to study history, history. History was

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.500
 not interested in engineering. That's that's very fascinating to hear

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.570
 from General Patton because he is the one that learned on his own

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.630
 how to move a tank. And that was a technological innovation from one

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.700
 World War two blood screen. Everything else was built around the tech.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.760
 He learned the tank, and yet he professes history. Read your history,

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.830
 learn the art of warfare because with every new technological

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.890
 innovation, you still have to have men and women behind that innovation

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.960
 to implement a strategy to implement the art of warfare That has

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.020
 a change. So study warfare, study your tactics, study your procedures.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.090
 Weren't those
