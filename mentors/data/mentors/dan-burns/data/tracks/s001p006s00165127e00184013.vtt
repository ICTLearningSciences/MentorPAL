00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:08.110
I first team to meet standards. This is one of the times when it's gonna

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:15.360
 depend on the situation. Tell you that one team that I had to leave

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.620
 was on that ship sailed. George here's actually fired What I was

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:29.880
 saying. So at that point, the team is gonna have to do it my way. My

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:37.140
 way is by the book. My way was to get help in and make sure that we

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:44.390
 were using the mobile training teams eyes who carried out the exercises,

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:51.650
 any equipment to speed. Make sure that we understood technology

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:58.910
 and carry out drills on time. That was a long slog. It was a very

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:06.170
 long fight to do that. I can tell you that at the end of the day should

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:13.420
 earn the engineer. He learned that 12 years, Ali. The only trophy

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:20.680
 that was in the days when only one ship this water was a fleet of

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:27.940
 ships. So does depend on the situation. If you're more than a situation

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:35.200
 where teams right. You have a copy on just past Raftery. Everything's

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.450
 great. They built with Sanders. Just stay up on that Raiders ej,

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.710
 stay tight. Stay sharp, Okay? Don't slack off
