I deal with stress. All the job. Um, personally, I'm a pig. And on three

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:15.490
 of my four shifts, I made sure that I was the person responsible

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:22.820
 or one of my officers or chaos Is someone in my team was responsible

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:30.140
 for the ship's Jim. I want to be available for that. So I did. You

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:37.460
 know you don't I Right away some stress. Use weights? Yes. Wait. We

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.780
 just had our in place. What you have. Perhaps you have reluctantly friendly.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:52.100
 Couldn't choose doctors in a steel deck. That car's we would

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:59.430
 do sit ups and pushups on death economically. Probably that good for

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:06.750
 the body. Stress wise. You know, you do 1000 push ups. That's good.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.070
 Forget the stress out.
