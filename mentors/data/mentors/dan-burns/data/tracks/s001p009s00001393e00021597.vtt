00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.400
you know, I was reloading strategies for you to be present with your team.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.940
 You know, books will have all kinds of recommendations for personally.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.490
 In my time, I have read a lot way had a lot of leadership examples

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.040
 falls, but I still think the easiest long is N v w A management

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.590
 by walking around that shows that your present you stay in your state

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.130
 room. If you stay in, the longer you stay in the wardroom of the

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.680
 bridge, don't get down to your spaces. Okay? That's gonna be noticed.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.230
 So the best way to be present is to be present. Go out and walk

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.780
 the decks with your team with your master chief, Chief Petty officer

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.320
 with your leading petty officer. Get out and about because they're

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.870
 also help you one. When you first report to the ship, that's the best

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.420
 thing to do. Walk around with everyone in the chain of command, okay?

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.960
 And see it and try to understand where all your Spence is off. Because

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.510
 again they are all your spaces and so you don't want to miss

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.060
 it space. So the best way to do that is to walk around. Chief Petty

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.610
 officer and petty officer. The officer should see all your spaces A

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.150
 lot. Also. What? They have a point out by doing that? Yeah. When that

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.700
 happened times over the ship that he has to turn over every space.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.250
 The ship. Judy's relief in every space assigned for Catholic. You don't

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.800
 want to be the also that rules space. Oops. You that's going to

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.340
 get you in the hot seat really quick. So the best way to do that is

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.890
 to walk around.
