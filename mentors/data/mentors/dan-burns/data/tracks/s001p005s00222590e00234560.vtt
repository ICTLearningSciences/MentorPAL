00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.980
So with any job with any profession, with any career, there are going

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.110
 to be something. So one of the things up A night it is the long underway

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.240
 tours. So my time I was away for 6 to 8 months. Once I was waiting

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.370
 even longer. My first child, my daughter, was born two weeks before

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:31.500
 my ship got underway for deployment. A little baby girl was born

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.630
 no bigger than my forearm, but her and her mother on a plane to stay

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.770
 with her mother in Pebble Beach, California and I went by deployed

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.900
 for 10 months. So sea duty. It is very hard not only on yourself on

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:56.030
 the family very hard, and that's one of things that you know. It's

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.160
 a It's a negative, but you've got to figure out a way to deal with that.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.290
 And you've got to be very reticent about you know your your your

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.420
 time. There. You've got to be very old bit with your spouse with your

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.550
 family about what it takes to be a naval officer
