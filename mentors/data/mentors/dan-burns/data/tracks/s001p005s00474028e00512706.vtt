00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.660
So where do you think you're gonna be in five or 10 years? Okay, it's

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.480
 a It's an interesting question. What are you as divisional officer?

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.290
 Where you gonna be? His department head. Where you gonna be? His next?

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:24.110
 That's You have to be willing to travel to the job. This is an old

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.920
 saying. If you're ready to travel and the ship major squadron agent

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.740
 job, then detailers will move you to a ship to shore command that

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.550
 needs you. So how do you plan that career? Well, first you do the best

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.370
 that you can in your current job. Try to get the best fit. You can

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.180
 try to get that that no one off ex assigned to the ship's crew and

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.000
 move on to the next ship to the next job that you wanted to. Now you

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.810
 want to. So, for instance, right now, in my time way changed out from

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:10.630
 the P 3 to 8. And there were a lot of pilots that were trying to

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.440
 qualify for the P eight so they would go ahead and get tours that would

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.250
 send them two squadrons with Ph. If you went to a squadron. I didn't

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.070
 have a P eight and you were kind of, you know, telegraphing detail,

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.880
 that you were terminal and you were not going to make a transition.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.700
 Well, this is the thing that it requires you Joo to think about

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.510
 your next career. Where do you want to go on the submarine side? Do

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.330
 you want to stay in? The boomers will just keep on doing boomers,

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.140
 ballistic SSB end the ballistic, missing tours or No, I want to do a

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.960
 fast attack. I walk fast attacks and you want to stay with fast attacks.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.770
 Logical Wheatley. Different mission sets between the boomers and

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.590
 the fast attacks. Whoever stay out and do the ballistic missions

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.400
 in protection of the nation. Fast attacks are out looking a S w looking

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.220
 for other submarines defending the carriers, etcetera, etcetera.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.030
 So it requires 44 on you. What do you want to do with your career?

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.840
 And then one of the things you want to do is while you're on your tour

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.660
 president who are doing a great job, you want to go ahead and find

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.470
 out as much information as you can. All right? Since you want to go

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.290
 ahead and talk to ah Boomer. Skipper, If you're fast that well, you're

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.100
 on a fast cycle. Or if you're on a boat, breathe and talk fast

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.920
 attack and vice versa. So one of the things is when you do come in from

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.730
 being out at sea, there's a tendency to goto four. Go to the four

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.550
 winds. And you know what? You really want to try to go to some of

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.360
 the command functions and try to go and see Talk about Hey, what is

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.180
 that? What is that squadron doing? What is that shit? Do it. Where?

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.990
 What's his? Ever. So that cruiser and that frigates and that, um new

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:41.810
 A L. C s ships coming out you want to find out is, and so they can

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.620
 tell you and shape where you'd like to go with your gut.
