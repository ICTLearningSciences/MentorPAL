00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.220
So my ideal team as a division officer, first aboard the ship, trying

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.580
 to carry out the mission for the Army head. Excellent. Captain. My ideal

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.950
 team is working with my chief petty officer. Seems petty Officer

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:26.310
 in the past, I had actually, on my first ship, I had a Master Ji Petty

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.680
 officer working. Okay? He helped me. Extremely. So it was important

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.040
 to establish a rapport, establish a relationship with Chief Petty

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.410
 officer and carry out a mission in my ambulance. That's I was engineering.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.770
 Also watch. So I had to qualify. So I hasn't used my experience,

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:58.140
 my knowledge, my training to get qualified. As you turn off the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.500
 watch, you walk all the decks of the engineering plant, understand

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.870
 it, casually patrol drills and rely on my chief to make sure that

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:17.230
 I understood how all the technology works. How old personnel fit into

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:23.600
 our division. Our team. So support part is too establishment poor

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.960
 with your cheese later on becomes your divisional officer. After that,

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.330
 you're always has it. It's It's very simple to do that, and it's

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.690
 very howling when and if that goes south, okay, because it was south,

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:49.060
 and you're not gonna have been having everything yourself. Don't do

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.420
 that. Highly recommended that I recommended establishing for you,

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.790
 Chief, you'll have a great yeah.
