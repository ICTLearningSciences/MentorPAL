00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.220
ideal as a division officer first aboard the ship out the mission for

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.580
 the army has excel the captain ideals games is working with my chief

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.950
 petty officer future but it also in the past I had actually almost

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:26.310
 for sure I had a master chief petty officer or and he's out in the street

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.680
 so for me to establish a rapport style with a relationship with

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.040
 the chief petty officer and carry out the mission in white they're

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.410
 going to say it's I was an engineer and also the watch so I had to

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.770
 call for that so I had to use my experience my knowledge for training

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:58.140
 to get qualified as a dinner also watch the wall all the decks of

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.500
 the is very quiet on the stand that you can actually control rules and

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.870
 relied on my chief to make sure that I understood how all the technology

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:17.230
 works and howls personnel fit into our division our T. so also

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:23.600
 for part is to establish or for with your cheese and later on if

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.960
 the computer is also reflected that from here the call as a one off

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.330
 it's it's very simple to do that and it's very hello when and if that

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.690
 goes south it was in the south then you're not gonna be done we rely

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:49.060
 having to do everything yourself don't do that highly recommend that

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.420
 you do that I recommend that you sell shoes for cheap you'll have

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.790
