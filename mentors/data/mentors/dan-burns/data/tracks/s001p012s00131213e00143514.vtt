00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:08.400
one of the ships strategies are dying person for most of the war strategy

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.940
 that is dying out that on arrival is because I say, you know, your

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:23.490
 team, your shift. Everyone's gonna know. Oh, you know, out never

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:31.040
 falls through. I've always is nothing expect what u s So you know this

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:38.580
 this end of the end of all deal with it. You know, I'm just going

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:46.130
 to war. Use up Booth at the same time. There is a time and place for

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:53.670
 that in the Marines and working today. Oh, yeah, that's right. Now,

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:01.220
 uh, no, we're not. We're not sure of that. You shot at. That's not

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:08.770
 gonna flow. So the best thing you could do is understand your mission.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:16.310
 I understand the technology. Understand your capability to fight

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:23.860
 the mission that will know that we hope you get tradition
