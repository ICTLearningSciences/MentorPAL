00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.490
so fatigued work. It does happen. You know, uh, it's they say, that the

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:14.130
 navy runs on coffee. Saw lot smaller, that war to control the nineties

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.770
 on. Personally, I was always a great judge of bad coffee because

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:27.410
 we didn't have a Starbucks on for my shit actual form our ships weeding

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:34.060
 out Starbucks. You could maybe go to a start. But we didn't have

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:40.700
 Starbucks. That stuff on fancy electrolytes and all that good stuff.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.340
 So we'll handle fatigue. Goes back to the old phrase of our many

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.980
 wooden ships. You have to be in shape. You after your coffee, you have

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.620
 to punch yourself whatever it takes, advising anyone to beat the

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:07.260
 crap out of themselves and just sloppy fall. You know, picture on trying,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.900
 stay. Wait. Especially if you're on the bridge and you've got

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:20.540
 a watch. Stay away to get up to get the next watch. Well, believe it

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.190
 because you have 300 souls depending upon you and your judgment. And

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:33.830
 if you want the ship aground to the ship because you're tired loads

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:40.470
 ears, no excuse at all. So drop it. Give me another 20 on I stay

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:47.110
 away The best you can. It's gonna happen. You know your body best, don't

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.750
 you?
