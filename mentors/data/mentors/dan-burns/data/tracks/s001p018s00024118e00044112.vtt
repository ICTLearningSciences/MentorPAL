00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.910
so technological environment in which I worked. It was chief engineer

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:14.960
 on the war years, which waas the first ages cruiser to the fleet. Lot

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:22.020
 one ages One point. We'll say we're on lock 12. So it was pretty high

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.070
 tech at the time over. Actually, I must admit that your system on

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.130
 the road is all right now she is underwater. You got the Davy Jones

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:43.180
 and technology that she was had while high tech at the time it kept

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:50.240
 coming. So what can you do to be better at it is read up on it, be

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:57.290
 available to be attentive Jury. Do not be afraid that calls go. Embrace

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:04.350
 it. Yes, you can. Because when people say love change, no change

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.400
 is change. Okay? Nobody really loves it because they're comfortable

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.460
 with what they just learned. How you're introducing a new baseline.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:25.510
 12.1, just 12. This Lord 11. I just got comfortable with my iPhone

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:32.570
 nine. I was 10 axe. Now there's a left. What was the matter with a

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:39.620
 glass? So the technologies are gonna come and they are gonna change

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:46.680
 your essay. Do is have an open mind to try it, fiddle with it and don't

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.730
 play with it. Try to break it, trying to break it. You're just trying

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:00.790
 to understand how it works. You haven't opened like that.
