00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.400
you know, I was reloading strategies for you to be present with your team.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.940
 You know, the books will have all kinds of recommendations for

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.490
 personally in my time. And I had read a lot way had a lot of leadership

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.030
 examples falls, but I still think the easiest one is VW A management

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.580
 by walking around that shows that your present hey, in your state

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.130
 room, if you stay in, the longer you stay in the wardroom of the

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.670
 bridge, don't get down to your spaces. Okay? That's gonna be noticed.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.220
 So the best way to be present is to be brother, go out and walk the

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.760
 decks with your team with your master chief Petty officer with your

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.310
 leading petty officer. Get out and about because they're also help

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.860
 you one. When you push report to the ship, that's the best thing to

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.400
 do. Walk around with everyone in the chain of command, okay? And see

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.950
 it and try to understand where all your Spence is off because again

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.490
 they are all your spaces and so you don't want to miss it space. So

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.040
 the best way to do that is to walk around with Chief Petty Officer

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.580
 and Petty Officer. The officer should see all your spaces. But also

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.130
 what? They have a point out by doing that? Yeah. When the captain turns

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.680
 over the ship that he has to turn over every space on the ship

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.220
 to his relief and every space just signed for Catholic. You don't want

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.770
 to be the officer that rules space. Oops. You That's going to get

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.310
 you in the hot seat really quick. So the best way to do that is to

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.860
 walk around.
