00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.660
strategies for you to be present with your team you know the the books

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.470
 will have all kinds of recommendations for personally in my time and

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:18.280
 I had read a lot we had a lot of the ship examples the falls but I

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:24.090
 still think the easiest one is M. B. W. way management by walking around

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.900
 that shows that your present if you still hate in your state or

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.710
 if you stay in the log use the the the wardrobe Parisian don't get

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.520
 that'll do you wore spaces okay that's gonna be noticed so the best

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.330
 way to be present used to be Verizon go out and walk the decks with

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:53.140
 your team with your master chief with the chief petty officer would

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.950
 you leading petty officer get out and about because they will also

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.760
 help you were when you first reports the ship that's the best thing

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.570
 to do walk around with everyone in the chain of command okay and see

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.380
 and try to understand where all your senses all this again they all

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.190
 your spaces it's so you don't want to miss a space so the best way

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.000
 to do that is to walk around the chief petty officer and and or the

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.810
 she petty officer had the officer she see all your space also what they'll

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.620
 point out by doing that yeah when the captain Charles over the

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.430
 ship yeah he has to turn over every space off the ship to his relief

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.240
 at every space to sign for that that you don't want to be the officer

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.050
 that rules of space is okay she knew that can get you in the hot

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.860
 seat real quick so the best way to do that is to walk around
