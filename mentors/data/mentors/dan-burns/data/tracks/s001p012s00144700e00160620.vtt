00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.510
for some warning signs of a team that they're gonna be problems ahead

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:12.160
 reporters ahead. Usually, you can spot some of them if the team is not

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.820
 performing its mission. If you can't stand a watch, if the watch

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.480
 is not quiet, okay, you want a quiet watch. You want the box to just

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.140
 turn over and everything happens on time. You switch the boiler's out.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.790
 You switched the gas turbine generators from one often. One. Bravo.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.450
 Yes, you bring on number three gas turbine generator and put number

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:46.110
 one in idle layup. If the team cannot carry that out without significance

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.760
 trying, motivation, consternation, that's a problem. Just

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.420
 standing a watch, which means you need to watch. They understand what

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.080
 a good watch this. Nothing happens so completely in love with the

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.740
 Abbotts happens. That's perfect for a C I. C. Watch officer. Nothing

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.390
 happened. You execute the plan, so that's perfect. Nothing happens
