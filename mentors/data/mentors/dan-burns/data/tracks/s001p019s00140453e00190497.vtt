WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.380
red flagged items in the valve that are easy to miss. So one fill it out

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:13.910
 off for the officers. If you're a degree officer, we're on the pack.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:20.440
 It has about four minutes in the war fighting. Well, if you fill

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:26.980
 one out, okay? And you're sending a message. Many words like with Ward

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.510
 that Well, perhaps not the greatest war fighter. So this is where

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.040
 you have to watch a lot of rocks filled red flags. One walk is missed

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.570
 or not observed. If if the CEO choose. Not observed a lot observes

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.100
 needs to be explained in lock 41 you have little or one. Well, why?

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.630
 Oh, those are because you just rewarded Ward. Two weeks skill and

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:06.160
 the super had a change of command. So we have a chance with period.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:12.690
 Okay, that is okay. You wanna be hates you against all the other officers

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:19.230
 that have been there for half. Okay, He's gonna take their animal.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:25.760
 You so red flags. You have to be careful on that one. Any not

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:32.290
 observed? You know, I had best be explained, and then you know what?

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:38.820
 Anything less than 50 I know that seems a lot you know, But it wasn't.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.350
 You know why? What happened? It's a lot would want is the chance

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.880
 to explain. So another thing to do. You know, seriously, you have to

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.410
 have a day for day accountability off your fit. Well, if you were

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:04.940
 in transit somewhere, uh, if you took a month, just four months of school

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:11.480
 and training in route to your new ship, you better put that on

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.010
 the new chefs, you know? So you see, So the finger of Ward C Day for

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.540
 day, Howard. Huge red flag. If there is a gap in your coverage, you

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:31.070
 know what happened. What do you do for a day? You're off. You cannot

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:37.600
 have. It's got to be explained somewhere. Okay? I was in transit.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.130
 I was at school. I was traveling. All that needs to be explained in

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.660
 the block for one. Okay. And you know, if the award what a thing to

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:57.200
 do, you leave a command and you've been nominated for a meritorious

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.730
 service medal. You've been nominated for the League of America, but

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:10.260
 it hasn't been received yet, But you gotta go to your next command.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.790
 Well, make sure that it says on the ship that you're leaving nominated

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:23.320
 for Meritorious service medal. And then when you get to your new

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.850
 command, it is awarded Meritorious Service Medal for performance. On

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:36.380
 my last command, it's got to be explained leaving and the last thing

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.910
 I would say about awards. No words dicey but awards. Everyone is

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:49.450
 expected to have a going away metal or war messages when you don't have

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.980
 a war. That's the message that the old man says to the board saying

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:02.510
 Not worth it Now the fact that everyone has an award, how do you

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:09.040
 break that? That means you have to somehow break out during your tour

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:15.570
 and get your war. So if you could admit to award and an inventory

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:22.100
 ward, Oh whoa, that you I do walk on water Elevated three feet. Ball

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:28.630
 deserves. So it's a tricky I think about awards. Your master it, you'll

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:35.160
 get good, wish you well with it. It's not a pretty system. Was

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:41.700
 the system that we have, and I think it's more honest than what this

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:48.230
 06 has observed from the Air Force in the Army. You said it in the

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:54.760
 Army. Maybe there is other perspectives altogether, and it's going

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:01.290
 maybe
