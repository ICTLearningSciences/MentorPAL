00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.820
So it's wise, uh, living on base or off. Ace? Um, that depends on housing

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.800
 nobility. Of course, since you did the waters that you're going

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.770
 to a new base that you can apply that day, uh, two living two houses.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.750
 So soon as you get your orders, you need to apply for housing. I would

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.730
 definitely recommend you do that because you don't have to take

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.700
 housing. But if you wait and don't apply if we're all just looked out

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.670
 on the economy, it wasn't a good idea. We'll know you had a good

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.650
 now your boss to find it on the list. So definitely a sushi. Get waters

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:54.620
 to area. Get yourself on the housing list. You take it. Oh, it's

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.600
 a good, good starting point just in case.
