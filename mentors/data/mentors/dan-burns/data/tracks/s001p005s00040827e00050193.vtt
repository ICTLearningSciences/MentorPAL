00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.810
a typical day for May out, it seems to be getting up. Morning breakfast,

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.770
 probably going to morning quarters, getting the word of the day for

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:18.740
 you have a mission. I would then have a watch to stand in the engineering

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.700
 spaces or toss. I'll bridge our combat information center,

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.660
 standing watch four hours or so, and then going down and doing my administrative

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.620
 work and walking around my space is, uh, lunch role of

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.590
 dinner and then have another watch. I stand the watch and then of, but

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.550
 mainly the day was two watches and two watches and be off before

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.510
