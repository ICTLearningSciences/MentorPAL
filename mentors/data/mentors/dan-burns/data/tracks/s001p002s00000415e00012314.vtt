00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.490
I am Navy Captain Dan Burns, graduates of the Naval Academy in 1984. I

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:12.130
 am a surface warfare officer Ship driver served on two ships out of

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.780
 the Pacific L P D and screw. It's out of hand. I went to the U. S.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.420
 Naval discredited school in Monterey, and after that, served on my department

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.060
 tours. Chief engineer on a fast forget out of Charleston and

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.700
 on the actual USS Ticonderoga out of normal, deployed on both of

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.340
 those tours with the USS Teddy Roosevelt, Natalie's on both ships and

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.990
 then went ashore to the awesome military affairs at Central Intelligence

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:51.630
 Agency. While there, I screamed for XO of Aegis cruisers and

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:57.270
 command of a small ship. But frankly, at that point my second child

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.910
 had been born and I decided to resign my active duty commission and

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.560
 joined the reserves. I finished out my 30 year career in the reserves.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.200
 I was recalled once during that time for a total of 18 years of active

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.840
 duty, 12 years and reserves, and I retired in July off 2014
