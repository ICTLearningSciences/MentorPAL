00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.980
for some warning signs of a team that they're gonna be problems ahead

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.110
 reporters ahead. Usually, you can spot some of them if the team is not

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.240
 performing its mission. If you can't stand a watch, if the watch

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.360
 is not quiet, okay, you want a quiet watch. You want the box to just

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.490
 turn over and everything happens on time. You switch the boiler's out.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.620
 You switched the gas turbine generators from one often. One. Bravo.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.750
 Yes, you bring on number three gas turbine generator and put number

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.880
 one in idle layup. If the team cannot carry that out without significance

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.010
 trying, motivation, consternation, that's a problem. Just

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.130
 standing a watch, which means you need to watch. They understand what

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:08.260
 a good watch this Nothing happens. So complain enough inhabits happens.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.390
 That's perfect for a C I. C. Watch officer. Nothing happened.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.520
 You execute the plan, so that's perfect. Nothing happens
