00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.750
So we're going reporting seniors that are registered to give feedback

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.660
 to you. You the junior boss, in this case, you're the junior all sir,

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.560
 and you're carrying out daily mission. And you're getting crickets

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.460
 from chain of command. Okay, well, one thing, uh, quick, it's He's

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.360
 usually a sign of your You're okay? Because people will lay down like

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.270
 a ton of bricks on personnel and team members that are not performing.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.170
 So in this case, you know, you're hearing nothing. Well, is that

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.070
 bad or good? First off, you might want to sit down. You're going to

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.970
 have formal get togethers either at quarters a, a daily sit down with

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.880
 the XO. Planning for for training to be a t. You know, they'll be

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.780
 official times meetings you could just or lunch. You know, one of

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.680
 the meals. You can have a cup of coffee. Say so. I just wanna make sure

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.590
 we're okay. You know this direction? I'm going in. I have heard

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.490
 nothing back, so I'm gonna continue on course and speed told directs

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.390
 otherwise, and I don't believe heading into the rocks. That's always

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.290
 one way to do it. It's not necessarily a bad sign if you're not getting

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:41.200
 feedback, it's just in this day and age. Frankly, everyone's busy.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.100
 So you're not broke. I'm not gonna fix you. And therefore, I'm

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.000
 not created Feedback, Uh, for the most part, especially that broke.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.900
 So I don't have to fix you things that have broke before fixing in a

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.810
 bar, feet back. That's always the gays. But I'm saying you can operate

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.710
 that, but you might want to check.
