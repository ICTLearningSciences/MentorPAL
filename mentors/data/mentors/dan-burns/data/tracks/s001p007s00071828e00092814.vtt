00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.680
reporter seniors that in our are reticent to give feedback to use also

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.520
 this case road you're all Sir and you're carrying out the daily mission

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:21.350
 and they're getting hurt it's from but yeah yeah well one thing

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:28.190
 crickets is usually a sign of here we are okay because people lay like

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:35.020
 a ton of bricks all personnel team members that are not performing

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:41.860
 so in this case you know nothing well is that bad or good first off

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:48.690
 you might want to sit down you're going to have that whole get togethers

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.530
 either at morning quarters the a a daily that would be a for

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.360
 for training maybe if the yeah they'll be official five meetings and

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:09.200
 you can just for lunch you know one of the meals you can call is a

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:16.030
 all right sure OK you know this is the direction I'm going in I have

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.870
 heard nothing back so I'm gonna continue of course and speed told

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:29.700
 Iraqis are wise it I don't believe heading into the rock that's one

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.540
 way to do it if it's not necessarily a bad sign if you're not getting

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.370
 feedback it's just in this day and age frankly everyone's busy so

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:50.210
 I'm not gonna fix yeah and therefore if you back for the most part description

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:57.040
 of the world so I don't have the fiction things that are

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.880
 more require fixing a bar feedback let's say that's always the case

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.710
 but also a operate that but you might want to check
