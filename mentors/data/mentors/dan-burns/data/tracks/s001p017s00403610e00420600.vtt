00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.770
How often will you have to move in your career? So my classmate from Naval

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.680
 Academy, four balls from Brooklyn they've created lived actually

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:21.600
 on 84th Street in Brooklyn, and up until we were department heads,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.510
 Dave had moved twice. I didn't move 11 times that that Now Dave is

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:35.430
 vice admiral, deputy for Stratcom. He said. The move a couple of times

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.340
 now or since since we've been in the Army heads together. Um, the

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:49.260
 Navy is trying to do homesteading and homesteading is good for the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.170
 whole. There's no stigma attached to hold steady. It's here if you get

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:03.090
 it. But first and foremost, it's needs off the Navy. Most of the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.000
 needs not always gonna be in the whole four year old means in the Navy.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.920
 Just that which applies. I wouldn't be where they need you. That's

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.830
 you go with any jet. They kind of go yet you know your next duty

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:30.750
 station afterwards, so you hope about details should help you out
