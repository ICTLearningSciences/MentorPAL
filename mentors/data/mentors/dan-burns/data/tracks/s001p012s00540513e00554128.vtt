00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.860
travel paid for system. You are becoming familiar with DTs defense travels.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:12.870
 Irv's is on. It's an overrated system. They pay for your tickets.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.880
 You want you get old, you need to go somewhere. You d'oh. You going

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.890
 well into DTs. You plan your trip, then the contacts also supply

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.900
 officer will get you a travel about your number that gets applied and

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.910
 they booked travel. And you also have your government travel card

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.920
 because he'll be issued that you haven't already been issued and then

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.930
 they could book the ticket. You execute the travel and then at the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.930
 end, you come back and you file a travel. He your receipts, anything

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.940
 over 25 bucks. Although I'm told that has changed. I kept everything

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.950
 every received over $25. Now you just file it, Fill that out. Um,

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.960
 we used to have travel clerks that fill all this out for you. I think

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.970
 the case anymore, you have to become your own expert travel, filling

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.980
 out those things probably the hardest part of travel. We'll have

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.990
 to travel. Make sure that you get all your expenses. That phone struggles

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.000
 for job
