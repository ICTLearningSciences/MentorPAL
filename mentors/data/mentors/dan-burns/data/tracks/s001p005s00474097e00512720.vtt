00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.650
So where do you think you're gonna be in five or 10 years? Okay, it's

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:12.450
 a It's an interesting question. What are you as divisional officer?

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.250
 Where you gonna be? His department head. Where you gonna be? His next?

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:24.050
 That's You have to be willing to travel to the job. This is an old

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.850
 saying. If you're ready to travel and the ship major squadron, agent

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.650
 job, major, then detailers will move you to a ship to shore command

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.460
 that needs you. So how do you plan that career? First, you do the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.260
 best that you can in your current job. Try to get the best fit. You

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.060
 can try to get that that no one off ex assigned to the ship's crew

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.860
 and move on to the next ship to the next job that you wanted to. Now

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.660
 you want to. So, for instance, right now, in my time way changed out

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:10.460
 from the P 3 to 8. And there were a lot of pilots that were trying

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.260
 to qualify for the P eight so they would go ahead and get tours that

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.060
 would send them two squadrons with Ph. If you went to a squadron that

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.860
 didn't have a P eight and you were kind of, you know, telegraphing

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.660
 detail, that you were terminal and you were not going to make a transition.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.460
 Well, this is the thing that it requires you Joo to think

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.260
 about your next career. Where do you want to go on the submarine side?

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.060
 Do you want to stay in? The boomers will just keep on doing boomers.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.870
 Ballistic? Yes, est bien the ballistic missile tours or no, I want

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.670
 to do a fast attack. I walk fast attacks, and we want to stay with

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.470
 fast attacks. Those are completely different mission sets between

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.270
 the boomers and the fast attacks. Whoever stay out and do the ballistic

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.070
 missions and protection of the nation. Fast attacks are out looking

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.870
 A S w looking for other submarines defending the carriers, etcetera,

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.670
 etcetera. So it requires 44 on you. What do you want to do with

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.470
 your career? And then one of the things you want to do is while you're

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.270
 on your tour president who are doing a great job, you want to go

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:49.070
 ahead and find out as much information as you can. All right? Since

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.870
 you want to go ahead and talkto a goober. Skipper, If you're fast

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.670
 that you're on a fast attack or if you're on a jewelry, then talk fast

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.470
 attack and vice versa. So one of the things is when you do come in

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.280
 from being out at sea. Hey, there's a tendency to goto four. Go to

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.080
 the four winds. And you know what? You really want to try to go to

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.880
 some of the command functions and try to go and see. Talk about Hey,

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.680
 what is that? What is that squadron doing? What is that shit? Do it.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.480
 Where? What? What is that? And that frigates And that, Um do A L.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.280
 C. S ships coming out. You want to find out as much so they can tell

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.080
 you and shape where you'd like to go with you.
