00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.330
so what is critical to review when you start a new two or on your show

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.810
 that when you walk up the brow it gets you new ship one thing that

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:17.290
 the commanding officer always at this is the standing orders yeah and

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.770
 before you're gonna be qualified as an officer that import or the

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.260
 also the deck under where the tactical action officer what age and also

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.740
 watch you're going to have to know the commanding officers standing

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.220
 orders this is vitally important because these are his one on one

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.700
 directions to you until you call me if this happens yeah the most

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.180
 the easiest thing but one thing demanding officer to the bridge yeah

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.660
 trust me reading officer will get to the bridge real quick when that

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.140
 war goes out over the one MC Hey because he knows and he will trust

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.620
 you if you have if you the Les Paul in the commanding also the bridge

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.110
 that's what happens in the game okay gotten trouble reading officer

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.590
 did not get to the bridge so the commanding officers standing order

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.070
 number one thing that you need to worry in fact if you're going

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.550
 to a new ship you might want to ask the exact you know can I get a copy

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.030
 of the committee also standing orders before you even get their

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.510
 day that shows that you're being aggressive you're leaning forward in

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.990
 the saddle and you want to see a standing orders now of the in addition

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.470
 to that each night under way all the commanding officers night

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.960
 waters and the night workers are equally important it lays down step

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.440
 by step okay when to call the captain for any situation okay if there's

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.920
 a contact bearing down on you what's known as C. BDR constant

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.400
 bearing decreasing rate you've got some unidentified contact coming

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.880
 down straight at you captain wants to know every commanding officer

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.360
 once said that when that situation happens there's a few other situations

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.840
 and they were gonna be refilling tomorrow morning so on the night

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.320
 watch we've got a figure out all the hoses on the port side and

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.810
 make sure that we're ready to receive lines in my ears you know probably

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.290
 at dark thirty in the morning the standing orders will waive those

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.770
 out so those are two things that you can be for familiarize yourself

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.250
 with the you and make you a better off you're going to have you

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.730
