00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.330
So what is critical to review when you start a new tour on your ship,

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.810
 when you walk up the brow and get you a new ship, one thing that the

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:17.290
 commanding officer always has is his standing orders. And before you're

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.770
 gonna be qualified as an officer, that import or the also the deck

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.260
 underway or the tactical action officer you lost the watch, you're

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.740
 going tohave to know the commanding officers standing orders. This

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.220
 is vitally important because these are his one on one directions to

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.700
 you to tell you. Call me if this happens. Okay? Most easiest thing.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.180
 One thing is commanding officer to the bridge. Okay, Trust made commanding

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.660
 officer will get to the bridge. Really? When that war goes

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.140
 out over the sea? Because he knows. And he will trust you if you have.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.620
 If you delay calling the commanding Austin the bridge, that's what

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.110
 happens in the McCain. McCain got in trouble. Manning officer did

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.590
 not get to the bridge. So commanding officers standing orders number

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.070
 one thing that you need to read. In fact, if you're going to a new

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.550
 ship, you might want to ask the exact, you know, can I get a copy off

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.030
 the commanding officer standing orders before you even get there.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.510
 Hey, that shows that you're being aggressive. You're leaning forward

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.990
 in the saddle and you want to see his standing orders. Now, in addition

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.470
 to that, each night underway are the commanding officer's night

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.960
 orders on the night waters are equally important. It lays down step

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.440
 by step. Okay. When to call the captain for any situation. Okay, if

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.920
 there's a contact bearing down on you, what's known as CVD are constant

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.400
 bearing. Decreasing range. You've got some unidentified contact

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.880
 coming down straight at you. Captain wants to know every commanding

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.360
 officer wants to know. When that situation happens. There's a few other

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.840
 situations in there. Hey, we're gonna be refueling tomorrow morning.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.320
 So on the night watch, we've got a fake out all the hoses on the

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.810
 port side and make sure that we're ready to receive lines and liners,

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.290
 you know, probably at oh, dark 30 in the morning and the standing

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.770
 orders will lay those out. So those two things that you could be

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.250
 from familiarize yourself with that pair you and make you a better also

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.730
 going to get a new command
