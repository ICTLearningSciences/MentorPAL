00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.220
So my ideal team as a division. Also first aboard the ship, trying to

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.580
 carry out the mission for the Army head. Excellent, Captain. My ideal

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.950
 team is working with my chief petty officer. Seems petty Officer in

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:26.310
 the past, I had actually, on my first ship, I had a master chief Petty

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.680
 officer working, and he helped me extremely. So it was important

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.040
 to establish a rapport, establish a relationship with Chief Petty

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.410
 officer and carry out a mission in my ambulance. That's I was engineering.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.770
 Also watch. So I had to qualify. So I hasn't used my experience,

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:58.140
 my knowledge, my training to get qualified as off the watch, all

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.500
 decks, all the engineering plant, understand it casually control drills

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.870
 and rely on my chief to make sure that I understood how all the

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:17.230
 technology works and how old personnel fit into our division. Our teeth.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:23.600
 So what's important part is to establish a rapport with your cheese

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.960
 and later on it becomes your divisional officer. After that, you're

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.330
 always has it. It's It's very simple to do that, and it's very

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.690
 when and if that goes south, okay, because it was south and you're

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:49.060
 not gonna have it down to having everything yourself. Don't do that.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.420
 Highly recommended that I recommended establishing for you, Chief.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.790
 You'll have a great yeah.
