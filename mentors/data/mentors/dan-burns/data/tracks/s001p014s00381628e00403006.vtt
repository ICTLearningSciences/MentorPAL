00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.540
d'oh assignment. That is not a good fit. So you know, you've got each

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:14.230
 command is roughly two years. We've got 10 to years commands. If you're

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:20.920
 gonna deal with 20 years, that time you're gonna after Mads that

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:27.610
 you're gonna like and have a talk myself. A 30 year career. By that

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:34.290
 logic, I had 15 commands. So roughly at 17 commands told from fuck

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.980
 the beginning and off 17. There's only three of 17 that I would say

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.670
 I would not go back to. I would not go back to that work. I did. I hope

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.360
 you have a lovely like that you're joining. But when you're enduring

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.050
 those 3 17 are not comfortable, not fun, if you will. Was drawn

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.740
 the Navy to see the world Have a great war. Have some fun along the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.430
 way. Or are you doing frankly? What are you doing? One thing your labor

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.120
 is if it's a personnel conflict, you or the other person is going

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:27.810
 to roll. Thank you. Your throat. I don't want anyone to stand off

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.500
 for two years. Frankly, if they're out of cycle means just a year before

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.180
 that person or persons changed out, so best thing to do at that

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.870
 point is Brendan Barrett. That apple tour Because you don't want to

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.560
 be labeled as the problem, child. Couldn't get it done. So do your

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.250
 tour serve the nation? Remember, I This is one of my flight 17. Well,

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.940
 okay, that's okay. You do that because the other 14 gonna be passed.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:14.630
 That's a pretty good bad marriage.
