00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.200
my time is a junior. Also, how I lead by example was multiple ways, but

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.560
 I sure believe getting out standing watches We had long underway watches

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:19.910
 68 hours at a shop, going down and tracing the system's understanding

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.270
 with men. Women are doing on the watch in the engineering holes,

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:32.620
 and I would walk the deck a lot of times I would just walk Dex,

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:38.970
 see what the mission Waas. What is the messenger of the watch? Go

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:45.330
 call down to a woman should go down to after steering. Don't slough

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:51.680
 it off. What? Someone else? Do it. Pick up the wash law and go stand

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.030
 the watch. Go and stand the death. It's easy. A lot of times just go

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.390
 back to your stable and call it a night. Or you could take one more

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.740
 hour. Get down to engineering room, walked Dex. Um, department had

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.100
 No, no. This is, for example, of division officers. But as department

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.450
 head, as chief engineer, I was able one time walk down, and I found

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.800
 out that, you know, one of my head the officers had been working

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.160
 on trying to solve auxiliary problem. For about three hours. He was

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:42.510
 down there all by himself. So I spent another two hours with, So that

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.870
 meant he was there for five hours total. Why was two hours, five hours?

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:55.220
 I fried. We finally got it right. Got it figured out. We got three

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.570
 settles and putting out, uh, expected. How's that? It was supposed

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.930
 to deliver. It was a matter of getting the old right caskets over

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:14.280
 a place mat 0.1 of the master chief's that was on coming watch comes

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.640
 down. Finds out chief engineer just spent two hours in four day gang

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.990
 room. You know, he was not the best tree was like the fact that

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:33.340
 I have done a very much admired if I was very upset that the chief engineer

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.700
 was wandering around the space is high school, But I don't love

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.050
 that. Ben. Chief engineer took out time topside. He had been in

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.400
 the log where he could have been elsewhere doing things, but I took

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.760
 time out. I always take a time out to see what your engineers doing

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.110
 See with the boasting nature to take time to walk around, uh, management

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.470
 by walking out and be w. That will get you a lot off traction with

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.820
 your division
