00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.070
Okay, so what kind of sailors pose problems? Um, you know, if if there

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:13.290
 was a magic, you know, class glasses that you put on C be great, make

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.510
 a lot of money saw that there isn't necessarily so can identify,

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.730
 or you're gonna find him. One of things about that is you want to be

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.950
 careful with your time This time is the one thing we have very little

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:38.170
 off if you wind up trying to spend 90% of your time on 10% of your

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.390
 problem Children, Okay. What about the other 90% that are so this

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.620
 is the balance that you're going to have to come up with as a leader.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.840
 Treat everyone fairly goes about saying, treat them fairly. But if

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.060
 the troublemakers are out there, um, just now I'm not saying ignore

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:09.280
 them. But be careful about the rest of the unit arrested with division,

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.500
 because if you wind up spending 90% of the time for the one percenters,

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.720
 you're going to lose the rest of tradition. So that's a hard

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.940
 thing to work at balance, but it will pay off
