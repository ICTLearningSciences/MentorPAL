sellers because problems okay this is if if there was a magic you know

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:13.290
 glass classes as you would on C. B. gory make a lot of money so but

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.510
 there isn't necessarily someone yeah you're gonna find them there were

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.730
 things about that is you want to be careful with your time this

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.950
 time is the one thing that you have very little of both the if you want

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:38.170

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.060
 what if the troublemakers were out there just the LSA ignore them but

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:09.280
 be careful about the rest of the unit the rest of the division because

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.500
 if you wind up spending on for the one percent or you're going

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.720
 to use the restroom so it's a hard thing to work at balance what will

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.940
 pay off
