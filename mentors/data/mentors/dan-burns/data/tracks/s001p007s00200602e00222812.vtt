00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.620
when I was a Navy. Different from the other branch of the military. It's

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.380
 the day's sail. They John Paul Jones. One thing about the Navy is

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:21.150
 way our self reliance. You even bigger realize the other way and sell

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.920
 old Arising. You are part of that crew are of that ship very independent,

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.680
 and it forces you to be hush wars. What I found was much more

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.450
 self reliant. Then the Army or the Air Force officers got leads are

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:48.220
 part of the date. You said that, but frankly, the Air Force they

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:54.980
 returned to own base. Okay, B to B 52 outstanding at Pratt and they

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.750
 fly home. Everything okay? I'm out there in the middle of Pacific and

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:08.520
 I won't be home for a couple of months. So I had to make sure that

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.280
 I am relying on this. If they get a mission failure, it's gonna turn

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.050
 around. Go home. The army. The army is reliant when they're out of

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:28.820
 garrison. If they're out of garrison and there he didn't find out War.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.580
 Okay, but how money. And yes, we've been fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:42.350
 for 18 years now, but for the most part, that Special operations

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:49.120
 right now. That's not a big arm being. Always missions allowed

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.880
 or 23 up, etcetera. There's a strong one. Deploy on my ass. Okay,

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.650
 take out the enemy and returning to Paris. Okay, Navy goes out, spreads

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:09.420
 diplomacy. Lets the world know this is what America is all about.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:16.180
 And everyone wants to come to America. Still the number one destination

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.950
 for the planet.
