00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.920
my relationship with the personnel in my division departments on aboard

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.990
 my ships I was more of a you want to see near far I was more arms

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.060
 reach. You will always be, You know, Mr or Mrs Ensign, Lieutenant Commander,

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.130
 you're always going to be looked at as the khaki. Um, you're

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.200
 not with the illicit grew. And that applies even if you're a Mustang,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.270
 you know, you used to be in the chief's mess. You're not in the

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.340
 business anymore. You're in the wardroom. And that implies, you know,

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.410

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.620
 You don't want to be seen as a machine or a robot like that. But

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.690

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.760
 are in the professional arms way. Our men, women, how about arms?

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.830
 And there's going to be a time when you may be called upon to go in

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.900
 harm's way. And that is part of the good water invisible. You must be

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.970
 ready to execute the mission. We are combat men of arms
