00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.370
go to some French slang items in the valve that are easy to this. So one

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.900
 fill it out. Offer for the officers. If you're a degree all, sir,

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:20.420
 we're on the packet as about form. It's in the war fighting. Well,

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.950
 if you felt that one out, okay. And you're sending a message. Words

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:33.470
 lives with Ward that Well, perhaps not the greatest war fighter. So

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:40.000
 this is where you have to watch a lot of rocks filled out. The red flag

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.520
 is one block is missed or not observed. If if the CEO choose, Not

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:53.050
 observed. Uh, a we're not observes. Needs to be explained in lock

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:59.570
 41. You have a little one. Why? Uh oh, Those are because you just rewarded

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:06.100
 award you with skill. And the super had a change of command.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.620
 So we have a chance with her. Okay, that is okay. You wanna be hate

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:19.140
 against all the other officers that have been there for half. Okay,

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.670
 He's gonna take care of you. So, red flags. You have to be careful on

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:32.190
 that one. Any not observed? You know, I had best be explained, and

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:38.720
 then you know what? Anything less than 50 I know that seems a lot,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.240
 you know, But you know why? What happened? It's what you want is the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.770
 chance to explain So another thing to do. You know, seriously, you

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.290
 have tohave day for day accountability off your fit. Well, if you were

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.820
 in transit somewhere, if you took a month, just four months of school

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:11.340
 and training in route to your new ship, you better put that on

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.870
 the new ships, you know, so you can see So the finger up ward C day

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.390
 for day, Howard. Huge red flag. If there is a gap in your coverage,

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.910
 you know what happened. What do you do for a day? You're off. You can

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.440
 have a day off. It's got to be explained somewhere. Okay? I was in

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.960
 transit. I was at school. I was traveling. All that needs to be explained

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:50.490
 in the block. Okay? And you know, if the award what a thing to

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:57.010
 do if you leave a command and you've been nominated for a meritorious

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.540
 service medal. You've been nominated for the League of America.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:10.060
 Okay, but it hasn't been received yet, but you gotta go to your next

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.590
 demand. Well, make sure that it says on the ship that you're leaving

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:23.110
 nominated for meritorious service medal. And then when you get to

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:29.640
 your new command, it is awarded meritorious service Medal for performance.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.160
 On my last minute, it's got to be explained leaving. And the

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.690
 last thing I would say about awards. No awards. Look, I see what awards

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:49.210
 everyone is expected to have a going away metal or award messages

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:55.730
 when you don't have a war. That's the message that the old man says

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:02.260
 to the board saying You're not worth it now the fact that everyone

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.780
 has an award. Okay, so how do you break that? That means you have to

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:15.310
 somehow break out during your tour and get your war. So you admit

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:21.830
 to award and an inventory ward. Oh, whoa. That you I do walk on water.

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:28.360
 Elevated three feet of all deserves. Okay, so it's had a tricky I

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.880
 think about awards. Your master it you'll get good. Wish you well with

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:41.410
 it. Pretty system. What is the system that we have? And I think

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:47.930
 it's more honest than what this 06 has observed from the Air Force in

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:54.460
 the Army. You said it in the army, Maybe difference other perspectives

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:00.980
 all together, and it's going to be
