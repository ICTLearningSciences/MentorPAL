00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.850
so complete my training o D. Under way. It's going to vary because you

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:14.850
 have to be on your way and it depends where you hit the ship and its

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:21.850
 ashore and see cycle patient. So if you report to a ship in the shipyard,

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:28.840
 that's you. Awhile you report to the ship while she's on deployment.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.840
 That's great. Personally, I met my ship on the deployment.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.840
 I was able to qualify for Yau in 81 days. And then there was just not

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.840
 enough time to go topside and qualified. So then we went to the shore

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.840
 rotation and we were 44 year before we deployed again. I qualified

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.840
 for my also south. I'm assuming this is Austin that underway. Also,

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.840
 that underway requires a year A good, solid year off Underway time

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.830
 doing all the evolutions. Okay, that means, you know, anchoring. That

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.830
 means unwraps, refuelings, etcetera, etcetera mo board, etcetera.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.830
 Personal transfers. So 30 year qualifies. Also that import two weeks,

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:38.830
 two weeks
