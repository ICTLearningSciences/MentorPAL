00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.850
my train for all the other way it's going to be very because you have

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:14.850
 to weigh and it depends where you get the ship and it's you know short

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:21.850
 and see cycle HM so if you reporter ship in this regard this is the

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:28.840
 old while the reports of the ship well she's on the point that separate

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.840
 personally I met my ship on the point that I was able to qualify

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.840
 for easy our is eighty one days and then there was just not enough

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.840
 time to go topside a qualified so then we went to the short duration

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.840
 and we were there for four years before we deployed again and then

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.840
 I qualified for but also so I'm assuming this is all state that on

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.840
 your way also that on your way far as a year a good solid year of

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.830
 under way five doing the evolution okay that means you know anchoring

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.830
 that means alright refuelings etcetera etcetera mon more etcetera

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.830
 personal treasures so this year it is also that imports two weeks two

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:38.830
 weeks
