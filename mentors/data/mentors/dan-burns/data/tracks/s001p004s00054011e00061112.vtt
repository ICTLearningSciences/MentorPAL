I am a retired Navy captain. At this point, I've had 18 years of active

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:13.250
 duty, followed by 12 years in the reserves and for a combined total

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.460
 of 30 years service to our country and at 30 years, naval officers

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.660
 most retired. With the exception, I will say there is one exception.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.860
 Admirals can remain on active duty past 30 years.
