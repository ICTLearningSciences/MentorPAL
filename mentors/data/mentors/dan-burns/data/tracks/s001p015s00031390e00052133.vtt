00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.220
it was one to recover from a professional bumping. So you try to be defecting.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.590
 We try very hard. That means you're gonna make the states.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.960
 So the first thing is used to seeing top going. Remember? What will

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:26.340
 you do? You gotta get back in the saddle. You got to get back up. You

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.710
 gotta try it yet. You were going to be doing her ship's officers.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:39.080
 You're going to be doing bullshit alongside station keeping. Do not

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:45.450
 hit the other ship. What was her shoot? Times that way have available.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.820
 Did that especially was underway? Joys. So you've got to rehearse

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.190
 it in your mother. You've gotta find time to go up on the bridge, Wayne,

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.560
 or on the flying Bridge. Look down and watch this. Watch someone

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:10.940
 do the evolution so you could have it fresh in your mind when your

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:17.310
 turn comes to do a kind of exercise. So this thing when you do have

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.680
 a bump in the road a acknowledge it for training will evaluate the

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.050
 situation. Do not fight it, not fight that you went last one you shouldn't

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.420
 want, right? Just acknowledge that you did, for whatever reason,

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.790
 and corrected the next time corrected in train. Your engineer gotta

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:49.170
 do qualify as an engineer. Awesome. Watch. Just do another engineering

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.540
 drill. Get pounded in here at making part of also. Okay, this

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.910
 will have to do to get it. That means acknowledging estate getting

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:08.280
 up doing it again.
