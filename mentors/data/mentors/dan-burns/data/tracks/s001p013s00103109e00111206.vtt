You know, sometimes you are gonna take a chance in the Navy and try to

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.560
 figure out one way or something, and then it's gonna go south because

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.410
 South Jay Command is responsible because it happened on their watch

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.260
 as well as you watch. But the first foremost take responsibility

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.110
 for it. It's so simple. I lost the aircraft. Okay? I had to pull. I

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.970
 had to reject. Okay. All right, we'll figure it out. They'll get the

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.820
