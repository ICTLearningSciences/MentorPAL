00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.780
onboard naval ships and submarines. Also, the commanding officer is at

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:12.700
 the top of the organizational command. Below him is an executive officer.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.630
 Well, the executive officer are multiple department heads. One

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.550
 of the department heads is a chief engineer. The chief engineer is

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.480
 responsible for all propulsion, heating, light water. So everything

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.400
 that it takes make a ship or suffering go fool. Because maybe ships

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.330
 we go forward. Navy ships, navy aircraft, they go for we fight forward,

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:48.260
 not designed to go in reverse, decide to go forward into the line

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.180
 of battle. So, as a chief engineer, my responsibility I had 150 men

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.110
 assigned to bay on the USS Ticonderoga. Had an operational annual

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.030
 operational budget of about 30 million. And all told on the equipment,

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.960
 um, infrastructure, if you will. I'd say that ship was worth that.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.880
 I was responsible for about $750 million. So that's what we do. Is

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.810
 the chief engineer is keep the ship running in on, uh, locally. We

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.730
 I would say I was a person. The guy responsible for getting the ship

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:35.660
 from point A to point B. That's what I did on board the ship.
