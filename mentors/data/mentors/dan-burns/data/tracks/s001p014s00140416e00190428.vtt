00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.370
What's a marriage like? Items in the valve that are easy to this. So one

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.900
 fill it out. Offer for the officers if you're a degree. Also, we're

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:20.420
 on the packet as about form. It's in the war Fighting. Well, if you

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.950
 fill that one out, okay. And you're sending a message. Words lives

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:33.470
 with Ward that Well, perhaps not the greatest war fighter. So this

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:40.000
 is where you have to watch A little blocks filled out. The red flag

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.520
 is one block is missed or not observed. If if the CEO choose. Not observed

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:53.050
 alone, not observes. Needs to be explained in lock 41. You have

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:59.570
 a little one. Why? Uh oh, I observe, because you just rewarded award

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:06.100
 to skill. And the super had a change of command. So we have a chance

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.620
 with her. Okay, that is okay. You wanna hate against all the other

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:19.140
 officers that have been there for half? Okay, He's gonna take care

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.670
 of you. So, red flags. You have to be careful on that one. Any not

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:32.190
 observed, you know, just be like, and then you know what? Anything

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:38.720
 less than 50 I know that seems a lot, you know, But you know why?

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.240
 What happened? It's a lot more we want is the chance to explain. So

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.770
 another thing to do. You know, seriously, you have tohave day for day

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.290
 accountability off your fit. Well, if you were in trains it somewhere.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.820
 If you took a month, just four months of school training in route

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:11.340
 to your new ship, you better put that on the new ships, you know,

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.870
 so you can see So the figure of Ward C Day for day coverage huge red

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.390
 flag. If there is a gap in your coverage, you know what happened.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.910
 What do you do for a day? You're off. You can have a day off. It's got

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.440
 to be explained somewhere. Okay? I was in transit. I was at school.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.960
 I was traveling. All that needs to be explained in the block. Okay?

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:50.490
 And you know, if the award one thing to do if you leave a command

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:57.010
 and you've been nominated for a meritorious service medal, you've been

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.540
 nominated for the lead. Okay, but it hasn't been received yet, but

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:10.060
 you gotta go to your next demand. Well, make sure that it says on

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.590
 the ship that you're leaving. Nominated for Meritorious Service medal.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:23.110
 And then when you get to your new command, it is a well regarded,

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:29.640
 meritorious service medal for performance. On my last minute, it's

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.160
 got to be explained leaving. And the last thing I would say about awards,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.690
 no words. Look, I see, um, but awards everyone is expected to

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:49.210
 have a going away metal or award messages when you don't have a war.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:55.730
 That's the message that the old man says to the board saying, You're

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:02.260
 not worth it now The fact that everyone has in a war but this How

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.780
 do you break that? That means you have to somehow break out during

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:15.310
 your tour and get your war. So you admit to award and an inventory ward.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:21.830
 Oh well, that you I do walk off water elevated three feet of all

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:28.360
 deserves. Okay, so it's tricky. I think about awards. Your master

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.880
 it, you'll do good. I wish you well with it. It's a pretty system. Was

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:41.410
 the system that we have, and I think it's more honest than what this

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:47.930
 06 has observed from the Air Force in the Army. You said it in the

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:54.460
 army, maybe difference other perspectives all together, and it's

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:00.980
 going to be
