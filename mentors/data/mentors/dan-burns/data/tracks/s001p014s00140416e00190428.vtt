00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.520
why items in the valve that are easy to miss so one fill out off of the

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:14.190
 we also if you're a military officer in the river up around the back

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.860
 it asks about form it's in the war five well if you fill out all

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:27.530
 of our okay then you're sending a message with a revival of war that

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:34.200
 well perhaps not the greatest war five so this is where you have to

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.870
 watch all the blocks to how the red flag is one o'clock is miss or

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:47.540
 not observe if if the zero is used for a lot of that are all the observers

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:54.210
 need to be this way in walked forty one if you have a lot of

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.880
 all over one well why observer because you've just reward for few weeks

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:07.550
 ago and the server had a change of command so we have a chance with

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:14.220
 us okay okay that is okay at that point because you don't wanna

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.880
 be right as all the other officers that have been there for half a day

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.550
 and he has a better than you or at the size of the so red flags you

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:34.220
 have to be careful on that one any knowledge or you know that's the

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.890
 way and then you know walk anything less than a five oh I know this

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.560
 is all a lot you know but it also you know why what happens is that

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.230
 what what what is the best of all right so another thing to do you

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:00.900
 know if you're really you have to have a war a eligibility of your

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:07.570
 favourite well if you were in transit so if you think a month is foremost

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:14.240
 a sweet and training in route to your new ship you better put

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.910
 that on the new ships you know so you can see war is C. day for day

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:27.580
 our huge right flag yeah there is a gap in your coverage it was after

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:34.250
 the well for a day you can have a day off it's got to be slaves of

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.920
 war okay I was in transit I was at school I was traveling okay all

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.590
 that needs to be explained in the walk for one okay and you know if

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:54.260
 you work one other thing to do if you leave a comment and you've been

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.930
 nominated for a meritorious service medal we've been nominated for

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.600
 the lead okay but it hasn't been received yet what you got to go to

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:14.270
 your next mail well make sure that it says on the ship that you're

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:20.940
 leaving nominated for meritorious service medal and then when you get

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:27.610
 your new command it is also a meritorious service medal for performance

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:34.280
 on my last man it's it's got to be one eight leaving them and

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.950
 are always there to save our wards no words that's what I see border

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.610
 wars everyone is expected to have a going away a battle or war messages

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:54.280
 when you don't have the war that the message that the old man

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.950
 says to the poor saying it's not worth it yeah the fact that everyone

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:07.620
 has a war okay so how do you break out that means you have to somehow

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:14.290
 worked out during your more for for war so if you could mentor ward

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:20.960
 and then the door work all well the you you walk on water elevated

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:27.630
 three vehicles or and so it's kind of tricky thing about awards no

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:34.300
 master if you'll give good she well with it are pretty system what

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:40.970
 is the system that we have and I think it's more honest than what this

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:47.640
 six SO zero from the airforce norm does things that we already had

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:54.310
 it maybe there is other perspectives all together that yeah and it's

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:00.980
 maybe the all
