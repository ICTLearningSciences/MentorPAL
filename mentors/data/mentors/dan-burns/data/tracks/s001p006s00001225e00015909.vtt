00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.130
socialize outside of work so interest you you do want to socialize with

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:13.420
 your wardrobe of I've always found that because you are one ship won

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.700
 T. one one zero so my father's record recollections from five thirty

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.990
 years for all of the four ships one zero and we would go up we have

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:32.270
 a large party back in the day and also we would we were under way

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.560
 it affords we would all the pretty much would the wardroom you you're

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.840
 really tight with your wardrobe now there would be official ships

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.130
 functions where you know the division with our party we we would have

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:57.410
 division Christmas parties on the on the bigger ships you you'd

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.700
 have multiple parties there or the department to get together so I decided

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.980
 to I will say one one thing a one really likes having to go to

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:16.270
 a party being directed to go to a party so if I was the senior officer

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.550
 at the parties would arrive first arrive on time schedule phone

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.840
 but also the first and what the crew party so it's it's about them

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.120
 you know you never want to be seen for all the work for you during the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.410
 day you know let them have their time off and it's so that's a that's

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:47.690
 a delicate balance that you have to form
