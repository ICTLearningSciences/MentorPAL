00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.130
I socialize outside of work. That's interesting. You do want to socialize

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:13.420
 with your wardrobe. I've always found that because you are one ship,

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.700
 one team won't wardroom my father's record Recollections by 30

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.990
 year tour are the four ships work rooms and we would go up. We had a

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:32.270
 lot of parties back in the day, and also we would, uh, underway in

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.560
 a port way would want a much with the warder. You're really tight with

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.840
 your wardrobe. Now. There would be official ship's functions where

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.130
 you know, the division, that party, we would have to give you Christmas

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:57.410
 parties on the bigger ships. You have multiple parties, there

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.700
 are departments would get together. So I've done that, too. I will say

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.980
 11 thing. No one really likes having to go to a party of being directed

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:16.270
 to go party. Um, so if I was the senior officer at the parties,

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.550
 I would arrive first, arrive on time scheduled time, but I'd also

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.840
 be first and but the crew party. So it's about them. You never want

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.120
 to be seen with dictatorial. They work for you during the day, you

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.410
 know, let them have their time off. And so that's a delicate balance

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:47.690
 that you have to find
