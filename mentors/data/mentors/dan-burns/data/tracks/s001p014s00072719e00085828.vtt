The biggest risk I've taken in my career was to go be chief engineer aboard

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:16.030
 USS. All right, lady, you engineers were fired for failing light

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:23.620
 off exam. Three engineers turned down the job. I was the fourth guy.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:31.210
 I was hit by my also waas chief of staff. The fleet that actual

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:38.800
 reason on type out a rover broke. It needed to be fixed on that wasa

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:46.390
 very gutsy call to go do that. Uh, basically, she she was broken and

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:53.990
 she needed a lot of help. I was able to go there. Thank you, dear.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:01:01.580
 It was in a year we passed our light off exam. We asked our tea or

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:09.170
 coffee off about Lee Ha Lee Burke trophy time with only one ship off

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:16.760
 class one ship, his body will get it. That trough I've got so satisfied

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:24.350
 with that that was quite the rest go. I could have said no. I just

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:31.940
 want to execute my orders. Maybe needed me to go toe to toe
