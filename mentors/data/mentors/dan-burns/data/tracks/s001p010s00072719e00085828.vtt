The biggest risk I've taken in my career was to go be chief engineer aboard

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:14.860
 USS. All right, lady, you engineers were fired for failing light

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:21.870
 off exam. Three engineers turned down the job. I was the fourth guy.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:28.880
 I was hit by my also Waas, chief of staff. The fleet, that actual

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.880
 reason and the taipan arose broke. It needed to be fixed on that wasa

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.890
 very gutsy call to go do that. Uh, basically she she was broken

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:49.900
 on. She needs a lot of help. I was able to go there. Thank you, dear.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:56.910
 It was in a year we passed our light off exam way past our tea or

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.910
 coffee off about lead. Holy book trophy time with only one ship off

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:10.920
 to class one ship, his body will get it. Sure. That 12 5 Very satisfied

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.930
 with that. That was quite the rest go. I could have said no. I just

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.930
 want to execute my orders. What is it? Maybe needed me to go out
