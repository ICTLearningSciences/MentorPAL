00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.750
So I would like to say that way are in Not in a zero defect. Maybe right

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.650
 now. So I'm not sure that that is the case. I don't think that's

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.560
 ever been the case. Not as accepting of failures. Um, So to avoid that,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.460
 you have to do as many drills as many runs. Rumors practice around

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.360
 this dry run scenario planning etcetera that you could possibly think

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.260
 of. This is where the aviators have over us where they could do

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.160
 the simulators. Just fly the simulator, fly the simulator, fly the

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.070
 simulator. I have been told that the pilots that flew the J 35 simulators

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.970
 ball vast and got, you know, absolute a number one scores for

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.870
 then at the least, crashes off the aircraft when they were finally giving.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.770
 So run your drills. One you're acting in a decade. Be part of

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.680
 that personally. As ah, Chief imaginary officer, I was always the number

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.580
 one nozzle man going to the fire. I always wanted to know how

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.480
 hot it got in those fires and great legs. That's where we went in my

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.380
 time for firefighting training. You wanna know one of your body, Teddy,

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.280
 when you have to go put out a fire. So what do that is by doing?

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.190
 So do thrills Try to figure out what you can do that will help you

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.090
 be prepared for those zeros effect mentalities that you're gonna be

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.990
 facing.
