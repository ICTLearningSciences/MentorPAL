Okay, Work with someone. Spots someone assess a model who is willing to

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:15.370
 change versus those that will not change. Learned that by conducting

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:22.620
 your day in, day out watches You know your mission of your ship submarine.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:29.880
 Only gonna figure that out, interacting with people in your

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:37.140

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:44.400
 that, you know, they grew up on the analog. Now, also, you want to

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:51.650

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:06.170

 change is change, Some people change and there are others. Everyone

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:27.940
 deals with change. Do that understand your mission. Walking with Dex

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:35.200
 Walking watchers say, Hey, by the way, we're bringing in a new riverboat

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.460
 next month. That riverboat is nothing like the old partners that

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:49.710
 we had. It has new engine for people that are trained on that. So

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.970
 it's up to you. You didn't do it, and I was awful for the mission
