when the ops tempo increases. First, foremost get the word out to your

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.920
 team. To division should stop. Would where we wanted to get the word

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.450
 out because no one wants You need a pair of people, so they could

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.990
 be ready to ramp up to it. And there are going to be okay. We're going

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.520
 to be doing unwrapped tomorrow morning, followed by a refueling.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:34.060
 Okay, there we go. All right, The plane. Our house. Okay, that's high

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.590
 up step over that day. I sure hope it's a Saturday, so I could take

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.130
 off on some day. You have a light duty day on Sunday, but you can't

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.660
 tell on some days at sea being a day off. Hopefully, there are some

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.200
 times, hopefully something you cooked up, you could wind up spending

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.730
 Sunday afternoon in the Bering Sea. And they always over on the bridge,

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.270
 which based not taking off on Sunday. You try to make sure that

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.800
 the ship, um it's red and obstinate. Bo doesn't change this ship.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.340
 Appreciator machinery. Yeah, off. Simple high up. Simple puts that

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.870
 effect on you as a divisional. Sir, you have to make sure that that

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.410
 machinery doesn't quit. Betty come off line. Do you do for maintenance

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.940
 and bring it back up on four? All right, and then just run off step.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.480
 Oh, effects hops person, and you're gonna go through periods of

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.010
 it. But first of all, the way to be ready for is to get down and then

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.550
 excuse me with a smile. No one likes it. That's a huge commission.
