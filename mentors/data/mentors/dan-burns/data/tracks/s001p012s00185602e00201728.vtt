00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.650
How do you handle people that cannot meet their standards? You know, uh,

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:12.460
 it is a pyramid structure, our baby. If the nice thing about that

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.260
 is, all the standards are laid out so annually at the same time, if

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.070
 the person was told, choose knocked out a lot of the peak US requirements

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.870
 for advancing to rate and take the second fast exam and fell

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:35.680
 to do that. Well, I don't have to recommend you for second class, and

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.480
 they'll be winding about that. But frankly, one thing that you have

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.280
 to watch out for is is if you do have a freeloader out there and freeloaders

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.090
 make a lot of noise and a lot of bravado. Gravitas. Okay,

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.890
 Usually that means someone else is picking up the spot or that person.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.700
 You have to weed that out with your chief petty officer ordered

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.500
 officer and figure out who's really standing watch. And you've got to

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.310
 take care of the people that are living up to their arrows, going

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.110
 okay, You've got to try to take care of those people
