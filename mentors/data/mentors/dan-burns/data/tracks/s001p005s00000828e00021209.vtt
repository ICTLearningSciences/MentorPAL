00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.730
the first major leadership gold. Upon graduating from the Naval Academy,

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:14.610
 I attended division officer school in car Narrow California. And

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.480
 from there I went to my first ship, Mrs Ogden, out of Wall Beach for

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.360
 you. That four is now goes down. But at the time in the eighties, I

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:35.240
 was very busy Port and I actually flew to Philippines. So meet my ship.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:42.120
 I was assigned at Engineering Army as a main machinery officer.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.990
 And so I spent the next 90 days deployed on the ship wall. Fine as

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:55.870
 it insuring all surgical watch. No. Isn't Yao and then leading? I had

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.750
 a department signs. I'm sorry. Division assigned to me off roughly

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:09.630
 80 men Way were a single sex ship. That one warrant merged elephant.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.510
 Now, it was just the way that that ship was filled out and fitted

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:23.380
 out with personnel. Um and so I had the crew on my machine. Is Bates

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:30.260
 assigned between two different famous sherry planning a one namer.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:37.140
 She replied, over too. So a lot of time down there, qualifying. And

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:44.020
 and then we were, as I said, deployed so from his oh, beans and civic.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.890
 I went, uh, with the ship award and got to go to Singapore, Hong

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:57.770
 Kong, Korea, Hawaii and back to Long Beach, so a lot of steaming during

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:04.650
 that first seat as an engineering officer.
