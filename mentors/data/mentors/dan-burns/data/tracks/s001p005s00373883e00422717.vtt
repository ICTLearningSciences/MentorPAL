00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.980
s So how did my work day change over the life of my career? Um, I will

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.120
 say that as a divisional officer at sea at sea duty, um, my day entailed

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:19.250
 a lot of running around and inspecting, making sure equipment

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.390
 worked a lot of spot checks. Um, coming back as a department head. The

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.520
 one thing that was that was different was, you know, now people are

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.660
 looking at you. So now all of a sudden is not 25. 30. There's, ah,

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.790
 150 people that are looking to you for the answer. A za chief engineer.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.930
 You know, there's only two times when I had hard casualties, where

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.060
 where the ship waas suffering from a major catastrophic casualty.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:02.200
 And we were on the verge off what is known as being going cold and

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:08.330
 dark. And so at that point, when the cash Lee was called away and

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.470
 I had to get my transport myself, you know, very fast, very quickly.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.600
 Down to the central control station CCs. Everyone's looking around,

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.740
 and at that point, it knows why everyone's looking at you. You're the

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.870
 man now that is different from being a divisional officer. That was

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:39.010
 the one time when all eyes go to you and it's your train, your war

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:45.140
 sense, your knowledge or experience that you have to rely on is no

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.280
 one else but that voice. So that's the thing about sea duty. There's

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.410
 always as things are gonna change. Time's gonna change between division

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:03.550
 officer, the former head. But as a department head, you need to

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.680
 use your experience from your division. Also yours. What is it like?

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:15.820
 How is it gonna play out, Um, and then on on shore duty? Um, I personally

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.950
 as unsure of it in my first short tour, you know, I was a student,

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:28.090
 so that wasn't too taxing at the Naval Postgraduate School.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.220
 I just had to push myself, too. Get my A's, you know, and push on through

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.360
 and learn as much as I could. Um, for instance, because the degree

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.490
 I had was National Security Affairs stepped on television. Well,

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:52.630
 that qualified me later on for my second and final active duty short

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.760
 tour. And that was at the hospital to your affairs at Central Intelligence

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.900
 Agency. And so I had to rely on my knowledge game, uh, from

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:11.030
 years before at a post graduate school and on my operational experience,

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.170
 learn how to, uh, act, you know how to translate what the fleet

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.300
 is doing and how to use a fleet at the also military affairs at the

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.440
 Pentagon with C I A. So you're doing doing Maur cerebral work, If

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.570
 you will, when you get to the higher ranks and you're trying to figure

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:41.710
 out, you know, when you're at it at a combatant command, you know

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:47.840
 what exactly we want to do with the missile force, what exactly we're

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.980
 going to do with the submarine force? Why are we going to deploy

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:00.110
 a ballistic submarine to the specifics right now? So what are the Indians

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:06.250
 and the Pakistanis? Perhaps we don't need a submarine in the

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:12.380
 Pacific. Perhaps we needed in the Indian Ocean. That's the kind of thing

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.520
 that you do as a senior officer is. Make these recommendations.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:24.650
 What is the art of the possible? You want to advise the civilians that

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:30.790
 air advising the National Command Authority in C. A. And that's

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:36.920
 what you're counting on? That's what you are being taught to do to be

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:43.060
 in the right position at the right time, with the right knowledge

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:49.190
 to advise national command authority on what
