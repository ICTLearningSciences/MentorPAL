00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.470
How many hours a week did I work? Um, there's a difference, of course,

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.090
 Between working at sea on ah, see tour and working ashore on a short

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:20.710
 for, um at sea. You're basically working 24 7365 You're working every

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:27.330
 day. How many day? How many hours a day are up and doing your job.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.950
 Rebel Lee is at, uh 0 600 and taps in the evening is a 22 100. And

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:40.570
 in between 06 and 22 you run around a lot doing your child job nation,

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:47.190
 and it's very satisfying doing at Show on Shorty a little bit.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.810
 Not as rigorous, not as long on our it can be depending upon what the

00:00:53.810 --> 00:01:00.430
 nation is doing at the time and what your job is. Shorter's, um readily

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:07.050
 stills. 0 600 And every day at 0 800 is colors. So from 08 to

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:13.670
 1700 5 p.m. In the afternoon on shore duty, I was usually knock off

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.290
 for short. That was that was good to go. Go home and start over again.
