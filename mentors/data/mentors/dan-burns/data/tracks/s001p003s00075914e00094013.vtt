WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.170
so if you have a conflict in the first few days of the unit is that all

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.480
 of the other maybe remember that there there are two different fleets

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.800
 lance would be the Pacific Fleet so is it normal not particularly

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.110
 but could there be differences most definitely there are differences

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.430
 and when you go from one squadron two with all this water when you

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.740
 go from the training school to the actual the points water yeah this

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:38.060
 is gonna be a little bit of a difference day and that's were use

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.370
 officer junior or senior or mid grade officer you're just gonna get

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.690
 acclimated and that first couple of days and understand so one of these

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.000
 is that I would most of what it is okay when you have something

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.320
 to say well we didn't do it on our last ship that way that's true but

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.630
 you're not on your lashes your honor you should so you've got to adjust

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.950
 to the new ship and that's the thing expect the change expect

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.260
 there to be differences you've got the skills to go ahead and perform

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.580
 so remember for the most part all ships go all planes go for we'll

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.890
 go for so you might be tempted to think I didn't do that on my life

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.210
 ship you know only a lecture are you sure and that's the way you're

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.520
 gonna perform on a new ship gold for on the jury protect the nation

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.840
 and the mission
