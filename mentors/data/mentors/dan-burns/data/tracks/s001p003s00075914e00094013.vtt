WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.170
So if you're having a conflict in the first few days of the unit, is that

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.480
 normal? Maybe remember that there are two different fleets. Fleet

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.800
 on the Pacific Fleet. So is it normal? Not particularly. But could

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.110
 there be differences? Most definitely. There are differences. And when

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.430
 you go from one squadron to another swatter, when you go from the

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.740
 training school to the actual deployed water, yeah, there's gonna

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:38.060
 be a little bit of a difference. And that's where using officer, junior

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.370
 or senior grade officer, You're just going to get acclimated in

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.690
 that first couple of days and understand. So one of these is that I

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.000
 would most definitely advise. Okay, when you attempted to say, Well,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.320
 we didn't do it on our last ship That way, that's true. But you're

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.630
 not on your ship. You're on. So you've got to adjust to your ship, and

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.950
 that's the thing I expect. Change. Expect there to be differences.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.260
 You've got the skills to go ahead and perform. So remember, for the

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.580
 most part, all ships go all planes go. We'll go for so you might be

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.890
 tempted. Do you think I didn't do that on my last ship? You know your

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.210
 last ship, You don't do shit. And that's the way you're gonna perform

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.520
 on your new ship. Going forward on the journey protected a nation

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.840
 on the mission.
