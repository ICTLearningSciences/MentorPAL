What warning signs should you not try to solve Forward? Okay. This date

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:15.130
 age right now are the best team leader. You're the best person in

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:22.270
 charge to be aware off team members. Oh, with t. So, when I was a captain,

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:29.400
 uh, they were riding school. A lot of suicides at that point,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.540
 maybe wide, but it's all I want you to be aware off your team what

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.680
 they do. Okay, A little sudden, you know, they're acting strange. One

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.820
 of a fruit of the chain of command. If you have a question about anyone's

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.960
 mental health, there they are. Okay. Divorces. Sadly, they haven't

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.100
 okay, but a divorce all of a sudden, that effects effects person's

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.230
 mental health. That's the same way. So most are more bad, sister

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:19.370
 brother alone. A sudden mental health aspect to that point. Why don't

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:26.510
 let the exit of the bomber had the Excelsior 40 change. No way

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:33.650
 to get a chaplain over. Asked questions You do not want to land on person.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:40.790
 Team member on. Then they're not gonna feel secure is gonna be

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.930
 even worse, you know, Say, hey, Jones. Seaman Jones. I'm a cup of

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:55.070
 coffee with chapel, right? Don't talk. So that's a lot of his name's

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:02.200
 coffee. Coffee is probably a better way to do it, and you'll get personally,

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:09.340
 I've only had I've had one suicide in one of my ships, my

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:16.480
 four ships and I've had three deaths. Watch a live person. Um, take

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.620
 care of our cells. Have to be aware of your people.
