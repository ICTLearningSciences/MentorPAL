What things are there for you to do on a ship while a river ships on Cold

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.960
 War ships for a reason? You're served the country. So one of the

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:23.510
 things is not there. Sure, sure. And serve the country mission. You're

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:31.070
 awesome. What's every shitty has some pipe off Jim or some pipe

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:38.620
 off recreational activities on dhe. And he's a smart phones being. The

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:46.180
 reason you get a degree, that's a lot of fun. You know, you're not

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:53.730
 gonna have that much time off between watches. You're standing a watch

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:01.290
 and then won your division running your department. Same understanding

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:08.840
 watches. So there's very little three time. Wash your underwear

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:16.400
 in Fort on the same thing in Port Hole. Hanley war from our head

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.950
 or whatever. If you're home and you cause trouble
