00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.150
how I handle self doubt. Um, yeah. There's gonna be times in your career.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:13.450
 You gonna wonder why am I out here? Why am I doing this job? I'll

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.750
 tell you a lot of nights. And if I were wearing my uniform right now

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:26.060
 Bourbons on you. See, I have see service deployed with four pins

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.360
 on it. Four Oakley's on it, which stands for two years. Fully deployed

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.660
 away from the country with my family, with my cold underway at sea,

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.960
 Another year in hand. So technically, I was away for three years

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.260
 from the States. Anyway, the thing is nice. Worshipped robbery at night.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.560
 You look up at the stars, you can see the stars, and you know what

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:03.870
 you're doing. You know your mission. I always like to look back

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.170
 for the ship from sugars on the way and you have shifted colors from

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.470
 the fantail to the main mast. Ship is underway. You see old glory flying.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.770
 It's flying because you're there, nor mission on. What you're

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.070
 doing is keeping that flag showing that flag that's always been inspired.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.370
 Um, I was advised officers will have a chance in Washington D

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:41.680
 c by and see all the monuments goodbye and looking. Lincoln worked

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.980
 with the Washington Monument. Look at what they did. Is that smart?

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:54.280
 Okay, they did a lot, so they knew what they did. I think I try to stay

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.580
 motivated to do.
