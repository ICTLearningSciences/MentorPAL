00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.310
You know, you've got a tough mission coming up for inspection. Coming

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:13.760
 up, getting ready for deployment. You're getting ready for obvious.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:20.220
 You're getting ready for ref trade. You get ready to go out and do the

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.670
 mission. It's how do you help the team get ready for that? The one

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.130
 be present. Do hot slough off. You know, the weekend before Monday,

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:39.580
 inspections be around, wall your decks. Tell you one for example.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:46.040
 Not so funny at the time. I did as a captain. As a captain, I walked

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.490
 Dex. I had a radiological inspection coming up. I walked through my

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:58.950
 entire building. Everything's good to go. Everything's labeled. Did

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:05.400
 I know that the contractors were coming in to eat the whole pits that

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.860
 weekend? No. No, I did not. What happens? Removed All exterior site

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:18.310
 Ege interests. Image from all bulkheads, all doors. So Monday morning

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.770
 for the radiological inspection. But I just went and seed on Friday

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.220
 with my own eyeballs Automatic because we don't have the radiological

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.680
 inspections rooms designated because the contractors took the

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.130
 scientist. Yeah, way fault with that. That would be more so. You know,

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.590
 as a captain, you keep warning. You expect what you inspect. Should

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:57.040
 I've got in on Sunday afternoon? Well, yeah, I could have done that.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.500
 We fix things that we ultimately repaired and have a great expections.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.950
 Yes. Okay, But if you are not present, if you do not walk the

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.410
 spaces, you are at risk, okay? And it's better to walk the spaces

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.860
 with your teeth. The personnel that are going to be showing off the

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.320
 spaces so as a dry run and you will have a dry run for inspection. Stash

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.770
 crew, team member. So what you gonna tell the inspector? He shows

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:42.230
 up. You're just asking a question. You want to know when? That way

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.680
 that will allow you to evaluate your team members knowledge, experience,

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.140
 training level. And is your she ready for the inspections?
