 so you want for example lots of only at the time I did as a as a captain

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.770
 I walked the decks I had a radiological inspection following up

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:54.480
 and walk through my entire building everything is good to go everything's

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.180
 label yeah did I know that the contractors were coming in two

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.880

 exterior signage interest signage follow the rules so Monday morning

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:21.290
 for the radiological inspection she also went in seat on Friday with

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:28.000
 my own eyes I felt because we don't have the radiological inspections

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.700
 rooms designated because the contractors to decide that yeah which

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.400
 folders that that would be more okay so you're the captain to keep

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.110
 warning that you expect when you inspect **** I've got it on Sunday

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.810
 afternoon well yeah I could have done that do we fix things that

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.510
 we ultimately repaired and have a great expansion yeah yeah but if

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:08.220
 you are not pleasant if you do not walk with spaces you are at risk

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.920
 okay and it's better to walk the spaces with your TV the personnel that

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.620
 are going to be showing off the spaces so the dry run and you will

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:28.330
 have a driver one for inspection as we can remember so what do you

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:35.030
 tell inspectors on who shows up that you're just asking a question

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.730
 you wanna know way with that will allow you to evaluate the team members

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.440
 knowledge experience training level and is she ready for the inspections

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:55.140
