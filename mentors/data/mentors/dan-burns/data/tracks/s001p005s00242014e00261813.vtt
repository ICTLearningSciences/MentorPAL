00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.570
So how much fat will do I do in a year? This this again would be broken

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.290
 up into. You know, when you're on a ship, you're not. You're underway

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.010
 with the ship and the ship travels. U percent don't travel too much

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.730
 when you're in ship's company on ship's company because you're traveling

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.450
 with trip. Now the ship get underway and go in the Western

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.170
 Pacific, where you go into the Mediterranean and you see all these ports.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.890
 And that's a lot of great fun and a lot of great travel on it's

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.610
 still goes back to John Paul Jones and joined the Navy and see the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.330
 world lives a lot of fun, a lot of travel. Are you traveling with your

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.050
 with your ship? Um, when you ensure duty, that could be different.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.770
 That could be depending about where you go for your shore duty. Um,

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.490
 it could be a little more. There could be a lot of travel. Um, on

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.200
 one of my short tours, I was at the Naval Postgraduate School. I really

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.920
 didn't travel too much there. I did travel twice to do work associated

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.640
 with my thesis, so I had a thesis research. I travel a little

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.360
 bit. Thio Washington and to the Midwest for two sores, Um, for my

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.080
 other tour short tour. I was assigned to the Office of Military Affairs

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.800
 at the Central Television, and I did a lot of exercises. Well, these

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.520
 were worldwide global exercises, so, frankly, a lot of lot of travel

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.240
 there. So if you're looking forward to a lot of trouble when your

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.960
 shorty you want to look for an exercise shop, get you around and

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.680
 you'll get to go to a lot of conferences. A lot of exercise is a lot

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.400
 of travel, so it can be had. You can do a lot of travel or you can

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.120
 not do a lot of trouble. Depends on your choices that it depends on

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.840
 how you execute those choices.
