00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.250
So what encourages accountability? Um, number one say, you know, fiduciary

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:13.660
 responsibilities. Easy. If you signed for it, you are responsible

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:20.060
 for you become the wardroom mess. Treasurer, you are as possible

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.460
 for the news you become the more the officer responsible for casting

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.860
 all those little 20 votes. If you sign for something, okay, fun. That's

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:39.270
 gonna be your responsibility. I could tell you when I was, so do

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.670
 the engineering school graduate school in Monterey. They were one

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:52.070
 of the department's. The physics department was running a coffeehouse

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.470
 out of the mess because there's no coffee at that campus at that time

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.880
 and no one has permission. No one knew about it. Suddenly they were

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:11.280
 $300 in the hole. Require is attention. So way had to encourage

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.680
 a little bit more accountability. At that point on, dhe lay down the

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.080
 wall and this band that best okay, because they couldn't come up with

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.490
 it. Um, so it's artist accountability. That's that is fiduciary responsibility,

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.890
 accountability for the mission for the team. If you're

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.290
 the ace W officer, we're going out on the range in two months to fire

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.690
 a live warhead. Okay. Thang will better know how we're gonna do

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:56.100
 that. What? All the fire? Because we want to come back with a broom

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.500
 attached to the mast way. Don't wanna be known as the ship that couldn't

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.900
 shoot straight because you get to look up fire procedures or didn't

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:15.300
 understand how the total Ray was supposed to respond. You met firing

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.710
 criteria because you isolated summers and you didn't tell it.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:28.110
 Eoe foreign bacteria is met. Weapon away. Get away!
