00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.110
I socialize outside of work. That's interesting. You do want to socialize

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:13.380
 with your wardrobe. I've always found that because you are one ship,

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.640
 one team won't wardroom my father's record recollections. My 30

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.900
 year tour are the four ships, and we won't go up. We had a lot of parties

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.160
 back in the day, and also we would underway in a port way would

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.430
 on a pretty much with the warder, You're really tight with your wardrobe

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.690
 Now. There would be official ship's functions where you know

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.950
 the division that party way would have division Christmas parties on

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:57.220
 the bigger ships. You have multiple parties. There are departments

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:03.480
 get together. So I don't know, too. I will say 11 thing. No one really

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.740
 likes having to go to a party of being elected to go to a party.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.010
 So if I was the senior officer at the parties, I would arrive first,

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:22.270
 arrive on time scheduled time. But I'd also be first and what the

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.530
 crew party. So it's about that you never want to be seen with dictatorial.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.790
 They work for you during the day, you know, let them have their

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:41.060
 time off, and so that's a delicate balance that you have to farm
