00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.730
How can you lead on? Um, that a way to put that is how could you not leave

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:12.610
 honorably? One thing the capital right now is very divisive. That's

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.500
 the capital. It's not you. It's your ship. Such as water. Such

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.380
 your submarine you need to lead. Honorable. You need to lead your men

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.260
 and women that are assigned to your command. You will. It's easy.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.140
 There's an old adage about get up each morning. You look at the guy

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.030
 in the glass guy or the gal in the glass yourself in the mirror, you

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.910
 say, What can I do better this day? Okay. I act on our integrity. That

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.790
 will get you through your day. Yes. Well, tribulations. There'll

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.670
 be trials. We'll get through the day. Okay? You take short cuts with

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.560
 your honor and integrity. They will catch up to you. Sooner or later,

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.440
 they will catch up. Don't be tempted. Don't go to the dark side.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.320
 Stay in the light. Stay with an act with your honor. Integrity
