00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.360
Yeah. You're reporting to see you're something. You're Katie Command.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.870
 But that's how you really should be with the people in charge of you.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.380
 So how should your relationship being with change your reporting,

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.890
 seniors? Fact that that is important. Because day in, day out, you're

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.400
 gonna see that. You see, with 40 quarters, you're gonna see a meal

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.910
 hours in the wardroom. You can see at the colors that this same standing

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.420
 watch, you see general quarters. So you have to have a professional

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.930
 yourself. It has to be a professional relationship with a good

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.440
 relationship with her. But you can come in and say So you talked to

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.950
 you? I have a situation that I have not experienced. And can I get

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.460
 some thoughts you want to be able? You'll know that you have a good

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.970
 relationship with your reporting seen here. When it gets to that time.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.480
 Were you understand? You can lock on the door. I could ask you a

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.990
 question. You won't be going in there all the time and wasting time.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.500
 No senior officer is gonna say you're wasting time. They want you to

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.010
 be yourself for life yourself for lying to the point where you could

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.520
 finally go knock on the door. Say, have you experienced this? I'm

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.030
 just trying. Just watch your advice to look at that.
