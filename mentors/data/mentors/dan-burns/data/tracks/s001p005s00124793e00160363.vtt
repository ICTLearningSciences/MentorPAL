00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.440
So the decisions that I made on a daily basis at seize on my four different

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.030
 ships, you know, pertains to what was the vision of the ship.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.620
 So, for instance, I had to make sure that as an engineering officer,

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:23.220
 A ll both engines online, ready to go. And if we didn't have the engineering

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.810
 parts, I had three gas turbines that provided all the electrical

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.400
 power for their ships along the lights. All the power for the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.990
 computer. Well, if one of the equipment if one of the generators went

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:45.580
 down now I'm in a casualty response mode and my decisions would revolve

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:51.170
 around what it would take to keep that generator that electrical

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.760
 load. Morning. You would think that's, you know, an easy decision.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.360
 But it, Zelig, when you're driving your car, you've got to go from

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.950
 Washington D c down to, uh, go for you have no dance in your car.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.540
 Can you get the car from point A to point B? Same thing with the ship.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.130
 You have to know. What is it gonna take to keep that ship running?

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.720
 Well, in this case, you don't have a gas station. So the decisions

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.310
 that I have to make every day are to make sure that I am so sustained.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.900
 And I have enough equipment. Resource is personnel to keep that

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.500
 ship warning. Shipshape. So speak on time. Um, And on your way under

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.090
 budget, Because again, departments divisions, you all have budgets

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.680
 that you have to maintain. So do we have enough fuel tomorrow? And I'm

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.270
 gonna be taking on fuel from the Shasta. Okay. What is that gonna

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.860
 take? That means I need to make sure that my fueling alignment to receive

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.450
 fuel. That was a personal thing, That responsibility for the

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.040
 chief engineer. I had to personally verify Valvoline so that when we

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.640
 took fuel from another ship keep us under way, doing our mission for

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.230
 the nation. That was my personal responsibility. My job was to make

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.820
 sure that every one of those valves was a line. And I had a dedicated

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.410
 checklist to do that. So there's no one. Where is my checklist decision

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.000
 over to Can I get and see every one of those valves inspect?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.590
 Expect when you inspect. So I have to run around and that it's things

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.180
 like that. A deadly evolution doesn't sound like much, but when you're

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.780
 the person responsible for taking on fuel to make sure that we

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.370
 don't spill any fuel when we're taking on fuel, that's a very you know,

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.960
 that's a very heavy responsibility and requires a lot of fought

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.550
 on medication, and you've got to do it.
