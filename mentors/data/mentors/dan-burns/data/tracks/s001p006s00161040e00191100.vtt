00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.320
So what is critical to review when you start a new tour on your ship,

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.800
 when you walk up the brow and gets you a new ship, one thing that the

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.270
 commanding officer always has is this standing orders. And before

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.740
 you're gonna be qualified as an officer, that import or the officer

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.210
 of the deck underway or the tactical action off, Sir, you lost the watch.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.690
 You're going tohave to know the commanding officers standing orders.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.160
 This is vitally important because these are his one on one directions

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.630
 to you to tell you. Call me if this happens. Okay? Most easiest

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.100
 thing. One thing is commanding officer to the bridge. Okay, Trust

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.580
 made commanding officer will get to the bridge Real point when that

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:01.050
 war goes out. Because he knows. And he will trust you if you have.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.520
 If you delay calling the commanding Austin the bridge, that's what

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.000
 happens in the McCain McCain. I got in trouble. Manning Officer did

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.470
 not get to the bridge. So commanding officers standing orders number

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.940
 one thing that you need to read. In fact, if you're going to a new

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.410
 ship, you might want to ask the exact, you know, can I get a copy off

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.890
 the commanding officer standing orders before you even get there.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.360
 Okay, that shows that you're being aggressive. You're leaning forward

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.830
 in the saddle and you want to see his standing orders. Now, in addition

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.300
 to that, each night underway our commanding officers night orders

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.780
 on the night quarters are equally important. It lays down step

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.250
 by step. Okay. When to call the captain for any situation. Okay, if

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.720
 there's a contact bearing down on you, what's known as CVD are constant

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.200
 bearing. Decreasing range. You've got some unidentified contact

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.670
 coming down straight at you. Captain wants to know every commanding

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.140
 officer wants to know. When that situation happens, There's a few other

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.610
 situations in Hey, we're gonna be refueling tomorrow morning. So

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.090
 on the night watch, we've got a fake out all the hoses on the port

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.560
 side and make sure that we're ready to receive lines and line years,

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.030
 you know, probably at oh, dark 30 in the morning. And the standing

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.500
 orders will lay those out. So those two things that you could be from

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.980
 familiarize yourself with that pair you and make you a better officer

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.450
 going to a new command
