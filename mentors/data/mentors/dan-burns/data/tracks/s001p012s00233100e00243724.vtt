 got a small from fall. You can't use those smartphones in internal to

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.930
 the ship in combat areas, restricted areas. But there will be nights

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:30.290
 when you go on the fantail with Bobby. Doesn't any time during the

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:37.650
 day or during the weekend. Right text. Um, it was a fantastic communications

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:45.010
 device that only Star Trek had. It was cold. Our navy. We

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:52.370

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:59.730
 ship will have WiFi that you'll need to grab, you know, especially

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:07.090
 when they report you'll be able to have good comes back.
