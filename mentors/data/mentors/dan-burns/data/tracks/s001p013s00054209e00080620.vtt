00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:08.430
that I had in my career or the U. S s life. You had a sore I was the simmering

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:16.020
 surface warfare officer belong to. And we were on their way

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.600
 in the Barents Sea. Wave over a bridge one and Celeste rupture. It

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:31.190
 ruptured right at a point where, in the latest X ray, he's way had what

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:38.770
 was noticed as some microscopic tears in the fire in your heart

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:46.360
 of massive tire. Sorry. Entire phone booth. Well, I was not very comfortable

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:53.940
 doing that because we had to go into the dry dock in Yakuza

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:01.530
 and replace the solar. So we were off line for a mission for out, uh,

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.110
 85 days try to get the sword. Don't out. Out. You know what replaced

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:16.700
 they're doing is action, and they're trying to figure out who's

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:24.280
 responsible. S o. I was all time in my career. Points only I can tell

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:31.870
 you is I had er well documented Tear in Seoul are noted everywhere,

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:39.450
 and I see said, Well, there happened where you know Ben 11th noticed.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:47.040
 Noted it in the logs. So therefore, you know, active God, it's that

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.620
 I couldn't wash it. It's wrong. Drum me out of it, said it was all

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:02.210
 my fault. But since sized at the foresight to look at it, notice

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:09.790
 it and say, Hey, it wasn't prepared in the previous upgrade. You know,

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:17.380
 I got lucky on that road, so I knew I knew the strengths, weaknesses,

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:24.960
 threats to my foot.
