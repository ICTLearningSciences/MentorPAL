00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.100
what can I meet their standards yeah elle it is a pyramid structure that

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:13.350
 are maybe yeah if the the the the little I say about that is all

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:19.600
 the standards are laid out so hi at the right time if the person was

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.850
 told to locked out of the U. S. requirements for advancing to rate

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:32.100
 and take the second class exam and failed to do that although I don't

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:38.350
 like to recommend you for second class and nobody whining about that

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.610
 but frankly one thing that you have to watch out for is is if you

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.860
 do have a free or out there and then the three lows make a lot of noise

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.110
 and a lot of auto gravitas they usually that means someone else

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.360
 is picking up the slack for that person you do we that out with your

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.610
 chief petty officer or the division officer figure out really stand

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.860
 watch god to take care of the people that are a little too the only

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.110
 okay you've got to try to take care of
