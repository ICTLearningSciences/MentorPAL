00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.650
How do you handle people that cannot meet their standards? You know, uh,

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:12.460
 it is appear red structure, our baby. If the nice thing about that

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.260
 is, all the standards are laid out. So actually, at the right time,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.070
 if the person was told to knocked out all of the peak US requirements

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.870
 for advancing to rate and take the second class exam and fell to

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:35.680
 do that well, I don't have to recommend you for second class, and they'll

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.480
 be winding about that. Frankly, one thing you have to watch out

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.280
 for is is if you do have a freeloader out there in the freeloaders,

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.090
 make a lot of noise and a lot of bravado on a gravitas. Okay? Usually

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.890
 that means someone else is picking up the spot or that person you

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.700
 have the weed that out with your chief petty officer ordered officer

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.500
 and figure out who's really standing watch. And you've got to take

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.310
 care of the people that are living up to their arrows. Going 100%.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.110
 You gotta try to take care of those people
