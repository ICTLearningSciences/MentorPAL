00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.940
hobbies. Do you have time for? So I like to you, maybe Mustang GT, which

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:15.020
 is that I would have liked 67 Mustang when I had my eye. So your

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:22.110
 car is something that you could get your walking out going to the gym?

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:29.200
 Um, that's pretty much it. Running, swimming, jogging, weight lifting.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:36.280
 Those were also things that I don't and you can try to continue

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:43.370
 when you're on your ship. Do that. What? Nothing. Well, played the

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:50.460
 same era. Waas Benched for Â£110.3 times. Those two could be an accident.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.550
 33 you're actually doing on purpose hurt. We got it. So little

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:04.630
 things for golf office, always with moderate. But I did have get to

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:11.720
 be a lot of golf during my time.
