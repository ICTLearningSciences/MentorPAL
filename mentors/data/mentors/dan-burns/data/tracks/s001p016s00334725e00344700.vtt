00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.820
So it's wise, uh, living on base or off. Ace? Um, that depends on housing

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.800
 nobility. Of course you did the waters that you're going to a new

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.770
 base that you can apply that day, Uh, two living to housing. So soon

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.750
 as you get your orders, you need to apply for housing. I would definitely

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.730
 recommend you do that because you don't have to take housing.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.700

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.650
 it on the list so heavily, Atsushi, get wars to area. Get yourself

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:54.620
 on the housing list. You take it. Oh, it's a good, good starting

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.600
 point, just in case.
