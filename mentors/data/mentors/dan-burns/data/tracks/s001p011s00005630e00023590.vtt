00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.710
Yeah. Your importance. You're something. You're Katie Command, But this

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:12.570
 you should be with the people in charge. So how should your relationship

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.430
 with your reporting? What about that? That is because day in,

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.290
 day out, you're gonna see that. You see that 40 quarters you can see

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:30.140
 is a meal hours in the wardroom. You can see it at the colors, that

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.000
 same standing watch, general quarters. So you have to have a professional

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.860
 yourself. It has to be a professional relationship with a good

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.720
 relationship with. But you can come in and say so my need to talk

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.580
 to you. I have a situation that I have not experienced. And I get so

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:59.440
 us you want to be able, you'll know that you have a good relationship

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.300
 with your reporting seen here. When it gets to that time were you

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.160
 understand? You can knock on the door and ask you a question. You

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.010
 don't wanna be going in there all the time. And you're wasting time.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.870
 No senior officers gonna say you're wasting time. They want you to

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.730
 be self reliant, but your self reliant to the point where you could

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:34.590
 finally go knock on the door. Say, have you experienced this? I'm just

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.450
 trying. Just want your advice to look at that
