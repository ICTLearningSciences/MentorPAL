00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.330
so how do you get the family involved with the next step the next career

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:13.810
 stuff so frankly you'd better have you why your significant other

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:20.290
 why for me styles for may to fall from the get go okay so no matter

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:26.770
 I go Norfork and then the she was sure from there and figure out where

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:33.260
 we're going so as we do what should but we're going to a new ports

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.740
 we have to go about selling your so you'll get some house hunting

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:46.220
 leave and you want to take the family that's about the only this time

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:52.700
 you want to let everyone know you don't want to come home on a Friday

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:59.180
 is that how you were moving so San Diego on Monday are you mad

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.660
 or another word for that when we would use that kind of logic I believe

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:12.140
 communications and happy spouse happy life so definitely keep spouse

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.620
 of all in the kids you know to get kids off called little surprise

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:25.100
 for one reason they follow you around the world you know they don't

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.580
 want to know that they're moving so as soon as you know you should

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.070
 tell the way that suits you find out you should tell I will say as

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.550
 you get senior in right the shorter time frame that you're going to

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:51.030
 find that out in fact funniest story though is one in the ages versions

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.510
 will be built in the Reagan years one commanding officers without

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.990
 any graduate but it isn't far wardrobe and what they will gather

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.470
 also log and I will say he was hold fifty four well the skipper for

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.950
 whole fifty three I partner so all skipper for all food before I go

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.430
 to fifty three news so they did a lot of sense fewer news fifty four

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.910
 was of course a non so it's kind of funny the way moves to work out

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:36.390
 what yours is the one that's already is is just you know as you your

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.880
 senior and now that information as I wish you would also you're also

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.360
