00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.330
So how early do you get the family involved with the next step? Um, next

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:13.810
 career stuff. So, frankly, you better have your wife. Your significant

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:20.290
 other wife for Mae Smiles for May involved from the get go. Okay,

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:26.770
 So you're married, go north, walk, and then we're gonna choose a

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:33.260
 ship from there and figure out where we're going because we knew what

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.740
 should like. We're going to Newport's. We have to go house hunting,

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:46.220
 so you'll get some house hunting leave, and you want to take the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:52.700
 family. That's about the latest. You want to let everybody know you

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:59.180

 Diego on Monday. Very brave man. Or another word for that. You might

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:12.140

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.620
 spouse. Happy life. So definitely people spouse involved. And the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:25.100
 kids. You know, kids kids are called military brats for one reason.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.580
 They follow you around the world. Um, you know, they're gonna want

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.070
 to know that they're moving. So that's what if you know, you should

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.550
 tell him the way I assumed you. Find out you should. I will say as you

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:51.030

 for Whole 54 to go to 53. Who says he doesn't have a sense of humor?

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.910
 The new skipper for 54 was, of course, ain't on academy. It's funny

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:36.390
 the way it was hurt when your suit. So the boy that sorry? Is it just,
