00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.110
I am Navy Captain Dan Burns, graduates of the Naval Academy in 1984. I

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.380
 am a surface warfare officer Ship driver served on two ships out of

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.640
 the Pacific L P D and screw. It's out of hand. I went to the U S. Naval

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.910
 Postgraduate School in Monterey, and after that, served on my department

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.170
 tours Chief engineer on a fast forget out of Charleston and

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.440
 on the actual USS Ticonderoga out of Normal. Oh, deployed on both

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:37.700
 of those tours with the USS Teddy Roosevelt, Natalie's on both ships

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.970
 and then went ashore to the awesome military affairs at Central Intelligence

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.230
 Agency. While there, I screamed for XO of Aegis cruisers and

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.500
 command of a small ship. But frankly, at that point my second child

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.760
 had been born and I decided to resign my active duty commission and

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.030
 joined the reserves. I finished out my 30 year career in the reserves.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.290
 I was recalled once during that time for a total of 18 years of

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.560
 active duty, 12 years and reserves, and I retired in July off 2014
