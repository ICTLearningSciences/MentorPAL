How do you ensure that boring work gets done? Okay, one, It's back to

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:15.020
 the old phrase. Expect what you inspect. So if work gets done, Shit

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:22.100
 shot. Who is signing off on that work is a famous story about by several

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:29.190
 Captain McCoy. I sat with toys and a bunch of city engineers out

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:36.270
 too prepared USS San Antonio. San Antonio is it is figure ship on

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.360
 Burger Stern Gate got stuck in Operate on the main missions with your

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:50.440
 ship is what? Well, ops. You have to have a working Thursday. Everyone

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:57.530
 was worried. Probably a little coin. Nazi Nazi engineers got a

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.610
 plan. They fixed it. Okay, Have a question for you. Uh, who signed off

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.700
 on that ship? Who accepted that? Show us names. Oh, yeah. Oh, that

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.780
 c. I'm thinking he didn't send the same engineers out fixing that

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.870
 signed off on. So no way to know what you need to get. You have to understand
