00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.500
so fatigued work. And it does happen. You know, uh, it's they say that

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.140
 the navy runs on coffee. Yes, all are smaller. That war to be over.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:20.790
 Ladies on. Personally, I was always a great judge of bad coffee because

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:27.430
 we didn't have a Starbucks on four of my ship, actually, for my

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:34.080
 ships, we didn't at Starbucks. You could maybe go to a start. But we

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:40.720
 have Starbucks stuff on fancy electrolytes and all that good stuff.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:47.370
 So we'll handle fatigue. It goes back to the old phrase of our wooden

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.010
 ships. You have to be in shape here after coffee. Uh, you have to

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:00.660
 watch yourself whatever it takes advising anyone to beat to crap out

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.300
 of themselves and slot before you know you're trying to stay off

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.950
 Wait. Especially if you're on the bridge and you've gotta watch you

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.590
 paddle a lion to stay away to get up to get the next watch. Believe

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:27.240
 it because you have 300 souls depending upon you and your judgment.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.880
 And if you run the ship aground, wanted to ship because you're tired

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.530
 loads is well, excuse it all, so drop and give me another 20 on I stay

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.170
 away. The best you can. Let's go. You know your body best, don't

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.820
 you?
