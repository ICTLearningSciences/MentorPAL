00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.380
when the ops tempo increases. First, foremost get the word out to your

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.920
 team. To division should stop would where we want to get the word out

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.450
 because no one wants You need a pair of people, so they could be

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.990
 ready to ramp up to it. And there are going to be times. Okay, we're

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.520
 going to be doing unwrapped tomorrow morning, followed by a refueling.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:34.060
 Okay, there we go. All right, The plane. Our house. Okay, that's

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.590
 high up step over that day. I sure hope it's a Saturday, so I could

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.130
 take off on somebody. You have a light duty day on Sunday, but you

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.660
 can't bail on some days at sea being a day off. Hopefully, there are

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.200
 some times, hopefully something that you took out, you could wind up

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.730
 spending Sunday afternoon in the Bering Sea. And they always over

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.270
 on the bridge, in which case you're not taking off. On some day, you

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.800
 try to make sure that the ship it's ready and obstinate. Bo doesn't

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.340
 change this ship. Appreciator machinery. Yeah, off. Simple high up

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.870
 several puts that effect on you as a original. Sir. You have to make

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.410
 sure that that machinery doesn't quit. Betty, come off one do you do

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.940
 for claimants and bring it back up on four, right? And then just run

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.480
 ops, tempo, effects, hops person, and you're gonna go through periods

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.010
 of it. But first of all, the way to be ready for is to get down

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.550
 and then excuse me with a smile. No one likes it that that's a commission.
