00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.300
it's junior officer aboard your ship before it's gonna be very important

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.750
 for you to earn the trust and respect of men and women in your division.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.200
 One of the easiest things to do for that is to get up. Get out

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.650
 of your state, out of the water, Out of a longer go along the debts

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.100
 off your personnel, Go follow the messages of the watch. And I'm

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.550
 not just talking about your initial qualifications that you would have

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.000
 to do is part of your peak US, your personal qualifications stand

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.450
 personal qualifications system, US points. Am I talking about getting

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.900
 points? I'm talking about getting up and you know you want to turn

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.350
 in for the night. You got one more hour of rack time or do you want

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.800
 to go walk to death? You'll find the message of the watch will climb

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.250
 down light mine shaft bearing, you know, go take the loot wall temperatures.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.700
 Okay. And do that for everyone. Chef. Bearing on your ship,

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.150
 that is easy. Just walking the deck management by walking around,

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.600
 walking around and checking out on what you're moving. So you actually

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.050
 learn it's important for you to learn your ship. Every ship is

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.500
 different to lead out a little bit different. All of ships line. They're

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.950
 supposed to be laid out the same, but some are not. It is you're

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.400
 in from bad it is. You have to go down to a given space and check

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.850
 something else with flooding damage control. The only way to do that

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.290
 is by walking around. What better way to hurt? You know, trust and

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.740
 respect of your personal else by walking it with another example You

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.190
 give not a divisional officer level, but a za chief engineer. We're

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.640
 getting ready to launch the RHIB and your every ship will have away

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.090
 boat. In this case, most of them are The Ridge Way had just gotten

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.540
 to the ships. So we had to launch the RHIB, while part of a few of us

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.990
 for that is you tested once. Well, there's a conflict in the instructions.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.440
 The post in base at just the engine. What a gas. The plant

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.890
 maintenance system is Do not test. Without water forming on the most

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.340
 middle watch could have damaged the ship. Once that was explained to

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.790
 may, we wrote a procedure to take care of that and get it. And the

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.240
 A gator Very happy for you that the ship won't be damaged. Everything

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.690
 And that he put the word out. The engineer stuck on for the egg angers

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.140
 over with Postmates. So engineers win. Engineer Score one. Most

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.590
 amazing. So I was for my dough, But just there's gonna be a lot of

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.040
 examples. Where? Mushroom walking a while. You won't find these examples.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.490
 If you stay in your state grow if you stay in the wardroom. Okay.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.940
 You're not gonna want your shit. You're not gonna that it is not

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.390
 a good way to start your career. You want to walk around, You want

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.840
 to know your ship, You want to know?
