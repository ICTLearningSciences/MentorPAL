00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.740
also on board your ship the first it's going to be very important for

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.630
 you to earn the trust and respect of the other women in your division

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.520
 all of the easiest things to do for that is to get out get out of

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.420
 your state or out of the water out of the law go walk the decks of your

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.310
 personnel follow the messages of the watch I was just talking about

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:36.200
 your initial qualifications that you would have to do is for your

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.090
 PC west your personal qualifications for personal profit vision system

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.980
 request boys about talking about getting points all talking about

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.870
 getting out and you know you want to turn in for the night you got

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.770
 one more hour of racks or do you want to go well that that so far

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.660
 the lesser the watch climb down the wire yeah you know and go take the

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.550
 little wall temperatures okay and do that for everyone ship bearing

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.440
 on your ship date that is easy just walk in there that is read by

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.330
 walking around walking around and checking out on what you're looking

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.220
 at so you actually lower it's important for you to a larger ship

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.120
 date every ship is different leave it out a little bit different all

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.010
 ships log is supposed to be laid out the same also Martin it is you're

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.900
 in combat if you have to go down to a different space check something

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.790
 else of wanting to have control the only way to do that is by

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.680
 walking around what better way to burn of the trust and respect of your

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.570
 personnel is by walking in with that is that what you do about the

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.470
 division also level but as chief engineer we were getting ready to

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.360
 launch the red and your every ship will have away both in this case

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.250
 most of them are the rich and we had just gotten back to the ship

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.140
 so we have to watch the red well our little people ask for that is you

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.030
 tested once was a conflict in the instructions the closest base at

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.920
 the does the engine of the the the one main system is do not test

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.820
 without water for and the boss metal watch could have damaged the ship

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.710
 once it was explained to me we rode a procedure to take care of that

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:57.600
 to get it and the eight yeah yeah yeah they should all be damaged

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.490
 everything and then you put the word out the engineers yeah yeah yeah

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:09.380

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:21.170
 you're walking around you will follow these examples if you stay

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.060
 in your state or if you stay in the ward room okay you're not gonna

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.950
