00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.810
little fairy, same as Williams. You're gonna pay your federal taxes. Your

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.780
 state taxes could be deferred if your estate not working in the

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.740
 state that you resigned your whole record. So this is for merely my

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.710
 home record. Woz, New York City. One reason Brooklyn. So, New York state.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.670
 Well, then I left New York for 15 years. I was not in New York.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.640
 So for 15 years, I didn't pay state income tax. It depends on your

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.600
 whole record. You need to be familiar with that. Oh, and I would check

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.560
 the back. And also, when you retire, some states do not. Tax military

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.530
 pensions in New York state does not tax a military, So I don't

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.490
 mind firing right now. Manhattan, It's expensive, but outside of the

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:06.460
 city. So that's the thing to look at. Two is where you serving your

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.420
 last tour? Oh, and if you're serving overseas, there are exceptions

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.390
 for federal attacks too. So when in doubt, ask your dispersing officer,

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.350
 will he or she will help you with that
