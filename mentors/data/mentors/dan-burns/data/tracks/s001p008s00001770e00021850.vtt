00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.210
So my ideal team as a division. Also first aboard the ship, trying to

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:13.570
 carry out the mission with our head in the accident. Captain, my ideal

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.920
 team is working with my chief petty officer. Seems she calls here.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.280
 In the past, I had actually, on my first ship, I had a master chief

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:32.640
 Petty officer working, and he helped me extremely. So it was important

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.000
 to establish a rapport, establish a relationship with Chief Petty

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.360
 Officer and carry out a mission in my ambulance that I was an engineering.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.710
 Also watch. So I had to qualify. So I hasn't used my experience.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.070
 My knowledge, my training too. Get qualified. As you're also

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.430
 watch all the decks, all the engineering plant, understand it casually

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.790
 control drills and rely on my chief to make sure that I understood

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.140
 how all the technology works and how old personnel it into our division.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.500
 Our teeth. So what's important part is to establish a rapport

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.860
 with your cheese and later on it becomes your divisional officer. After

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.220
 that, you're always has it. It's It's very simple to do that, and

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.580
 it's very when and if that goes south, okay, because it was south.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.930
 You're not gonna have a Downing Street line having everything yourself.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.290
 Don't do that. Highly recommended that either recommended establishing

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.650
 for you, Chief, you'll have a great way ahead of you.
