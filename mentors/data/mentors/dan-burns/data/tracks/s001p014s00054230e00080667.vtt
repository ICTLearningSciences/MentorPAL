that I like. We're aboard the U. S s life had a sewer. Don't. I was the

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:16.890
 simmering surface warfare officer, too. And we were on the way in.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:24.910
 Wave over a bridge, one on Celeste rupture. It ruptured, right at a

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:32.930
 point where, in the latest X rays, we had what was noticed as Marcus

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:40.950
 tears in the fire in your heart of massive tire. So basically entire

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:48.970
 ship and wait, it is. Well, I was not very comfortable doing that

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:56.990
 because we had to go into the dry dock, use and replace the solar.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:05.010
 So we were off line for a mission of warfare for, uh, 85 days trying

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:13.040

 time in my career. Points, I can tell you is I had er well documented.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:37.100
 Tear in Seoul are noted everywhere, and I see said, Well, there

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:45.120
 happened where? You know Ben, 10 phones noticed, noted it logs. So

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:53.140
 therefore, you know, active God, it fat. I couldn't wash that could've

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:01.160
 thrown drum me out of it. Said it was all my fault. But since I had

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:09.180
 the foresight to look at it, notice it and say, Hey, wasn't prepared

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:17.200
 in the previous upgrade. You know, I got lucky on that road, so
