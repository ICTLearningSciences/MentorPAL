00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:08.750
so things that I've done really well as a leader, maybe. Um so I tell

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:16.650
 you absolutely, very well. I always live on my executive officers. My

 second hands. Leaders to be awesome. Petty officers two out a execute

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:27.730
 you write. Take care, Ward your men Science exhibition. Right, Robert
