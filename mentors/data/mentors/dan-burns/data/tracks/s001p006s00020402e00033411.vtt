00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.480
It was one question I would have asked earlier. Well, I did, Huh? I won't.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.110
 That's not something I was never shy about asking questions. And

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.740
 frankly, I have been my my old man was a CV and World War two and

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.370
 my older brother Waas, possibly five, at a neighbor's cat. And while

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:29.000
 the old adage is never volunteer for anything in the military, one

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.630
 thing I never found any hesitation. I never had any hesitation about

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.260
 asking a few years. Ask me senior officer's questions because A they

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.900
 wanted to buy you a beer. Now it is by your coffee, Okay, but you

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.530
 want to go and ask a lot of questions because they have for gotten war.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.160
 I have gotten more than you have learned to date. So if anything

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.790
 and we learned this mentoring session go as high students, there's

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.420
 somebody out there they have made their mistakes, would like to pass

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.050
 that knowledge on to you, and I would say, Do not be afraid to ask

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.680
 questions. There are no dumb questions. They literally are questions

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.310
 because someone has done it and they don't want you to make a mistake

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.940
 in the future.
