00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.690
When is breaking the rules? Okay? Course. Papa, answer to that is never

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:14.520
 way. Break the rules. Wait. Go around. Okay. The rules are there to

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:21.360
 protect you. To protect the ship. To protect 16. Okay, so the best

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:28.200
 thing about you, no one to break the rules, we'll break the rules.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:35.030
 Look at them, examined them, study them and figure out the situation

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.870
 that we're far is a waiver. That's your responsibility. That's not

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.710
 the team's responsible. It's real responsibilities, Leader. You know,

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.550
 Skipper, it says we can only take, you know, metric units when we're

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.380
 gonna refuel from the British ships. Do I have metric feelings? I

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:09.220
 probably should go get them. How you getting all that? You need to

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:16.060
 read the mobile so that, you know, when the time comes that you do ask

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.890
 for a waiver. Well, you would have done that in advance past four.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.730
 It was pretty good. I figured that out.
