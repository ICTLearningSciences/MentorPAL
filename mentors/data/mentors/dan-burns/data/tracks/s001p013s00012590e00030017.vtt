00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:09.420
so things that I've done really well as a leader Navy. So I don't absolutely

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:17.990
 very well. I always live on my executive officers. My second

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:26.560
 commands the awesome petty officers to out a execute division combat

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:35.130
 mission so well, I actually felt well what I've been told that he's

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:43.700
 writing fit reps on writing. You need the war's just official, maybe

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:52.270
 language. It's tiresome having perhaps, But you did, and you just

00:00:52.270 --> 00:01:00.840
 can't give. If you've got a division of the department of 150 personnel,

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:09.410
 you can't just use one 100 stacks. That doesn't work. People are

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:17.980
 not gonna trust you felt down by so writing. The figure up old is

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:26.550
 more art than sites, and you are right, and that's how you write. Take

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:35.120
 care, ward your men side life. Robert
