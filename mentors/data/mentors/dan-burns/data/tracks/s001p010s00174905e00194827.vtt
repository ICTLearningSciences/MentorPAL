00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.120
how I handle self doubt. Um, yeah. There's gonna be times in your career.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.400
 You gonna wonder, you know? Why am I out here? Why am I doing this

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.670
 job? I'll tell you a lot of nights. And if I were wearing my uniform

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.950
 right now, my ribbons on city, I see service deployed with four

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:32.220
 pins on it. Four oak leaves on it, which says, for two years, fully

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.500
 deployed away from the country with my family, with my whole underway

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.770
 at sea, Another year in hand. So, technically, I was away for three

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:51.050
 years from the States. Anywhere. What thing is, uh, nice worshipped

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.320
 robbery at night. You look up with the stars, you can see the stars.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.600
 You know what you're doing. You know your mission. I always like

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.870
 to look back for the ship. The ship is on the way and you have shifted

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:16.150
 colors from the fantail to the main mast. Ship is underway. You see

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.420
 old glory flying? It's flying because you're there. Nor mission what

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.700
 you're doing. Keeping that flag showing that for it's always been.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.970
 Um, I was advised officers will have a chance in Washington D c by

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.250
 and see all the monuments by looking Blake. And look at the Washington

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.520
 Monument. Look at what they did. Fact is that smart? Okay, they

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.800
 did a lot. So they do what they did. I think I try to stay motivated

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.070
 to do.
