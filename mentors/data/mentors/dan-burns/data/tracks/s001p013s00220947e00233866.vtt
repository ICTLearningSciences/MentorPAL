00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.710
When is breaking the rules? Okay? Course. Proper answer to that is never

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.570
 you break the rules. Go around. The rules are there to protect you.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:21.430
 Protect the ship to 16. Okay, so the best thing about you, no one

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:28.290
 to break the rules, will break the rules. Look at them, examined them,

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:35.150
 study them and figure out the situation that we're far is a waiver.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:42.010
 That's your responsibility. That's not the team's responsible. It's

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:48.880
 real responsibilities. A leader. You know, Skipper, It says we could

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.740
 only take, you know, metric. It's when we're gonna refuel from

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:02.600
 the British ships. Do I have metric? I probably should go get them.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.460
 How you getting all that? You need to read the book. So you know, when

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:16.320
 the time comes that you do ask for a waiver. Well, you will have

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.180
 done that in advance past four. It was pretty good. I figured that out
