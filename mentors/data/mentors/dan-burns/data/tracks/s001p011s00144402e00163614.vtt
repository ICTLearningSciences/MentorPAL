00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.460
so a CE faras management of civilian and military personnel for stuff

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.060
 you have to distinguish between the civilian personnel contractors.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.670
 But Resilient said, a lot more invested than the contractors, and the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.270
 contractors are only legally bound to there. So there are three players

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.880
 in that in that case, helping you. And the other thing that you

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.490
 need to know. I understand the military they're covered with inside

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:40.090
 the lifelines. That ship gets underway. Everyone's underwear. Civilians

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.700
 may or may not be getting underway with depending upon the size

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.300
 ship, because there are so civilians, that big deck aiders and on

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.910
 the carriers. But for the most part, civilian contractors, they're not

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.520
 getting away with it, not on a ship spurt. So do you have to understand

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.120
 what the mission is? What are they doing and then situationally?

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.730
 It's different when you engine shipyard, you enter the shipyard.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.330
 You know, Remember when the when the bow crosses Cecil off the shipyard

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.940
 commanding also don't want responsible. The ship was responsible

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.550
 course, but technically, you know the dry dock Captain always ship

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.150
 that, and the contractors are charge of breaking down kids, cutting

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.760
 up the ship and installing new equipment and making that shit better.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.360
 So at that point, the contractors become important very during into

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.970
 baby intermediate made beds available lose the I am a.
