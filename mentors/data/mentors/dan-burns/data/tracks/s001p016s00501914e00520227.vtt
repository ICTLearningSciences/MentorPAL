Well, what do you need to worry about? Retirement. They want, um, you

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.980
 know, there is a lot of talk right now about altering the retirement

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.050
 system on going to a high three or going thio competition for a wood

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.120
 que, um, you want to try to invest as much as you can if for one case

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:31.180
 option for you, we started through that, it'll take care of it back.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:37.250
 Also, the back end, you know, you're going is always you go get

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.320
 20 good years. And if that's in the reserves myself, Retired reserve

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.380
 captain Oh, 18 years active, 12 in the reserves. So I did not get

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:55.450
 a good 20 on my active side. I had a team, so I needed two more four

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.510
 more years in the reserves and it was able to retire on. Now I get

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.580
 my pay. Um, I planned on that. I planned on my health care. I probably

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.650
 could have done a better job. Something away. More money towards

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.710
 a 41 day. So whatever you can salt away, you should try. One of the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.780
 rules of thumb was easy enough. When you get your next pay raise every

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.850
 two years, you're called up into a higher paying Crockett. The capital

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.910
 raise put it, Don't touch it, that that was always a good rule

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:43.980
 of thumb.
