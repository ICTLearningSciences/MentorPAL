00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.870
with regards to what's called the Silver Bullet Wars by myself had a silver

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.900
 bullet tour. I took a ship from my second ship from San Diego

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.920
 to get your pad and then wind up living in Japan for much closer to

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.950
 years. So as a result of that, I got a silver bullet. I was allowed

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.970
 to go. That's why I myself going on. So regarding that was hardship.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.990
 Toe off. Want anyone with family doing that? So But you gotta think

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:43.020

 In the end. That was more of it on the ship while I was out there.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:07.110
 I have to see all hope was to Pacific. Had to see every port there was.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.140
