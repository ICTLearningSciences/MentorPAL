00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:08.020
How many hours a week did I work? Um, there's a difference, of course,

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:15.190
 Between working at sea on Ah, see, tour and working assure on a short

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:22.360
 for, um at sea. You're basically working 24 7365 You're working every

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:29.520
 day. How many day? How many hours a day are up and you doing your

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:36.690
 job? Rebel Lee is at, uh 0 600 and taps in the evening is 2200. And

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.860
 in between 06 and 22. You run around a lot doing your child job nation,

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:51.030
 and it's very satisfying doing at Chute on Shorty a little bit.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.200
 Not as rigorous, not as long on our it can be depending upon what

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:05.370
 the nation is doing at the time and what your job is. Shorter's, um

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:12.530
 readily stills. 0 600 And every day at 0 800 is colors. So from 08

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:19.700
 to 1700 5 p.m. In the afternoon on shore duty, I was usually knock off

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.870
 for short. That was that was good to go. Go home and start over
