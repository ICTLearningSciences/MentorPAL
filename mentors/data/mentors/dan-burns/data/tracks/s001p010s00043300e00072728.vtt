00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.310
You know, you've got a tough mission coming up for inspection. Coming

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:13.760
 up or getting ready for deployment. You're getting ready for. I'll be

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:20.220
 getting ready for ref trade. You get ready to go out and do the mission.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.670
 It's coming. How do you help the team get ready for that? The

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.130
 one being present Do hot slough off. You know, the weekend before Monday,

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:39.580
 inspections be around. Walk your dex. Tell you one for example.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:46.040
 Lots of funny At the time I did as a captain, as a captain, I walked

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.490
 the decks. I had a radiological inspection coming up and I walked

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:58.950
 through my entire building. Everything's good to go. Everything's

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:05.400
 labeled. Did I know that the contractors were coming in to I hope it's

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.860
 that weekend. No. No, I did not. What happens? Removed All exterior

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:18.310
 sign Ege interests image from all bulkheads. Doors. So on the morning

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.770
 for the radiological inspection, I just went and seed on Friday

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.220
 with my own eyeballs because we don't have the radiological inspections

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.680
 rooms designated because the contractors took the scientist. Yeah.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.130
 Whose fault is that? That would be more so. You know, the captain,

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.590
 you keep warning. You expect what you inspect. Should I've got in

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:57.040
 on Sunday afternoon? Oh, yeah. I could have done that way. Fix saying

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.500
 that we have ultimately repaired and have a great expections. Yes.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.950
 Okay, But if you are not present, if you do not walk the spaces, you

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.410
 are at risk, okay? And it's better to walk the spaces with your team

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.860
 personnel that are going to be showing off the spaces. So at the

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.320
 dry run and you will have a dry run for inspection. Stash crew, team

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.770
 member. So what you gonna tell the inspector when he shows up? You're

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:42.230
 just asking a question. You wanted it that way. That will allowed

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.680
 you to evaluate your team members knowledge, experience, training

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.140
 level. And is he or she ready for the inspections?
