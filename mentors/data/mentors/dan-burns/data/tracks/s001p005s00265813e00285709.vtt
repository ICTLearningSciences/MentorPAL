00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.800
so, uh, short duty. Uh, you you could travel a lot or a little, depending

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.750
 upon the mission that the command that you were at, for instance,

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.690
 what was that? The Naval Postgraduate School was a junior officer.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.640
 Um, I went out twice. One year following here. I went out three times,

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.590
 and that was for four days at most on each of those trips. As you're

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.540
 all sir. Later on, a Szmyd grade officer assigned to the also military

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.490
 affairs of the central tells us Agency I was an exercise actual,

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:48.430
 sir. On I would go to what they called was identified as the initial

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.380
 mid final planning conferences. These plenty conferences would

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:00.330
 be Monday through Friday. We're on a Friday, you travel days, work

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:06.280
 days in between, and I ran some 30 exercises in year, so that was quite

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.230
 a bit of travel that would be combined in there. Now, we had a lot

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:18.170
 of also goes back and forth that we were covering each other for

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.120
 all right. Said it was a fair bit of travel, but I was traveling about

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.070
 want maybe two weeks every month I was traveling for the CIA and

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.020
 doing my decisive ward back and forth. You could wind up doing that.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.970
 I know off all their officers that traveled as much doing other jobs.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.910
 And I know of officers that did Maur and other officers that did

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.860
 less. What? Again? It depends on the commands Mission of hours travel.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.810
 You're actually warmed up. You do it.
