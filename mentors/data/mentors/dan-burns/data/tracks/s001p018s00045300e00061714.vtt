you as a naval officer. Paperwork go faster. Well, if you figure that

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:14.870
 out, I would like to, Um a lot of the forms are pre filled these days.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:21.880
 That's nice. As opposed to To fill them out from scratch. I put them

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:28.900
 in and computer punch cards. And yes, I have done that incident

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.910
 because of traffic. Would come in on that ticker tapes way. Don't use

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.920
 tape anymore, but I can't see that The DT DT is that Wait Â£80. They

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.930
 are now the size of a two terabyte hard drive. Okay, that the weight

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.940
 pounds. So how could you make things go faster? Probably keeping

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.950
 files. Okay. Keeping fit reps. Keeping the forms filled out for eight

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:10.970
 reports that you have to fill out your pulse assistant film out for

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.980
 the chief engineer says so. I have files filled out that are readily

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:24.990
 available to you That would help you work easier
