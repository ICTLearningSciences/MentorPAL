How do you take the lessons? Leadership examples experience the train

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:14.000
 that you learned at O. C s flythe. Um, every day you're going to be

 every day's a new day. Every day's a chance to reach back into your

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.150
 offer and see what tools you need to pull out and news because you will

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.730
 be challenged every day. So there are gonna be so blessed is that

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:40.310

 we've put a lot of training and education into Lucius. You might think

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.030

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.610
 some point in time, so Mia leases off the lot so you'll use it later

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:13.180
