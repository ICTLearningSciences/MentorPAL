00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.760
How can you lead on? Um what a way to put that is how could you not lead

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:12.670
 honorably? One thing the capital right now is very divisive. That's

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.580
 the capital. It's like you. It's your ship. Such as water is that

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.490
 you're suffering. You need to leave honor, but you need to leave your

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.400
 men and women that are assigned to your command. You will. Easy.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.310
 There's an old adage about get up each morning. You look at the guy

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:42.230
 in the glass guy or the gal in the glass yourself in the mirror, you

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.140
 say, What can I do better this day? Okay. I act with honor integrity.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.050
 I will get you through your day. Yes. Well, tribulations, trials.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.960
 We'll get through the day. Okay? You take short cuts with your honor

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.870
 and integrity. They will catch up to you. Sooner or later, they will

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.780
 catch up. Don't be tempted. Don't go to the dark side. Stay in the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.690
 light. Stay with an act with your honor. Integrity
