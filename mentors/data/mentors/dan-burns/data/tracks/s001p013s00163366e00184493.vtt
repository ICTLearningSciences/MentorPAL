00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:08.570
How can you enforce the other? Okay, well, to assume that everyone's had

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:16.290
 a vicious species. I always got the data was really not a girl has

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:24.020
 gone down, so all right, But on the west, how do you ensure that your

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:31.740
 you know, it's operable in completing the mission? That's simple.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:39.460
 Expect, or you personally inspects. So if the next watch they were

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:47.180
 supposed to bring on, you know, bring number two boiler at a lay up

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:54.900
 and getting ready to go online on the old 400 watch and you come up,

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:02.620
 I had 400 take the watch and the wall is not, uh what's going on.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:10.350
 Okay, so it's things like that. You know, all of a sudden, you know,

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:18.070
 things are not happening. We're supposed to. That's it. So you have

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:25.790
 to turn around and enforce it. Okay, Um, we were supposed to have all

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:33.510
 the ships boats stowed away, and then everyone could go on the recall

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:41.230
 ships boats on stowed away, taking the watch. You could keep the

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:48.950
 watch. Do you still little boats away? So that's an indicator. It's

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:56.680
 hard. It's not like the battery. It's not academy environment. Fleet

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:04.400
 is not the academy. So but waken still expect that you would bring

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:12.120
 duty, honor, country, honor. Fidelity Integrity's with you
