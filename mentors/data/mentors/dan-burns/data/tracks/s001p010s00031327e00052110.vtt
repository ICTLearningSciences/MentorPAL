00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.240
it was one to recover from a professional bumping. So you try not to be

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:13.630
 zero defect. We try very hard. That means you're gonna make the states.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:20.020
 So the first thing is usually sitting top going. Remember that?

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:26.420
 Well, you do. You've got to get back in the saddle. You've got to

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.810
 get back up. You gotta try it yet you were going to be doing for ship's

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:39.200
 officers. You're going to be doing bullshit alongside station keeping.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.590
 Do not hit the other ship. What was her shoot? Times that we

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.980
 have available did that, especially with the way refuelings. So you've

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.370
 got to rehearse it in your mother. You've gotta find time to go up

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.770
 on the bridge, Wayne, or on the Flying Bridge. Look down and watch

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:11.160
 this. Watch someone do the evolution so you could have it fresh in

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.550
 your mind when your turn comes to do a calling exercise. So this thing

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.940
 when you do have a bump in the road a acknowledge it for training

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:30.330
 will evaluate the situation. Do not fight it. Do not fight that you

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.720
 what last one shouldn't want, right? Just acknowledge that you did

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.110
 for whatever and correct it the next time corrected in training. Your

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.510
 engineer gotta do qualify as an engineer. Awesome. Watch. Just do

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.900
 another engineering drill. Get held in here at making part of muscle.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:02.290
 Okay, this is what I have to do. That means acknowledging estate getting

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:08.680
 up, doing it again.
