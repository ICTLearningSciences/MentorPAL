00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.290
Now I live build trust with my team, and 40 team member or team members

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.740
 had a stumble. You know, the easiest things to do is just standing

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.180
 watch, doing drills. Just continue to do trust if you get the trails.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.620
 Right. Okay, then everybody's happy. Hey, I want to be part of that

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:33.060
 watch, too. The lieutenant has his crap. One sock on. That's that's

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:39.510
 That's the guy. Now I wanna follow. Okay, if you're having multiple

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.950
 failures on the drills and, uh, everybody's gotta do it again because

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:52.390
 of a drop, we didn't get the torpedo fired off on time because

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:58.840
 the total rage sent the wrong signals in that were misinterpreted and

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.280
 sold. Are you going to do that? Is to continuously do every day import,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.720
 doing a fire every day in court. You going to do intruder alert

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.160
 drills? So if you're the guy that's looked at the gala, it's looked

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.610
 at too, You know, I want to be on that team, right? Okay. If you've

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.050
 got a new person on the team that you need to work in, you know, or

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:37.490
 with you have him. Are the new team member walking here? You then

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.930
 can evaluate. Remember the new team members capabilities, and you can

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:50.380
 figure out where that person will fit and or if you need to do more

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.820
 drills.
