00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.570
So how much time do I do in a year, this this again would be broken up

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.290
 into. You know, when you're on a ship, you're not. You're underway

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.010
 with the ship and the ship travels. U percent don't travel too much

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.720
 when you're in ship's company on ship's company because you're traveling

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.440
 with trip. Now the ship get underway and go in the Western Pacific.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.160
 You go into the Mediterranean and you see all these courts, and

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.880
 that's a lot of great fun and a lot of great travel on It's still goes

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.600
 back to John Paul Jones and joined the Navy and see the world lives

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.320
 a lot of fun, a lot of travel when you're traveling with your with

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.030
 your ship. Um, when you ensure duty, that could be different. That

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.750
 could be depending upon where you go for your short. It could be little

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.470
 war. There could be a lot of travel. Um, on one of my short tours,

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.190
 I was at the Naval Postgraduate School. I really didn't travel

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.910
 too much there. I did travel twice to do work associated with my thesis.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.630
 So I had a thesis research and I have to travel a little bit Thio

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.340
 Washington and to the Midwest for two shores. Um, for my other tour

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.060
 short tour. I was assigned to the Office of Military Affairs at the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.780
 Central Television, and I did a lot of exercises. Well, these were

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.500
 worldwide global exercises, so, frankly, a lot of lot of travel there.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.220
 So if you're looking forward to a lot of trouble when your shorty

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.940
 you want to look for an exercise shop, get you around and you'll

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.650
 get to go to a lot of conferences. A lot of exercise is a lot of travel,

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.370
 so it can be had. You can do a lot of trouble or you can not do

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.090
 a lot of travel depends on your choices that it depends on how you

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.810
 execute those choices.
