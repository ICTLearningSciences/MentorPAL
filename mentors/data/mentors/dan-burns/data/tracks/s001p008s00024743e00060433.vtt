00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.200
my time is a junior. Also, how I lead by example was multiple ways, but

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.550
 I sure believe getting out standing watches We had long underway watches

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:19.900
 68 hours at a shop and going down and tracing the system's understanding

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.260
 with men. Women are doing on the watch in the engineering

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:32.610
 holes. And I would walk the deck a lot of times I would just walk

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.960
 Dex, see what the mission Waas. What is the messenger of the watch?

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.310
 Go call down to a woman should go down to after steering. Don't slough

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:51.660
 it off. What? Someone else? Do it. Pick up the wash law and go stand

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.010
 the watch. Go and stand the death. It's easy. A lot of times just

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.370
 go back to your state. They call it a night. Or you could take one

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.720
 more hour, Get down to engineering room, walk with Dex that, um, department

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.070
 had no no this war example of division officers. But as department

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.420
 head, as chief engineer, I was able one time walk down. I found

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.770
 out that you know, one of my head the officers had been working

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.120
 on trying to solve auxiliary problem for about three hours. He was down

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.480
 there all by himself, so I spent another two hours with, So that

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.830
 meant he was there for five hours. While I was at two hours, five hours,

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:55.180
 I fried. We finally got it right. Got it figured out we got the

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.530
 pump. Three settles and putting out, uh, expected. How's that? It

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.880
 was supposed to deliver. There was a matter of getting your right Caskets

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.230
 over a place mat. 0.1 of the master chief's that was on coming

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.590
 watch comes down, Finds out you've ended here. I just spent two hours

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.940
 in four a gang room, You know, he was not the best tree was like

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.290
 the fact that I had done very much admired If I was very upset that

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.640
 the chief engineer was wandering around the space is high school. But

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.990
 I don't love that Ben in, the chief engineer took out topside been

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:52.340
 the lodge where he could have been elsewhere doing things, but I took

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.700
 time out. I always take a time out to see what your engineers doing.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.050
 See, with the boast of nature to take time to well around, uh, management

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:11.400
 by walking out B w. That will get you a lot off traction with

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.750
 your division
