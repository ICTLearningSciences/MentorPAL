it's junior officer aboard your ship before it aboard, It's gonna be a

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.750
 very important for you to earn the trust and respect of men and women

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.200
 in your division. One of the easiest things to do for that is to

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.650
 get off. Get out of your state, out of the water, Out of a longer go

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.100
 along the debts off your personnel, go follow messages. Just sort of

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.550
 watch. And I'm not just talking about your initial qualifications

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.000
 that you would have to do is part of your peak us, your personal qualification

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.450
 standards, personal qualification system. He us points. Am

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.900
 I talking about getting points? I'm talking about getting out and

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.350
 you know, you want to turn in for the night. You got one more hour of

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.800
 rack time Or do you want to go walk to that? You'll find the message

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.250
 of the watch will climb down light mine shaft bearing, you know,

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.700
 go take the loot wall temperatures. Okay. And do that for everyone.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.150
 Shaft bearing on your ship. That is easy. Just walking the deck management

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.600
 by walking around, walking around and checking out on what you're

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.050
 so used Actually learn. It's important for you to learn your ship.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.500
 Every ship is different. To lead out a little bit different. All

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.950
 of ships line are supposed to be laid out the same. But some are not.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.400
 It is. You're in combat If you have to go down to a given space and

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.850
 check something else of flooding control. The only way to do that

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.290
 is by walking around. What better way to her? You know, trust and respect

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.740
 of your personal else by walking it with another example you

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.190
 give not a divisional, sir. Level but a za chief engineer. We're getting

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.640
 ready to launch the RHIB and your every ship will have on away

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.090
 boat. In this case, most of them all. The reds. And we had just gotten

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.540
 to the ships, so we had to launch the RHIB. Well, part of a crew

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.990
 up for that is, um you tested once. There was a conflict in the instructions.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.440
 The bullets inmates had just engine. But the gathers the plan

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.890
 make the system is do not test. Without water flowing on, the postman

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.340
 watch could have damage. Go ship. Once that was explained to may,

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.790
 we wrote a procedure to take care of that and get it. And the A

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.240
 gator Very happy for you that the ship won't be damaged. Everything

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.690
 And that He put the word out. The engineer stuck on for the AIG angers

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.140
 over with Postmates. So there is wind. I didn't hear the score. One

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.590
 most amazing. So I was for my dough, But just there's gonna be a

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.040
 lot of examples. Where? A mushroom walking a while. You won't find these

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.490
 examples if you stay in your state grow if you stay in the wardroom.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.940
 Okay. You're not gonna want your shift. You're not gonna that it

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.390
 is not a good way to start your career. You want to walk around? Wanna

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.840
