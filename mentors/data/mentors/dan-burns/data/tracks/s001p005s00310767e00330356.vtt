00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.640
Okay, So what gets romanticized about the human Davey that that really

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.440
 isn't that great? So I'd have to say in my own, in my own case, you

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.230
 know, trying to balance the at the demands of being at sea with a family.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.030
 And I had personally, you know, my daughter was born and I went

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.820
 away for the 1st 10 months of her life. I'm going back. And I finished

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.620
 my seat. Or I went to my short tour, and I qualified as an exile

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.410
 for ages cruisers, command of a small boy. My son was born and they

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.210
 wanted to send me back. Have to see for another four years. So the

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.000
 radishes, um, they're at a kind of warning off. At that point, I had

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.800
 done everything I wanted to do. I qualified for command to see I

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.590
 had been there, done the job. I've seen the world that I've been in

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:10.390
 every ocean on the planet, so I was not ready. I have the cheers between

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.180
 you know, my family and being my love, the Navy on I heard my wife,

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.980
 so I decided to stay with the family. But I will say I did go into

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:27.770
 the reserves. I was able to finish out by 12 years in the reserves

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.570
 and have a 30 year career. So it gets hard. That's a decision that

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.360
 everyone has to make individually, Um, and there's no way around it.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.160
 It's just a decision that you have to make when those trolls are

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.950
 born and you will have Children. Presumably, you know, in a 30 year

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.750
 career you may get married and have Children.
