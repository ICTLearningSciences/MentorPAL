00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.860
So what? I overcome challenges. Thio leadership is one for you right now.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:14.870
 You're in a smoke free and 80 for the most part underway. And you're

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:21.880
 a drug free navy. Other way until using what? I joined the navy

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:28.900
 1984 on a bitch of a neighbor guy like the one that was hot decades.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.910
 There was rampant drug use from the Vietnam era. Ships could not get

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.920
 underway, and that was a problem. So, you know, at that time, order

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.930
 zero tolerance for drugs and we started kicking people out and kept

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.940
 in a mountain way did that. So we had a drug for your name. And now

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.950
 it's very interesting that medical marijuana is allowed in a bunch

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:10.960
 of states at this point. Medical marijuana, though, is not allowed

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.970
 in our navy. So that's gonna be a challenge for you knew. And I'm sure

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.990
 those challenges coming. Okay. But we cannot have officers or enlisted

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:32.000
 on our ships that are medically, medically on wall eyed. That

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.010
 was not really saying I need my medical marijuana. Well, you don't

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:46.020
 need to be a baby that Charlie's at our home in your office
