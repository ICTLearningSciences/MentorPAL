00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.920
I checked with the personnel in my division departments on aboard my ships.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.990
 I was more of you want to say near far. I was more arms reach.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.060
 You will always be. You know, Mr or Mrs Ensign, Lieutenant Commander,

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.130
 you're always going to be looked at as the khaki you're not with

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.200
 the illicit grew. And that applies even if you're a Mustang, you know,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.270
 you used to be in the chief's mess. You're not in the business anymore.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.340
 You're in the wardroom, and that implies, you know, you want

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.410
 to know what your people, what their families are. You know who's the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.480
 wife? That song is going to college. Any special needs one of you

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.550
 aware of that and be able to talk to a person. First of all, you don't

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.620
 want to be seen is a machine or a robot. But at the same time, you

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.690
 need to keep a hand at arm's reach because we are in the professional

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.760
 obs way. Our men, women combat arms and there's going to be a time

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.830
 when you may be called upon. You go in harm's way, and that is part

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.900
 of good water. Invisible. You must be ready to execute the mission.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.970
 We all combat men at arms
