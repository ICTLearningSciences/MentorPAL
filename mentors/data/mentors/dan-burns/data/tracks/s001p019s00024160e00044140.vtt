00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.900
technological environment in which I worked. I was chief engineer on the

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:14.940
 war years, which waas the first ages cruiser to the fleet. Lot one

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.990
 ages one point what we'll say we're on lock 12. Um, so it was pretty

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:29.040
 high at the time over, Actually, I must admit that your system on

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:36.090
 the road all right, Now she is underwater. She has got the Davy Jones

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:43.130
 and technology that she was had while high tech at the time it kept

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:50.180
 coming. So what can you do to be better at it is read up on it, be

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:57.230
 available to be attended to not be afraid. That psychology go embrace

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:04.270
 it. Yes, you can. Because people say they love change. No change

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:11.320
 is change. Okay? Nobody really loves it because they're comfortable

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:18.370
 with what they just learned. How you're introducing a new baseline.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:25.410
 12.1, just 12. This Lord 11. I just got comfortable with my iPhone

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:32.460
 nine. I was 10 axe. Now there's a left. What was the matter with a wasp?

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.510
 So the technologies are gonna come, and they are gonna change your

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:46.560
 essay due to have an open mind to try it, fiddle with it and don't

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.600
 play with it. Try to break it, trying to break it. You're just trying

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.650
 to understand how it works. You haven't opened like that.
