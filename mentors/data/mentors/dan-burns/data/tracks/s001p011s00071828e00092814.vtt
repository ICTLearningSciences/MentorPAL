00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.750
So we're going reporting seniors that are registered to give feedback

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.660
 to you. You the junior boss, in this case, you're the junior all sir,

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.560
 and you're carrying out daily mission. And you're getting crickets

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.460
 from the chain of command. Okay, well, one thing crickets is usually

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.360
 a sign off. You. You're okay. Because people will lay down like a

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.270
 ton of Rex on personnel team members that are not performance. So in

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.170
 this case, you know your hearing nothing. Well, is that bad or good?

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.070
 First off, you might want to sit down. You're going to have formal

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.970
 get togethers, either at morning quarters, eh? Eh, eh daily. Sit down

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.880
 with the XO. Planning for training to be a t. You know, they'll be

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.780
 official times beings, and you could just or launch, you know, one

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.680
 of the meals. You can have a couple calling. Say so. I just wanna make

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.590
 sure we're okay. You know this direction. I'm going in. I have heard

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.490
 nothing back, so I'm gonna continue on course and speed told directs

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.390
 otherwise, and I don't believe heading into the rocks. That's

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.290
 always one way to do it. It's not necessarily a bad sign. If you're

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:41.200
 not getting feedback. It's just in this day and age. Frankly, everyone's

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.100
 busy. So you're not broke. I'm not gonna fix you. And therefore,

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.000
 I'm not deviated. Be back for the most part, suspicion that so I don't

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.900
 have to fix things that are broke before fixing in the bar. Feedback

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.810
 say that's always the case bump saying You can operate that, but

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.710
 you might want to check.
