00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.310
you need to worry about retirement. They want, um you know, there is a

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:13.780
 lot of talk right now about altering the retirement system on going

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:20.240
 to a high three. We're going thio competition for a wood que, um, you

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.710
 want to try to invest as much as you can for one case for you? We

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:33.170
 started doing that. It'll take care of it back also at the back end,

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.640
 you know, you're going is always you go get 20 good years. And if

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:46.100
 that's in the reserves myself, retired reserve captain, um, 18 years

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.570
 active, 12 in the reserves. So I did not get a good 20 on my active

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.030
 side. I 18. So I needed two more 12 more years in the reserves and

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.490
 was able to retire on. Now I get my pay. Um, yeah, I planned on that.

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:11.960
 I planned on my health care. Probably could have done a better job.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.420
 Something away. Money, more money towards a 41 day. So whatever you

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.890
 can salt away try one of the rules of thumb was easy enough. When

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.350
 you get your next pay raise every two years, you're called up into a

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.820
 higher paper rocket. Take half the rays. Put it that that was always

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:44.280
 a good rule of thumb
