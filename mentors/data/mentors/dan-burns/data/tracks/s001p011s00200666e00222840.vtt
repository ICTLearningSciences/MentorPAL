00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.600
may be different from the other branch of the military. It's the day's

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:14.350
 sail. They John Paul Jones. More thing about the Navy is way our suffer.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:21.100
 Like when you even anger realize the other way and sell old Arising.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.850
 You are part of that crew are on that ship very independent and

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:34.600
 forces you to be hush wars. What? I found much more self right, Then

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:41.350
 the army or the Air Force officers got leads are part of dates,

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:48.100
 said that, but frankly, the Air Force they return tone base. Okay, B

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:54.850
 to B 52 outstanding at Pratt, and they fly home every night. Okay,

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.600
 I'm out there in the middle of Pacific and I won't be home for a couple

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.350
 of months, so I had to make sure that I am well on it on this. If

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:15.090
 they get a mission failure, it's gonna turn around. Go home. The army.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.840
 The army is reliant when they're out of garrison. If they're out

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.590
 of garrison and there, you wouldn't find out war. Okay, but how many

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.340
 And yes, we've been fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan for 18 years

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.090
 now, but for the most part, that Special Operations right now, that's

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.840
 not big on being always missions allowed or 23 up, etcetera. Mom,

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.590
 um, there's a struggle on deploy on my boss. Okay, Take out the enemy

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.340
 and return to Garrison. Okay, Navy goes out, spreads diplomacy. Lets

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.090
 the world know this is what America is all about. And everyone wants

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.840
 to come to America. Still in the ward, destination for the planet.
