00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.290
So what kind of problems did would you expect? Division? Also department

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.720
 head to deal with As an engineering officer, I can tell you that,

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:17.160
 um, the equipment maintenance that's required we had the PMS the plant

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.590
 maintenance system to make sure that all of the way we had was maintaining

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.030
 that 100% of the vote. Well, it's hard to do is these shifts

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.460
 get over okay, and all ships get old. That's that's the point. You

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.900
 have to do a lot of care and feeding. Yes, if you you don't want

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.330
 to drive your car from the Pentagon downtown. Awful. That's what's that

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.770
 driving. But if you're gonna drive your car from the Pentagon, San

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.200
 Diego, that's a lot of maintenance. That's a lot of fuel. Meth. Take

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.640
 care of that car. You have to take care of your ship. You have to

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.070
 walk around and see phase, and you can't take things for granted.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.510
 Now one of the nice things is they help you. They give you a lot of

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.950
 maintenance manuals. And as the engineering officer, lead damage control

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.380
 officer. You have called damage control plates for the ship so

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.820
 you can look at things you can look at What is the expected output for

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.250
 the evaporator Sze in my time from or to my time? We had distillers

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.690
 on boil the water you boil seawater and basically make potable water.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.120
 Nowadays we have what's called Ouro Reverse osmosis two stars.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.560
 So we take water from sea water running through the filters toilet.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.990
 Often we get that. So a decision I have to make every days. Do I have

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.430
 enough? Uh, Stillings typically aboard my providing enough water for

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.860
 the crew. Do I have enough water for coffee and drinking? You did,

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.300
 Havel that, um is the U. S. Navy itself on on having that war and

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.730
 not being on what's called war in hours. You don't want to be a water

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.170
 hours. That's not good. So the U. S Navy Prize itself chief engineer's

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.600
 pride themselves on having ships that are 100% available, percent

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.040
 maintenance and 100% of drinking water of help
