00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.860
what is one question I would have asked earlier well I did ha I well that's

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:12.860
 not something I was never shy about asking questions and frankly

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.870
 I've been my model that was a CV in World War two and my older brother

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.870
 was a class of the five at the Naval Academy and while the old

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:30.880
 adage is never volunteer for anything in the military one thing I never

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.890
 found any hesitation I never had any hesitation about asking juniors

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.890
 are asking senior officers questions because a they want to buy

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.900
 you a beer now it is by your coffee okay what you want to go and ask

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.900
 a lot of questions because they have forgotten war I've got more

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.910
 than you have learned to date so if if anything we learn those letters

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.920
 I should go ask questions there's somebody out there they have made

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.920
 their mistakes we would like to pass that knowledge on to you and

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.930
 I would say do not be afraid to ask a question there are no dumb questions

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.930
 there literally are all questions because someone has done it

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.940
 and they don't want you to make a mistake in the future
