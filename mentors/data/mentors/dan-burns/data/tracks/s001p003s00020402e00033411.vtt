WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.480
was one question I would have asked earlier. I did, Huh? I will. That's

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.110
 not something I was never shy about asking questions. And frankly,

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.740
 I have been My mile now was a CV and World War two and my older brother

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.370
 Waas, possibly five, at a neighbor's cat. And while the old adage

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:29.000
 is never volunteer for anything in the military, one thing I never

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.630
 found any hesitation. I never had any hesitation about asking a few

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.260
 years. Ask me senior officer's questions because A they wanted to

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.900
 buy you a beer. Now it is by your coffee, Okay, but you want to go and

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.530
 ask a lot of questions because they have for gotten war. I have got

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.160
 more than you have learned to date. So if anything and we learned

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.790
 this mentoring session go as high students, there's somebody out there

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.420
 they have made their mistakes, would like to pass that knowledge

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.050
 on to you, and I would say, Do not be afraid to ask questions. There

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.680
 are no dumb questions. They literally are questions because someone

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.310
 has done it and they don't want you to make a mistake in the future.
