00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.760
of most if felt important decisions based daily as leader. Naval Officer

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:14.680
 Number one is knowing the status of my plant as division officers.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:21.590
 Chief Engineer, you had to know you were responsible for power. Like

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:28.510
 war of the ship. Ship goes forward at the power before I was responsible.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:35.420
 Stem to start feels the main mast. Frankly. So knowing status

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:42.340
 alot of your appointment. Because frankly, as in a lawsuit has to

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:49.250
 ship this way. You know, everything is not going to be 100% all the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:56.160
 time. I don't care. You are a new commission ship. There's gonna be

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.080
 parts that are gonna be broken down. And how is that going to affect

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.990
 your ability to carry out the ship's mission? You have to think about

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.910
 that every day. Do I have the right technology? Right Parks, the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:23.820
 right pieces, right, people to carry out the mission
