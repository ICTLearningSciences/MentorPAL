00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.330
You know, you've got a tough mission coming up for inspection. Coming

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:13.810
 up or getting ready for deployment. You're getting ready for. I'll be

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:20.290
 getting ready for ref trade. You get ready to go out and do the mission.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:26.770
 It's coming. How do you help the team get ready for that? The

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:33.250
 one being present Do hot slough off. You know, the weekend before Monday,

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.730
 inspections be around. Walk your dex. Tell you one for example.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:46.210
 Lots of funny At the time I did as a captain, as a captain, I walked

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.690
 the decks. I had a radiological inspection coming up and I walked

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:59.170
 through my entire building. Everything's good to go. Everything's

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.650
 labeled. Did I know that the contractors were coming in to I hope it's

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:12.130
 that weekend. No. No, I did not. What happens? Removed All exterior

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.610
 sign Ege interests image from all bulkheads. Doors. So on the morning

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.090
 for the radiological inspection, I just went and seed on Friday

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.580
 with my own eyeballs because we don't have the radiological inspections

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.060
 rooms designated because the contractors took the scientist. Yeah.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.540
 Whose fault is that? That would be more so. You know, the captain,

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:51.020
 you keep warning. You expect what you inspect. Should I've got in

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.500
 on Sunday afternoon? Oh, yeah. I could have done that way. Fix saying

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.980
 that we have ultimately repaired and have a great expections. Yes.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:10.460
 Okay, But if you are not present, if you do not walk the spaces, you

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.940
 are at risk, okay? And it's better to walk the spaces with your team

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.420
 personnel that are going to be showing off the spaces. So at the

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.900
 dry run and you will have a dry run for inspection. Stash crew, team

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.380
 member. So what you gonna tell the inspector when he shows up? You're

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.860
 just asking a question. You wanted it that way. That will allowed

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.340
 you to evaluate your team members knowledge, experience, training

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.820
 level. And is he or she ready for the inspections?
