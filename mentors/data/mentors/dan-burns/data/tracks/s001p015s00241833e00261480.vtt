00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.400
when the ops tempo increases. First, foremost get the word out to your

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.940
 team. To division should stop way where we want to get the word out

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.490
 because no one wants You need a pair of people, so they could be ready

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.030
 to ramp up to it. And there are going to be times. Okay, we're going

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.580
 to be doing unwrapped tomorrow morning, followed by a refueling.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.130
 Okay? We don't want the plane. Our house. Okay, that's high up step

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.670
 over that day. I sure hope it's a Saturday, so I could take off on

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.220
 something. I haven't like my duty day on Sunday, but you can't bail

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.770
 on some days at sea being a day off. Hopefully, there are some times,

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.310
 hopefully something that you took out, you could wind up spending

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.860
 Sunday afternoon the Bering Sea and takeaways. Oh, we're on the bridge.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.400
 In which case you're not taking off on some day, you try to make

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.950
 sure that the ship, um it's ready and obstinate. Bo doesn't change

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.500
 this ship. Appreciator machinery. Yeah, off simple iob. Simple puts

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.040
 that effect on you as a divisional. Sir, you have to make sure that

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.590
 that machinery doesn't quit. Ready you can come off line, you do maintenance

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.140
 and bring it back up on right and then just run ops, tempo,

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.680
 effects, hops. There's no and you're gonna go through periods of it.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.230
 But first of all, the way to be ready for is to get down and then

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.770
 excuse me with a smile. No one likes a complaint, that is, that's a

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.320
 bute commission.
