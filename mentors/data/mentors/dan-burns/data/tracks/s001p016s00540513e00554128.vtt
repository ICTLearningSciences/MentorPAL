00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.860
travel paid for. There is a system you are becoming familiar with. DTs

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:12.870
 defense travels Irv's is on. It's an overrated system. They pay for

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.880
 your tickets. You want you get old, you need to go somewhere you do.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.890
 You go into DTs, you plan your trip, then the contacts also supply

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.900
 officer will get you a travel about your number that supplies and they

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.910
 booked travel. And you also have your government travel card because

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.920
 he'll be issued that you haven't already been issued. And then

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.930
 they could book the ticket. You execute the travel, and then at the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.930
 end, you come back and you file a travel. He your receipts, anything

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.940
 over 25 bucks. Although I'm told that has changed. I kept everything

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.950
 every received over $25. Now you just file it. Fill that out. Um,

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.960
 we used to have travel clerks fill all this out for you. I think the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.970
 case anymore, you have to become your own expert travel, filling out

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.980
 those things. Probably the hardest part travel. We'll have to travel.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.990
 Make sure that you get all your expenses. That phone struggles for

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.000
 job
