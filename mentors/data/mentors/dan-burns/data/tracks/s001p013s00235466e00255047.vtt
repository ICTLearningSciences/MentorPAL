00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.280
I work with someone. Spots someone assess a model who is willing to change

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.720
 versus those that will not change. I learned that by conducting

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:20.150
 your day in, day out watches. You know your mission of your ship. Your

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:26.590
 squad is there somewhere you were only gonna figure that out by

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:33.020
 interacting with people in your watch and know. And it is important

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.450
 to know that there are personnel that, you know, they grew up on the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.890
 analog, took off and now also you want to go digital. Were uncomfortable

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.320
 making the change. It's up to you a leader to say Okay, you guys

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.750
 do it. Just say what I want You, you, your house. It's a work with

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:05.190
 you to figure out that balance you. It just comes when people say

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.620
 change is good. Good changes. Change followed us said changes his change.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:18.060
 Some people unstoppable change and there are others that are not

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.490
 help. Everyone deals with change. That's what I do understand your

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.920
 mission. That won't be long. Hey, by the way, we're bringing in a

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.360
 new riverboat. Next. You know that riverboat is nothing like the old

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.790
 partners that we had. It has a brand new engine for people that are

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:50.230
 trained on that. So you didn't do it, and I was awful for the mission.
