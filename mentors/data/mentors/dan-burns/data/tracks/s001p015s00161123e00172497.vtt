I deal with stress all the job. Personally, I have a big bag and three

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:15.600
 of my four shifts. I made sure that I was the person responsible or

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:22.970
 one of my officers or chaos. Is someone in my tea was responsible for

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:30.350
 the ship's. Jim wanted to be available, so I know you're on the mike

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:37.720
 right away. Some stress used weights. Yes, we wait. Wait. Just had

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:45.090
 are in place what you have. Perhaps you have reluctantly friendly

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.470
 equipment. Choose doctors and a steel deck that cards. We would do sit

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:59.840
 ups and pushups on death economically. Probably that good for the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:07.220
 body. Stress wise. You know, you do 1000 push ups. That's forget the

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:14.590
 stress out.
