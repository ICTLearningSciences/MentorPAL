00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.070
So I would like to say that way are in Not in a zero defect, maybe right

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:13.300
 now. So I'm not sure that that is the case. I don't think that's

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:19.520
 ever been the case. Not as accepting of failures. Um, So to avoid that,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.750
 you have to do as many drills as many run throughs practice around

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.970
 this dry run scenario planning etcetera that you could possibly think

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.200
 of. This is where the aviators have over us where they could do

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:44.420
 the simulators. Just fly the simulator, fly the simulant, fly the simulator.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.650
 I have been told that the pilots that flew the J 35 simulators

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.870
 blow a vast and got, you know, absolute a number one scores were

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:03.090
 then, at the least, crashes off the aircraft when they were finally

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.320
 giving. So run your drills while you're in a decade. Be part of that

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.540
 personally, as ah, Chief imaginary officer, I was always the number

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.770
 one nozzle and going into the fire, I always wanted to know how hot

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.990
 it got in those fires and great legs. That's where we went in my

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.220
 time for 55 trained. And you want to know one of your body Teddy when

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.440
 you have to go put out a fire. So what do that by doing? So do thrills.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.670
 Try to figure out what you can do that will help you be prepared

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.890
 for this zero defects mentalities that you're gonna be facing.
