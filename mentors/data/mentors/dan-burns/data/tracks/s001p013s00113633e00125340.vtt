00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:09.410
So something for me is a service warfare officer looking back on 30 years

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:17.980
 and, well, I'd like to have done no better start off. Things like

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:26.540
 to take a lesson. My old quarters environment with the N Y. Under

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:35.100
 Western, and, uh and, uh, I was coming down with a farm arm is walk

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:43.670
 through fire. You do not run. Are you on a strong shoot from the hip?

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:52.230
 We get earned. I'll be getting shot at that walk. Slowly evaluate

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:00.790
 a walk. And don't stop walking because you saw you will get swallowed

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:09.360
 up by a car. So you walk into a situation cess. You got your head

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:17.920
 figured out shark course or out of court.
