00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.750
So I would like to say that way are in not in a zero defect navy right

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.640
 now, So I'm not sure that that is the case. I don't think that's ever

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:18.540
 been the case. Not as accepting of failures. Um So to avoid that,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:24.440
 you have to do as many drills as many run throughs practice around

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:30.330
 this dry run scenario planning et cetera that you could possibly think

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.230
 of. This is where the aviators have it over us. Where they could

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.130
 do the simulators can just fly the simulator, fly the simulator, fly

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:48.020
 the simulator. I have been told that the pilots that flew the J 35

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.920
 simulators blow That's got, you know, absolute a number one scores.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.820
 Where then had the least crashes off the aircraft when they were finally

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.720
 giving. So run your drills. One you're acting in a decade. Be part

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.610
 of that personally, as ah, Chief imaginary officer, I was always

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.510
 the number one nozzle man going to the fire. I always wanted to know

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:23.410
 how hot it got in those fires and great legs. That's where we went

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:29.300
 in my time for 55 trained, and you want to know what your body, Teddy,

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:35.200
 when you have to go without a fight, So what do that by doing? So

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.100
 do thrills. Try to figure out what you can do that will help you be

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.990
 prepared for those zeros effect mentalities that you're gonna be facing.
