00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.070
we are in the market is zero defect maybe right now so I'm not sure that

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:13.300
 that is the case that's ever been the case not as accepting of failures

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:19.520
 so to avoid that you have to do as many roles as many you know

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.750
 one three research practice runs dry world scenario planning it cetera

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.970
 that you can possibly think of this is where the aviators have

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.200
 overalls where they can do this simple okay just fly the simulator fly

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:44.420
 the simulator fly the simulator I have been told that the pilots

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.650
 that flew the J. thirty five simulators bald **** got you know absolute

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.870
 a number one scores for then that the lease questions of their broke

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:03.090
 or they will find it give me a so one zero one you're active and

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.320
 that could be part of that person is chief editor and also all I was

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.540
 always the number one also made going so far hi I always wanted to

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.770
 know how hot it got in those farmers and Great Lakes that's where

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.990
 we want it might four of five five three if you want to know what your

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.220
 body can say what you have to go without a fight so we would do that

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.440
 is by the way so do these roles try to figure out what you can do

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.670
 that will help you be prepared for this zero Z. facts mentalities

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.890
 that you're gonna be facing
