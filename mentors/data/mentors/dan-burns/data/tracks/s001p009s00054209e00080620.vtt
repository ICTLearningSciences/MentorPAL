00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:08.430
that I had in my career or the U. S s life. You had a sore. I was the

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:16.020
 simmering surface warfare officer, and we were on their way in the Barents

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.600
 Sea on way took a rogue wave over the bridge and Salah rupture.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:31.190
 It ruptured right at a point where, in the latest X rays, we had

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:38.770
 what was noticed, as some are catastrophic tears in the higher in think

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:46.360
 of your are you positive tire? Sorry. Entire ship and wait. It is

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:53.940
 Well, I was not very comfortable doing that because we had to go into

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:01.530
 the dry dock in your shoes and replace the solar way we were off

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.110
 live a mission. Warfare out 85 days trying to get the sword dome out,

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:16.700
 foldout replaced, going inspection, and they're trying to figure

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:24.280
 out who's responsible. Okay, so I was a time in my career, I can tell

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:31.870
 you is I had er well documented. The tear in the solar had noted everywhere,

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:39.450
 and I see said, Well, there happened where? You know Ben

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:47.040
 11th noticed. Noted it in the logs. So therefore, you know, active God,

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.620
 It felt I couldn't wash that could've thrown drum me out of it,

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:02.210
 said it was all, like, false. But since I had the foresight to look

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:09.790
 at it, notice it and say, Hey, it wasn't prepared in the previous upgrade.

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:17.380
 You know, I got lucky on that road, so I knew my would do the

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:24.960
 strengths, weaknesses, threats to my foot.
