,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What makes a good leader?,"a statement that you hear over and over as you become a leader in the Navy is you have to know your people. I think that that's, ah, great quality to have. But you also have to pair it with listening. You have to listen to your people. So I I know that there are many leaders, um that have people come in. And then the leader just yelled at them and screams of them and says, You should do this and you should do that and then seems the way. So, um, there's a time for that. But for the most part, everyone has some kind of story. Nobody's out there trying to be evil. No one is out there trying to do the wrong thing for for the most part. So listen to their story, Um, and also be empathetic. So even if they were wrong, you should know, especially if they're young sailors. They didn't grow up the same way that you did. Um, yes, of course they can be treat out, but it's more important for them to understand why you're telling them to to do things a certain way and to get them on board What you don't want to do is instruct them. They know the right way, but then they leave, not wanting to do the right way. You have to make sure that your words come out so that hey, you know what? We're a team. You did it wrong. You understand that? You did it wrong. You're gonna be a leader for other people. So you have to do it this right way and you have to go. You have tow, have them leave saying you know what? Um, he was right. And let's do it the right way from now on."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What are the most important first steps in a new leadership position?,"I'll go with the second most important step, which is to know the material, to understand what it is you're talking about. And you might ask Well, how can that be? Number two on the list? Uh, the first thing that you, uh, that supersedes that is to know who to ask and where to get your material from. You don't have to memorize things. Uh, there's so many instructions, so many things that change on a day to day basis, it would be impossible. You make yourself go crazy, but you have tow have your google at your side. Um, it's not Google, but you have to know where to get things from. So down in, um, I t you have to know the person to talk to going to this website, you know, that's where the instruction is. As long as you have those materials. Uh, then you can focus on other things like memorizing things and, um, putting, putting it out"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How do you set the tone as a leader? What is the right tone?,"there are many tones that you can have when your leader, um, they range from being very, very direct. Especially if you're out there, you know, huge strong person, um, able to lead, lead the pack. Um, if that's not the style of the style that you were brought up in as when you were growing up, that you might want to take more of, ah, friendlier turn a friendlier, friendlier tone. So, for instance, um, people can come to you and you work through problems together. Um, it depends on the type of person that you are. But in any case, everyone has understand that you're on the same team. So with that in mind, when they come to you, whether they know that you're gonna be stern and strict and maybe have a few, um, strong words in there or if you're nice and sweet and kind, uh, they have to know that you know what? Like they're gonna give you a high five at the end of the day and say Yes, sir. Yes, ma'am, I'll go do it"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"What are the most common mistakes you've seen new leaders make? (e.g., skipping steps)","the most common mistake that I see new leaders make deals with them, providing information that they're not sure of themselves. As a chief, you always have toe think Well, you know what? I have the answers. I know the answers. And that's not 100% accurate. Yes, I am the person with the answers. But the more important question is where I get those answers from the reason that I have all the answers is because I have ah crew of people behind me that can back me up that have the answers throughout all of the people. And, um what first classes? The problem that I've seen in upcoming 1st and 2nd class is is thinking that they are the ones that that the information comes from themselves. And in that case you probably get some wrong answers. Um, depending on what they're saying. So, for instance, um, you're talking about an award. Oh, well, this award needs needs this and that. And you don't you don't need it. You don't need that block filled out. Well, some of those things could be wrong, but because they're under such stress toe actually provide an answer. They provide some answer the difference between new answers and, for instance, Chiefs. The chief will say, You're supposed to felt this block this block. It's supposed to be filled out like this. This block. Hold on, I'll get back to you And that's the difference between a strong and a week later."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"What problems need to be rooted out early, or you'll have trouble fixing them later?","whenever you work with a team. First of all, you have to know your team. And once you know how they interact with each other, uh, you're bound to find some kind of dissension among these peoples. Um, they have lots of time together outside of work. Um, they might see each other at bars. Some of them might be dating other people that might have family problems. And those small problems can actually filter in into the unit now. Generally, there's not so much of a problem with that. That's how come you have, like people high fiving and people joking around and people like, uh, tapping each other. You want that kind of familial bond? But, um, if there is a problem, for instance, like, let's say, two people are dating and then they break up, then they're not gonna wanna work with each other or they're gonna work with each other bad. And for the most part, uh, it tends to go away. But if you don't take care of it, it can grow to be really, really, really big problem. Um, people's lives on the line. And if you have somebody that doesn't want to go down and check on someone when they're supposed to, or if you have someone that says like, hey, argument with this personal yesterday and I'm going to give him a bad recommendation, things like that that could get really, uh, out of hand pretty fast."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How do I balance being close with my team versus fraternizing?,"there's this quote by Sun suu. I don't recall exactly the words, but the meaning of it really got to me. Uh, it went along. Lines of this, uh, the leaders that are most beloved are the ones that just, like, tell anybody everything, uh, next is most feared, uh, next to the ones who like, um, are really prized among everyone, but the ones who they're most effective are the invisible ones. It basically went like that. So I think that the mawr invisible you are as a leader. Um, even though you are controlling things from behind the scenes, uh, more credit that you give him, the better he'll respect you and you'll see it, um, devolved into the group. Ah, lot more if they take more responsibility of their actions. Um, even though they have a lot to learn and you are teaching them a lot, um, you don't want that to filter down to the crew. So, for instance, um, my first class would come into my office say, Hey, this needs to be on. I give him the exact instructions so that he can't fail. Then he goes out, and he described it to the crew. Now, little do the crew new do the little Does the crew know that I'm the one who actually explained things to him. But he was my, um my go to go through guy. And he's, um that's the way that you are supposed to handle leadership by passing it down through the ranks."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How much leadership should you take charge of versus letting your senior petty officer lead?,"there is a strong line that you need to draw between, um, your friends and your co workers and especially your co workers and your subordinates. Um, it can't be crossed over. They generally say that once you become a chief, all of the friends that you had, you know, if they were in your corner and if they were going to bat for you, then they'll understand the distinction that has to be drawn once you become a chief and they're not gonna treat you the same way that they did before. So you used to go toe clubbing or bars or joking around about the latest people on board this ship. All of that stops completely. So in that case, once you turn that switch off, how do you turn it back on? All the people have toe develop a new type of respect for you. Uh, it generally comes from the fact that you're very knowledgeable about your your subject. That's why you're promoted in the first place. And the second part has to do with the fact that you're caring for them. You know you're caring for them as a team member and that you're looking out for their safety. With those two pieces in mind, um, the balance will actually, um, come as a side point. Um, whenever they become the the same leadership position is useful. For instance, off. You know, third class petty officers become first class petty officers, first class, first class. Petty Officer has become chiefs and chiefs. Maybe they become officers. Once those huge balance or jumped, then you're able toe like I have the same communion, but, um, you definitely need to make that distinction."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What are the main things that a new leader must learn and adjust to?,"The main thing that you have to learn as a new leader is the type of responsibility that you have versus what you used to have. So, for instance, um, working with your hands cleaning the Cellini to sell your expected to go out there and then twist it off and drink it off and put the new one in. And, um, as a leader, you have to get that same job done without actually doing it. It's kind of weird, I know, but your role is to tell someone else to do it. And I've seen a lot of leaders have that problem, especially people that that have the new position. So a second class becomes the first class. I'd actually have to go down there and tell them. Hey, you know what? Get off that pipe. Get off. That's Lenny to sell. Um, you have three other people here. They're not gonna learn by you actually doing it. We know that you can do it. You've done it thousands of times. Now it's your time to put the wrench in that person's hand and watch him do it. Um and then, yeah, after, after about a year or two, they finally get on board with that. And that's how you become the next rank. After"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How have your priorities changed as your career progresses?,"my priorities changed a lot. Um, since I first joined the Navy when I first got in, I was always thinking about Well, how much am I going to get for school? Okay, put that inside. How much of my saving up for my time after the Navy. Um, if I were to join the Navy Reserve, put that off to the side. What kind of certifications can I can I get? What kind of training can I get that goes on my record that I can have for later on later on, You kind of realize you don't realize it's actually like training on you. And, um generally, most chiefs feel this way. All the things and all the activities that I've done are kind of they're not meaningless, but their second fiddle thio the type of work or the type of things that I could give to my sailors. So for me, my e is whenever somebody gets promoted, um, second to that is whenever anyone gets an award and although that's not necessarily on my record, I do get, you know, some kind of credit for that. Um, I just feel like it's more important kind of like handing down the torch to someone else, and I think that's that's one of the best things that you can have as you grew up in leadership."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What does it take to really make a change in a team?,"If you wanna make a change in the team, you have to be very clear and very organized. What do I mean by that? Let's say you have Ah, unit. Who? They're not really working there full day, you know? You tell them. Hey, you know, I'll go out and, like, fix all this equipment and then, you know, half the day is over, and then they come back with only one thing changed or two things changed when it should have been the whole things. How do you change that? Well, number one, you have to be very, very clear. Um, these are the leaders, and those three leaders are affecting thes five people. The place that I've been where that hasn't been, the case was very disorganized, and no one knew exactly what they were supposed to be doing. Another thing about being very clear. Hey, these are the rules that expect you to do You have a white board, you label number 123 claiming cellini cells change the pump, fixed the valve, and then you check on those things. Hey, was this done? It is done. Green check. Mark, Wait for the next thing um, yeah. So being being clear and organized are the things that I e I think make the biggest change. Uh, when it change needs to happen."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How has your view of this line of work changed over time?,"for me. It was really confusing when I joined. I didn't know anything about engineering or electron ICS. When I first came in, it took me the longest time to figure out what a ground was. Everyone kept saying it was the Earth that it was like dirt. You know, I didn't understand how it like, uh, match with electrical work. Um, a couple years in after hearing the same things over and over and over, you start to get good at it a couple years after that. Then you start to become a master at it. Um, a few years after that, then you're in the position that you can actually teach. It s so it's got gotten easier the longer that I've been in, just like with any other job."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What priorities would you recommend for a person entering this field?,"if you're going to join any branch of service. One of the things you need to learn how to do if you're not on board yet is learn how to listen to people you're gonna be getting a lot of directions on your career is not gonna go very far If you can't follow them from the simple to the complex. You know it's gonna be coming at you all the time every single day, several times a day. The way that I prepared for myself, um, for coming into the nuclear power school actually started training. Um, I took a conceptual physics course and I took algebra, and that helped me through the school. Later on, um, after going through my initial school thing, I found out that, like, uh, even though there are schools available most of the time, you have to actually train yourself. So learning how to read is another big thing that you have to know. Um, if you haven't been a big reader before, especially in high school or middle school, um, that's gonna change if you're gonna be promoted. Um, of course, there are lots of opportunities and lots of training, but the ones I see succeed the most are the ones who actually can pick up a book on their off time and kind of teach themselves."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What skills do you wish you had mastered before entering your profession?,"I think the best thing that I learned was how toe look up things. I tried Thio be the best leader that I could all the way up until I was the first class. And that was, you know, going on Google and looking here and, um, asking around and, you know, going to another office and saying, Hey, what's the policy on this, you know, kind of like, uh, wagon, my my telling a circle. But, um, before I joined the chief strings, and especially afterwards, I swapped up my leadership style. They actually taught me how to become a better leader. Um, a little bit during, um, my second class and my third class years, but a lot, especially during my first class years. And after I became in chief, uh, they told me which websites to visit. Uh, they told me, like which people in the separate departments toe go visit. So it's not necessarily a skill, um, of knowing how to do something but more about knowing who to talk to knowing that that was a resource that I had that I wasn't taking advantage of before"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What is one question you wished you asked earlier?,"the question that I wish I would have asked earlier earlier. Um, that was a really big surprise to me. Is the difference between the different ranks? Um, you have pity officers, then you have chiefs, and then you have officers and, um, they're split by whether you have a bachelor's degree and whether you've been commissioned. And I didn't really understand that critical piece until, like, well, in tow. After the time that I joined the join the service, um, for instance, people were being called Chiefs and Master Chiefs while I was in boot camp. They were saying, Well, you know, like if we don't do these certain things, there's certain things that, um, things first class is gonna make a chief and I didn't really understand, Like how you were supposed to be promoted along the lines of the military. Um, being a kid, I just thought, all right, your private I knew what that was, and I heard that there was an admiral and I knew what that was. And I thought you just joined. And then you just stay in. You get better and better and better at your job, and then you're finally you know an admiral or something. I had no idea about the rank structure. But now I know that separated by, um books and learning and degrees and evaluation marks and awards Eso I wish that would have been, uh, clarified even before I joined the service. Um eh, so that I could have a better idea of the structure of what I'm getting into."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"As a leader, how much more will I know about the overall goals of the work I am doing?","generally, the Chiefs know a lot more than some of his subordinates. There are times that I'm at a table and we talked for an hour just with the Chang, the chief engineer, the other officers in the units, the junior officers in the unit, about the overall goal of the ship. You know what? We have this ship in, uh, in Guam. We need to get it over to this other island. We have these problems with it. You know, this pump over here effects this pump be over there and without that pump than this other machine is gonna work, and you have to kind of understand all of it. Now, the sailors under you don't necessarily need to know that whole entire thing. It's gonna overwhelm them. Some of them have just been in for a few months. Others a year or two, and they're they're just getting the feel for the Navy. So they they're not gonna understand all of those other pieces of equipment or how they operate, But they don't need to. And that's the point. That's your whole goal as a chief, to separate the critical from the non critical. Um, so yeah, that our long conversation that I had talking about How we as a group as a ship as a department are going to get the ship from a to B. I filter that down to say, Hey, you know what? Third class, Petty officer, second class Petty officer, We have, uh, that's led to sell. That needs to be taken out and provided with this new one. Can you guys do that? Yes. Thing that that whole entire transformation of getting the ship from point A to B is just whittled down to that one small task for them."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What was the most difficult part of your training?,"the most difficult part of my training, I would like to say, should be new power school. Um, that's getting up early in the morning until evening. You, of course, have time for, uh, toe workout. You have time to eat lunch, But when you know, there's a test on Monday and you don't really know much about the material, you spend that whole entire weekend from sunup to sundown just studying. And I would like to say that that whole entire two year training that I had learning about electron ICS and he transferred fluid flow and nuclear technology in chemistry. Um, doesn't quite compare to the training that I got once I got to the USS John C. Stennis that a lot of, um, even non nukes are gonna experience. And this is what I mean, when you're in school, you're in a nice, safe environment. Um, the sun is shining. You can kind of see out the window, but basically, you're at a desk and you're typing and your writing and your, um, listening on did you don't develop too much sweat. But when you're on the ship, uh, you can have some days that are just as long or even longer. Um, when things could break because of you, when people get hurt, sometimes when you're falling asleep. But you're keeping yourself awake by drinking lots of coffee. You know that training on and it is called training because the whole entire time you're learning your actually doing doing doing thin learning, doing, doing, doing, then learning, Um, but that those years of my lives of my life was very intense, Thio, to say the least."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"You are having a conflict in the first few days in your unit, is that normal or no?","generally, the way the Navy structured is that you could take a little piece from one place and, ah, like, easily slide it into the next place. You shouldn't be having any trouble when you get to a new unit. Um, I've known several people that came from U. S s warrior and they were immediately put on the USS Blue Ridge and they slid right in. You know, after the second day, you couldn't tell them apart from anybody else, somebody that that just came in, he would not be able to say, Hey, you know what? Like this is a new guy. Um, that's the way the Navy is supposed to work when it doesn't. Then that's, uh, that's a time that, you know, you and the chief need to talk about what? What the problems are. Is it a personality problem? Is it the fact that you're dealing with this new equipment, that you don't know? Um, how to operate yet? But it shouldn't be that that case at all ast faras personality. We all try to be the same here. We try to be accepting opening a new person in the unit that makes our our unit better that makes our work go down. So you shouldn't have a problem. Uh, sliding into the unit assed faras work that you're getting, um we generally start you off at the level that you're supposed to be. If you're first class, you should know X, Y and Z should know how to manage your work center. You should know the equipment that you're working on. If you're second class, you should be familiar with, um, how to read Bull's eyes. How Toe transit about the ship. You know how to use the flashlight when it when it's called for how to use your earplugs, you know, basic PPE. So we put you in the place that you're supposed to be. And if you're having conflicts, then, um, that's time to bring it up to the leadership."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How you can lead honorably?,"If you're gonna try to lead honorably, you have to remember what uniform you're wearing. You have to think about all the people that I warned it before. And you have to make sure that you're not going toe ruin that name. The good name of the Navy. The good name of the military, the good name of America. Especially if you're overseas. Um, I'm not going to say that This is always so easy to do. I've been in ports where Hey, New Americans air here, and you've been underway for two months, right on Lee on the ocean as far as I can see, And you get, uh, toe land. And some of those values actually are diminished because you're in this new and exciting environment. But you have to keep in mind. Hey, you know what? I'm an American representative. If you're on domestic soil. Hey, you know what? I'm a military representative. And if you're in your unit hey, you know what? Like I'm an electrician's and they have to know that my chief and my leadership and the people around me take care of me. And they told me the right things to do. They instill me with honor, courage and commitment, and I have to make sure that wherever I'm at, um, that that's what's expected of me, and you have to live to fulfill it."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"What are some good resources to look at before starting (books, videos, classes)?","the best resource is that you can have, especially if you're about to be a new leader. Uh, deals with people. If you wanna be an officer grabbing officer and taken to the side Say, Hey, tell me about where you've been, what you've been doing. Um, what life is like if you're in the listed ranks, grab the closest chief and say, Hey, you know what? Like I'm, uh, I'm about to be a leader. Um, I'm unsure about this or I know about this, but tell me about your personal situation there. There's tons of ways that you can ask these questions. Um, books air fine. But I found that most people, when it comes to leaders toe leadership, they generally, um, based on experience and the best way for experiences to get it from a real life conversation."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Describe your ideal team.,"My ideal team is a diverse team. What I mean by that is you have to have a superstar that that that is, uh, e think that builds the most morale. When you have someone on the team that can probably do anything now he needs support. Uh, there's a guy that's learning. So if I had two superstars thin, what I would try to do is I would try to get one of the superstars off and try to get someone who's learning, you know, kind of keep it balanced. There should always be some kind of training involved as well. Um, uh, you got your admin guy, you know, that that's usually me or some kind of supervisor or something like that. And then, um, yeah, I think as long as you have those three pieces that are really good or at least learning, uh, then everything else is kind of like filter"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What things do you always make sure to lead by example on?,"The thing that I think is most important to lead by example on is following instructions correctly. So there are many, many opportunities toe kind of cheese things off, uh, to say, for instance, like there should be a nut that should be taken off off the off the top mast. And for some reason like that wasn't taken off or or something was left up there without a question. You know, some people going to say, Well, you know it like next time we're up there or you know what, No one's gonna miss it. That is absolutely unacceptable. Um, every single time, you have to know that. You know, if you're coming to me as a chief, should I blah, blah, blah or you're gonna say, like we think that it might be good to blah blah blah, you know automatically is shot down because there's never any question whether it should or shouldn't be. It's written in black and white, and whatever instruction says, that's what you should do now, of course, uh, in specific occasions, there are way that there are opportunities when you have a choice. Like, um, I can't think of a situation now But, uh, that's kind of not black and white, but for the most part, for jobs, Um, I try to lead by example by always following instructions and especially pulling out construction, reading directly from what it says and then doing it."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What are some tips to earn the trust of my team?,"If you want to earn the trust of your sailors, then of course you have to know what you're talking about. But no one's gonna expect you to be perfect. You just have to know how to find the material. So, for instance, someone says, Hey, I wanna have a really quality evaluation. Can you help me? What's good is being able to explain all of it. What's better? What's you know? Just as good is being able to fill out the first page and not knowing what Block 28 29 are saying, Hold on, coming back in an hour and saying, Oh, Block 20 is this Block 29. Is this What's bad is saying, Oh, this is how you felt the first page and I don't know, But this is how you fill out block 28 29. Once they figure out that you don't know what you're talking about or they find out the correct answer and you were insistent that your answer was correct and you didn't give them any any any buffer for that, then they're gonna lose respect for you. So just make sure that you you always present yourself in an honest manner, and that's the best way"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How do you connect more deeply with your team members?,"so there are many different leadership styles. You could be you direct, you could be friendly. You could be sweet. You could be stern. I think if you wanted to. And all of those can have success. No doubt, especially it depends on the person. But for me, if whenever I wanted toe really build a connection with people you have thio get outside off the work environment and I mean, I mean it like this. You have to know about the people outside of the job that they're doing. It could be learning about their family. It could be knowing about their kids. It doesn't have to be super friendly. It doesn't say, Hey, you know what? Let's go drinking on a Saturday afternoon. But it should be saying, Hey, you know what? I care about you more than just my subordinate justice worker that I that I have, um, I care about your life to, um not just like your safety, but also your well being. Um, S o tell me about it and get to know me, get to know you and yeah, that's the best way to build trust"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"How do I build trust between different team members? (e.g., new ones, ones with a bad history together)","one good way is to have things outside of the work. So, for instance, if there are morale, recreation and warfare things that you can do together, um, that would be helpful. Um, one thing that I used to like to do is like, exercise together, saying, Hey, you know what? This Friday afternoon, uh, let's put on a PT gear and just, like, run together. Um, if it's an easy Friday, then let's go out and play some volleyball together. Um, you don't really have that much opportunity to do that. Let's say Let's it, let's say if you're underway, then, um, there aren't any weekends on the beach. So what do you do then? Well, you have to make sure that the team has enough enough material outside of the work so that they can actually communicate with each other. Um, in a friendly way. That means make sure that they have enough movies. If they if they were complaining about their lunch, making sure that they're well fed, you know, go talk to the galleys, remember and say, Hey, you know what? We have this birthday coming up. Can you bring a birthday cake in Thio to celebrate somebody's, um, somebody's birthday. You could actually have this award, you know, before you weren't really considered an award, but saying, Hey, you know what? Like it would really lift the spirits off the unit, help somebody with promotion. Let me think of how I can, uh, come up with an award, you know, make some kind of jobs so that they can get that award when you wouldn't have thought so. Otherwise. Like, there are many avenues that you have toe, Um, just not shove work down people's throats and say, Hey, you know what? Like we're in a team. I know this place is really long. You're sweating a lot, but let's figure out something else that you can do toe actually smile once once in a while."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What are good strategies to have the right kind of presence with my team?,"the right presence to have is for everyone to know. They're all, um do people have to understand that? You know what? Like I can't boss anyone around first class, petty officers have to understand. Hey, you know what? I was the second class, you know, a couple of months ago. I don't have the right to boss them around, despite my my new title. Chiefs have to understand. Hey, you know what? Even though I can boss people around, I don't want to, because they have to work for me. And officers have to realize that Yes, I have a commission. And yes, I am your commissioned officer, but, um, ultimately, you guys are the ones doing the work, and I have to respect that. So if everyone knows their role and they don't abuse their rules, uh, that's the best way to get along. So how can you do that? Well, you have to make sure that each of those lines is very, very clear. Um, this is our officer. He's in charge of X y Z. Um, if he spends most of his time up in the office, you know, that's fine, but it should be clear to the unit that he is serving a really good role. You know, you can't just say, Oh, we have an officer and you never talk about him. You never talk about his rules, his responsibilities. You know that's not good for the team because they don't develop a reporter with him. So I have to say, as an officer, he has a different rule than you guys. He's not down here working on equipment. He's not down here. Um, you know, cranking valves. I I want to say that because when I was coming up through the ranks, I didn't understand this difference. And I had a little resentment towards some of the officers that I saw was like, Hey, you know, we're down here sweating. We're busting our chops. How come I never see him? Um, now, as a chief, I make sure to explain that role toe the team toe to make sure that everyone understands everyone is working really hard. Um, and also explain the newest person you know, to the officer. Hey, you know what? Like even though he's just knew, you know, you have to realize, even though you don't see it, but he's down there in the build, getting his brand new uniformed dirty, you know, scrubbing and chipping and painting. You know, just to make sure that, you know, um, he's a valuable member of the team. So as long as everyone knows the value of each member of the team and it's very, very clear and there's no, uh, there's no crossing over, then that's how you build report with the team."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How do you and your work colleagues socialize outside of work?,"the way I socialized various, depending on where I'm at. When I was in the, um, active duty, I only had a couple of friends. We would actually used to live with one and basically just work. Um, maybe we're separate, or maybe we're together, but, you know, it varied, but we both go home together, And we, um you know, you only have a drink. You know, Netflix goto bars and pools and things like that, but at other places, um, for instance, like when I'm in the Navy Reserve, Um, you generally, once work is over, you just go home to your to your family. Um, you just see each other for those couple of days out of the month. Um, sometimes when I'm on A T and your training for the Navy Reserve Um, let's see, I packed my bags up, put on my uniform, and I work for the Navy at a shipyard for two whole weeks. Uh, that's when you develop a lot of report as a reservists. That's when you're all there together to come there as ah, you know, 12 person group may be different. Um, rates. So there's a mechanic over here and electrician's over there. But generally on the weekends we find some something with NWR to go do together we go to soccer festival. If we're in Japan, we go. We gather up all the troops up together on a Saturday. We visit Boston if we're in, uh, in New Hampshire, Um, yeah. We generally find things to do outside of work on t help us grow together."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How should your relationship be with your subordinates? (close vs. far),"When you're dealing with subordinates, you have to make sure that they understand your authority and you never want to cross down to them. So there have been many times that I've taken people to the side after like, let's say, a heated argument, you know, kind of let him know that I'm a person, that he's a person in my eyes, Um, and even though you want to be their friend, you're not really allowed to, um, not until they're your level. So, for instance, if there a chief, then maybe you're allowed to do that. But because there's that there's that line that if other people saw you and realize that you were friends, then they would have They wouldn't have the same opinion. I think that they can promote at the same rate as that other person. That's why you choose not to be friends with another person with a subordinate. Now that's not saying that you can't be friendly. Friendly is still trying to understand about their their life, their personality, their spouse, their kids, um, wanting to know that information. You know, it helps you smile. It helps the day go by it well, but you can't go over their house and play cards with them. You can't, uh, sit down with them at a bar and just drink. You know, the night away. All that has to go out the window once you, um, get promoted through the ranks."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"How do I help my team prepare for a tough mission? (e.g., inspection, long mission)","the best way that you could help prepare for our mission, especially a strenuous mission, is to give them knowledge about what's to come. I recently just got off this in serve tour on the USS Blue Ridge. And as far as the team was concerned, there's thousands and thousands of jobs to be completed. Their tons and tons of work hours to be had, Um when I when I got there, I think they were waking up in the morning and then they wouldn't get to bed until, like, 10 or 11 o'clock at night when I would get when I would, uh, finally tell him to break off for the night. And I think one of the issues was they didn't know how long it would last. Is this gonna be how all of deployment is gonna be? Is it? Are we gonna ever let up this weekend next month? When does it stop? If you had a plan about what things they're supposed to be completed and the amount of time they're supposed to take and you divided up in the equal portions and they could actually see what they're working on. Then they come in with a sense of saying, Hey, you know what? I'm gonna do this thing. And the longer I work, the closer I get to that goal. And with that in mind, then I think that will give them a better understanding about what they're supposed to do with their job. Without that information. Um, you kind of get depressed. You kind of get like down about how much work there is to be had."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What kinds of people will I work with? In terms of personalities.,"you're gonna work with so many different types of people is gonna So there are big, tough guys who wanna boss people around. There are people who have, ah, slightly racist twinge to them, based on how they grew up, that you're gonna have toe, you know, hop over. Um, there are some people especially, um, people that have been in for a long time, uh, that are know it alls who like there's nothing that you can say to them that is right. You've been in for two years. He's been in for six years. And whether he's right or wrong, you're gonna accept his opinion. You know, like there, there, people from the South who have an accent. There are people from the north who, um, are are wealthy and think that the job might be beneath them. They're they're Californians versus, um, New Yorkers. And there. Is that gonna be that clash among cultures? Um, some people are very, uh, engaged with with doing college like things. Um, you know, you're gonna have we hope that this disappears, But the guy that drinks, you know, all the time, and it's gonna get so many like red badges that says he can't go off the ship because, like, he, uh, was pushing someone in a bar last night. You know, um, there's some people who just don't wanna listen, you know, And and ultimately, they might be kicked out. Um, on they're the superstars as well, who you really, really want to learn from. You know, they it's amazing that you both went to the same boot camp. You both went to the same school. And yet here you are. Ah, year and two months later, he's already being promoted. And he has so much knowledge. And you're wondering, how did we start at the same place? And he's at the place that he's at, You know, there's a wide range of people that you have tow encounter. And you know what? That's the one of the things that makes the Navy great"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What kinds of people respond better to certain leadership strategies?,"one of the most important things that achieve can learn is, uh, to know your people. That's one of the best piece of advice that Chief can have. So you always have to, like, change your your tone based on the person that you're facing. So if you're facing, uh, a really stand up guy who really knows his things, you can talk straight to him. You don't have to, like, filter your words. It all you can say, Hey, you know what? Like we need you to do this, you're not doing it or we need you to do this. And you've been great at it. You know, you could just, like, filter out just fine. There are other people who, like are very you know, you say three things to them and they start crying in a corner, right? You want them toe slowly change there. They're mode to beam or strong, but you definitely don't want to scam away. So, like you also have to like, modify your words. You can't use stronger words you have tow. Um, slowly build up to the thing that you want to say. You know what? Hey, you know what we need you up there. Um, toe paint. Now, if you just said, Hey, you're gonna do this, go up there and paint, you know, with one person, that would be just fine. Okay, Sure. No problem, Chief, With this new person, it's like why they have to do that. I was just up there three days ago, and I was up there last month. And how come you didn't choose? You know, joy over there, you know, he's not doing anything, so rather than, you know, say it the same way and have them be mad at you being up there possibly angry, you know, causing danger to themselves. You might have to, like, give them a little bit more explanation about why it is what Joey is doing. Um, there's a time for that, you know, explain what joy is doing. Uh, but it would help them understand their role and their position in the unit with mawr. Explanation. Um, yeah, there's a wide range of people that you're gonna experience, and you just have to modify your tone toe account for it."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,When is it a good idea to share personal stories or emotions with members of your team?,"sometimes stories, air called for it. And sometimes, um, they're not One example could be. Let's say you had an outing. Uh, your younger Navy years where, um you wanted you wind up at some shady place that you weren't supposed to be at. Um, there is an officer in the corner, and you kind of like, slipped out of out of sight. Let's say it's past curfew or something, and you were there when you weren't supposed to be. Now, of course, that could make for a good story. You know, when your third class or second class. Um, But if you wanted to say the same story as a chief, then people might lose respect for you even though it happened. And even though it is something to explain, because it does happen a lot, you know, um, you don't wanna mention those types of stories to your subordinates because number one they think that your actions air right. Since then, you've learned that they're wrong. Since then, you would have changed. But you can't explain all of that to them. You're not going to say Yeah. I was speeding at 100 MPH on the I five, um, and smiling at it because, like, even though you say Well, you know, since then, I've slowed down. Since then, I have a family. They're not gonna listen to that. They're just gonna listen to the part where you were speeding and they can speed now, too. So there's a time and a place for everything. Um, if if it's a story that makes him smile and builds, report builds morale, then go ahead and throw that out there. If it's a story where you've changed your mind and you don't think that you have the tools necessary or at least amount of time necessary to explain that it was, uh it wasn't something that you're supposed to be doing, even though it might make for a great sea story. You should put that in your back pocket."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What counseling skills are important?,"The most important piece of counseling that you can hear is that you have to listen. There have been so many times that I've actually witnessed, um, counseling sessions that go on where the person that was giving the counseling was speaking a lot more than the person being counseled. Um, whenever I've seen it, I've I've kind of explained, you know, like, hey, you know what? Like it's a it's a listening session. You can give them the tools. Hey, they wanna be an officer. Fine. Give them the material. Hey, they want to win an award. Okay, tell them what it takes to get that award. But for the most part, counseling is kind of It is a back and forth session, but it's also an opportunity for the person being counseled. Toe let go of some of the things that were on their minds. Um, if it's for a positive award, um, let them explain things to you so that you can take material toe. Take notes on how you can help them get that award. If it's a behavioral counseling session, then let them explain their story to make sure that you have all information. So that You know that you're not mistreating them so that you have the full story, that, uh, so that so that they feel that they've been they've had their full story heard and that you can that the justice will be fair."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How do I work with my team to meet the standards? (if they are having trouble meeting them),"the best way that you could help your team meet standards. At least for me. It was to lead by example when it was for fitness. I made sure that I was always, um, pushing people clapping them on, you know, being one of the top performers of my physical fitness assessment. Whether it's for awards, I made sure that, like I have some awards myself, I know what it takes to get awards. Aiken, tell people if you wanna get sailor recorder, you need X, Y and Z let me help you. I've also done X Y Z Um, here's here's my my resume. Here's my recommendations. Um, go to some other people and get there is, you know, and give it to them. That's called leading by example when you have, ah, pristine example, or at least as close to what is possible. And then you filter that out to other people, um, for standards of, let's say, fixing some equipment, right? Um, if they don't know how to do it, then you lead by example. You are the one who goes down there and says, Hey, you know what you want through these things you bust out this tech manual and you you report to this person. Um, the worst thing that you could do is, uh, knowing that they don't know that they might not reach the standard. You still direct them from the office? It's like, Hey, go down there and and fix it. Once they come back with substandard work, you don't really have ah position Thio. Explain to them like, Hey, you know what? Like you were wrong in this case, if you weren't there or if you didn't show them what the right example was, then you're the one who is wrong."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How should you reward your sailors for good performance?,"as a leader, you should always take the time toe. You know, get your give your people some kind of credit for the work that they've done. And, um, the work that they can do can can can vary. It could be a Sfar as coming to work every on time, every single day to fixing the admiral's boat or something like that and everything in between. Um, for the smaller ones, just a little pat on the back, you know, nice job in front of people, you know, in the public environment, you know, it makes them feel good about themselves. You condone bump it up a little bit by saying, Hey, you know what? We have this day off. Um, do do all the work that you've been all the good work that you've been doing. Or here's a birthday cake or here's here's pizza. Um, something some kind of food that we don't usually eat, especially if you're out in port. Um, you can crank that up a little bit more. There are letters of commendation there, uh, Navy achievement medals now that you give for for a super quality work and the ultimate way that you can support your people is by number one giving them a stellar evaluation and and number two promoting them"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"What traits and experience, do you look for when interviewing new team members?","The first thing I look for is what is their level of knowledge? Can I give them a main inside them and then come back in 20 minutes and then it's complete? Um, that's kind of hard toe grass with the initial meeting. That's something that you kind of develop over the first couple of weeks. Third couple weeks. Um, the way that they communicate with you is the second is the second piece. Do they go off, do the main inside them, and then you don't see them for the rest of the day? Do they go off and then come back and update you every now and then? Uh, do they also say like, Hey, please give me another roll. Please give me a more intense role. Or are they saying, hey, you know what? Like, um, I just wanna stay over here in the corner. What's the least amount of work that I could do for this eight hour long day? Uh, if he assigns me the pump, I can go do the pump, and then at the end of the day, then if it's done, then I'm good there. Other people that say, Hey, you know, I finished the pump. You know, before lunch. Is there anything that you need after lunch? So the people that come to me with, you know, like additional responsibility requests Those are the ones that I I tryto, um, interact with the most."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How should your relationship be with the people in charge of you?,"for the people in charge. I want them to know that I'm dependable and that I'm independent. Those two things are, I think, the most important for the leaders above me and for me. When I'm looking at other people, I'm dependable, which means that I assigned a task. And even if there are some problems, those will be handled by him or lower. And he's just gonna come back to me with the final result. And the independent part is, um, that once I give him that responsibility, he takes it on, uh, as if it were his own child as and he's the supervisor then and and he just comes back to me with, ah, positive result."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What would you advise a person in this field to get to know their bosses?,"If you want to get to know your supervisor is a little bit better. I say the best thing that you could do is to be involved in whatever they're involved in. Maybe they're They have some kind of job that needs to be accomplished. And it's not your turn to do that job. Um, Well, because you're not involved in that work, you can kind of say like, hey, you know, like, what does it take to do what you're doing? Let me see, You know, be over their shoulder. Um, if they are in involved in some work, you know, you could be down there, you know, with another wrench saying, Hey, you know what? I'm here. Let me see how you operate. Um, when they are in when they are involved in your own in your work, then, um, that's a great opportunity for you. Toe. Collaborate with them. Um, sometimes you might not need him there, but say Hey, you know what? Can you please come down here? Just kind of oversee my work? Tell me what I'm doing wrong. Tell me what I'm doing. Right. Or how would you do this? This is what I do it, um what would you do in this case? They're gonna be many opportunities for that"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How do you handle supervisors who were unable or unwilling to give you feedback?,"So for supervisors who are unable or unwilling to get feedback, Well, let's do different camps. If a supervisor is unable to give feedback on your leadership, then that just means that you just get someone else. Um, they can't. For some reason, maybe they're too busy. Maybe they're not there at the time. Um, maybe that's not their specialty. For whatever reason, Uh, it's very important for you to always get feedback on the quality work that you're doing, so it just doesn't have to be from him. Um, there's someone above him that you can go to. There are other people that he worked that he works with, that you can go to them. And there's also your fellow compatriots. Like if someone has done that job before, even though they're not a supervisor, um, they could still give you quality feedback that you can use in your own career if they're unwilling to, uh, that could be a different type of problem. Um, for the Navy, I'm pretty sure that most supervisors that I've encountered are always willing to lend a hand and give you feedback. But if they're unable, if they're unwilling to them, that's, ah deeper problem that you might need toe bring up a little bit higher"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What encourages accountability?,"The thing that I found that encourages accountability is ownership. If there's some task that you assigned with, if you're doing someone else's task, then basically, uh, the credit will belong to that person if it gets completed. However, if they say, um, Chief Anderson, this is your job and, um, its success or failure depends on you, then that actually puts ownership in my corner. And that makes me more accountable, because I know that if it's unsuccessful, it's not gonna go to him. That's something that you always have to think about as a leader. Take on every task as if it's your own, and that way you always be accountable for it on Did you get the credit as well as the failures for it?"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What are ways you can identify the strengths and limitations for each member of your team?,"whenever you have a new crew or maybe a crew that's doing things that they're not used to assign them the smaller tasks. You know what? Hey, um, go up and tell the CEO this comes back, Um, when? A few seconds with a fully detailed information. Then, um, thing, they're good. If they're failing on the small, tiny tasks, Then as you grow up as as their responsibility grows, you're gonna find that you might They might not be as dependable as other people. So, um, yeah, just sign them task and keep a mental record of their successes and failures in those tasks. Obviously the ones who are superstars, you just let them go. The ones who are kind of failing in that area, you kind of like give them feedback on how they can improve"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What is the best way to develop ones' skills in working in and with teams?,"the best way to develop your skills when you're working with teams is to number one kind of get to know them. Um, what's an interesting situation is when you go into a table and you're not familiar with any of the faces that around, um, people say things that because you don't know them personally, it's just a statement, Um, that they say, And you, you don't put it in the context of the type of person that that is, uh, for instance, somebody should somebody could say, Hey, you know what we need to have, you know, all of electrical division. Go down, um, and sit around the determine generator and make sure until it's fixed. If you didn't know that, that person meant that, Hey, you know, it's like, uh, it's a department wide thing and he's not saying every single person cool down there. You could think that he's a jerk. Um, otherwise, you could Let's say he's a really strong character, strong leader, and he really does mean hey really doesn't want people to go down there, every single one of them, right? If you didn't know that he has a long history of being successful that is really respected in his unit by his department, then you also you might think he's a jerk. But if you know where people stand and why they're saying the things that they that they say, you can really respect the team a lot more."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How is it different to manage military people vs. civilians in the military?,"generally, What I found is that it's so much more easy. Thio Thio. Have military members do the things that you want than civilians? I think that there's a long there's there a lot of reasons for this number one because you're directly in charge off the military persons progression. Um, maybe you're not directly in charge, but you can control it. All you have to do is just tell is Chief. That's kind of like telling the mom or the dad of some kid versus a civilian, and that's more like dealing with a stranger. Number one. You have no idea who is boss is. If you do, maybe they're kind of separated. Uh, even if you did know him like because they're under government obligations, um, they can't really chastised the person under them the same way that a person in the military could. So it z not night and day, but because you're more involved in the leadership structure of the military person and you can affect them. Ah, lot more. They tend to listen more, and they tend to be more. We're willing to fight for one team rather than, uh at the job site just because it's a part of their their their job"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What makes the navy different than other branches of the military?,"I think the Navy is pretty unique because, unlike other other branches, for instance, I'm thinking of the Army, the Marines and Air Force. I'm not very familiar with them, but from what I've kind of seen is, I'm thinking of Let's say, March Air Force Base. I see lots of buildings all around, and I'm assuming that there's a floor for a department and there's, Ah, third floor for another department, and I bet that they don't interact as much. And I bet that that building that squadron doesn't interact as much with the squadron to squadron to the right. Compare that with the Navy when you take all of those buildings and all of those floors and stack them on top of each other. And now you have an aircraft carrier which has electrical division, mechanical division, the cooks, the boatswain's mates, and you always hear what everyone's doing all the time. This is the one EMC we'd like to think electrical division for fixing the mass. This is, uh, we'd like to thank the cooks for providing a good meal to everyone. We'd like to thank the boatswain's mates for guiding us through this treacherous territory. Um, we're all in this. We're all doing general quarters together. That means everyone has, um, firefighting pack on. And we're all seeing each other, talking to each other, seeing each other in the hallways, playing cards with each other during during galley mills. Um, you have a lot more interaction with the whole entire structure rather than being so split up. So I think that that navy it builds it builds community within your work center within your department within the entire ship. And I don't think that other military branches have that as much."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Describe an experience that illuminates (Navy) culture.,"for me when I'm thinking about stories that I've had, That kind of says, Hey, you know what? I am in the Navy. Everyone knows I'm in the Navy. I feel like I'm in the Navy. Um, they all have to deal with port calls. Uh, I remember being in Australia, and we we've first we pull in and I'm telling you, there was a line of people outside the gates and as soon as you walk, walk out, you know, like, uh maybe people start talking to you. You get to your first bar and, you know, you get these looks from people, you know, you get random people sit down beside you is like, Hey, ah, you want a beer? Let let me get this guy a beer. You know, like, what's life been like for you for the last couple of months? You get those stories all the time, Um, you goto gambling halls and you see, like people just like letting off steam, you know, drinking and talking and chatting. And, um, you know, and and their many celebrities for a while, for at least you know, for days of their life they are the stars of the show, and I think that that really is the is the role that I see the Navy has played for me for, um, being really exciting."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"How do you help morale? (e.g., when the crew was supposed to go home but needs to stay active/at sea?)","This is one one item of concern that really affect all work centers. Um, especially when you've been out there for see when people know each other and for for a long time. And, uh, you really talked about a lot of things. Um, there's not really much you can say to kind of increase the morale except for talking about the goals about the future. About like, um, once you're gonna pull in, What's gonna happen? Um, generally, you try to keep things light. You try to keep things fun. Um, but it's it's really hard. Thio do when, uh, they've already had that that fun exciting, you know, goal oriented thing the first month of deployment. What about the third month? What about the fifth month? Right. So in that case, uh, it's one of the goals of leader toe tryto get their hopes up any way possible. I found that, you know, like, food is a really big motive. Uh, incentivize er motivator. Um, maybe time off is another one thes air. Things that you know are beyond words. You actually give them something physical tangible that they can actually say. Yeah, you know, let's get our hopes up. Let's get our let's keep our hopes alive. And, um, they're gonna be lots of times that what? You have to work all day and you're gonna be like that for the whole entire week. Um, of course, you gotta talk about what's gonna happen afterwards, but during in the middle of it on the second day, that is happening on the third day, that's happening. Like I said, just keep it light and hope for the best."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Who are the core team members (inner circle) who you relied on as a leader?,"the core team members that I found. And this is from the time that your third class all the way up to master chiefs that I've seen are the first class and the chief. That pairing combined is the backbone of the Navy. The lPO, it's his role as ah, as a chief in making is to talk to the whole entire unit, and the chief is the one that Davies out that information to the officers above, and he gets all the requirements. What? There's the things that they're supposed to do. And it's kind of like an hour glass. And the chief is the thing on the top. The sand at the top in the lpo is the sand at the bottom, you know, going going down. And that structure is so crucial. Um, where if you didn't have that, let's say you had a week chief or weak lpo. Um, then, um, yeah, it's all downhill. Downhill from there"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"If you have trouble listening well, what strategies can help you listen well?","if I had a problem listening, Let's say they were so uncomplaining. And we have a chat, and, um, he still has the same complaints. That might be an indication that I'm not listening to him. Well, um, I tried myself, obviously. You know, he came to me, and we still didn't have some kind of communication quality communication. So in that case, I know when Thio gather help I might for our next counseling session or if one is needed, I might have a someone else come in. Say, Hey, you know what? Um, give me some perspective on the conversation that me and this other person are having. Am I wrong? It made. Maybe I'm, um, listening the wrong way. Or maybe I'm talking too much. Maybe he's too angry as a third party. You can actually feel that out and tell us where both of us are going wrong."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What is your name?,My name is Clinton Anderson.
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What year were you born?,I was born in 1979.
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How old are you now?,I'm 41 years old.
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Where did you grow up?,"I grew up in Los Angeles, California."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Tell me about your childhood.,"I grew up in a few different places. I lived with my grandmother in Alabama. I lived with my other grandmother in Michigan, and when I was in high school, I was in Los Angeles, California. So after being in California, then I joined the Navy, and after that time I was just adult and lived in all across the world. But Alabama, Michigan in Los Angeles. So the three main places I grew up in."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Tell me about your family growing up.,"my parents split up when I was too young to recall. I grew up mostly with my mom and a little bit with my dad, then a little bit with my mother's mom and then a little bit with my father's mom. And then we just saw Swap back and forth, so I never stayed in the same place for more than two years. I think this popping around from place to place got me, um, really excited toe move to different places all the time. I know a lot of people try to stay in one spot in same school with the same families, but for me, I just like to travel a lot, so that's, uh, how my childhood was."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"When you were a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up?","when I was when I was a kid. I want Thio do something completely different than what I'm doing right now. I remember my grandmother had this piano that I used to play, and after my keys, my hands went on the keys and I started listening to music. I knew I was gonna at least give it being a musician, a shot. And then I used to live with my mother and she used to draw all the time. And so, after drawing my first few cricketers, I said, You know what? I'm an artist. And I think that really stuck with me the whole entire time that I was a kid when I was in middle school, I used to live in Germany and, uh, I was going to a German school and I didn't speak German at all. And then, um, we had to learn French while I was in Germany. So I was learning French in German, and I was translating the both at home so that I knew I was gonna be, um, an international relations this guy. But none of that worked out. Eventually, I became an electrician's an engineer, and right now I'm a computer science scientists. So"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What kind of student were you?,"when I was really young, I was a really good student. I did all my homework. I was basically straight a student up until I got into high school. Um, after I joined high school, I didn't really have a good relationship with my father. So I kind of fell off the fill out the loop. I think, Ah, freshman, my freshman scores was like a 3.8. Then my sophomore year. It was like a 3.5. And then it just like, uh after I moved from Michigan to California and I didn't know anyone and, you know, like, that's when I started with my dad. I just like, never wants to stay home. So it just fell off the off the rails eso. After I joined the Navy, I started becoming a much better student. We joined the Nuclear Propulsion School, and they really, uh, intensely grill you every single day, so that then I shot back up to being a perfect student. At that time,"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What was your home life like?,"my home life was very varied. You could say, um, I grew up with so many different people with my grandmother from my mother's side and my grandmother from my father's side, and my mom and my dad and I would split those four places all over the place. Um, sometimes in Alabama, which was, um, all black, which it was in an all black community. Um, e didn't really get along with the kids. You can tell that my speech is very, very proper. And there they have ah, very Southern, um, southern heritage. And it kind of clashed. I didn't make fun of a lot. Um, maybe where you from? You know, you don't speak like us. So, um, the regular building that everybody gets, um, moving up to Michigan. I stayed with my my mother, and, uh, that was mawr. That was more of an urban feel to it, but they we didn't grow up very rich at that time. You know, there were mice in their home. There was, um, drugs. I remember, you know, prostitutes in the house. So I didn't really try to stay home so much, but I really had a good relationship with my mom and my sister, who cared for me a lot. Um, later on around high school, high school time I lived, started living with my father, and it was just him. He didn't really, uh, care too much for me at the time. He had two jobs, and I could tell he was overworked. Um, so basically, I stayed at my school and I stayed around. My friends, uh, that led to us not having a really good relationship. So I moved out of the house when I was 18. So my my childhood was pretty interesting, to say the least."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,When did you start with the Navy?,"I joined the Navy in 2000. That was a couple years right after high school. I graduated 1997 and, um, I went to boot camp in 2000."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What is your current position now?,"right now, I'm a master student at the Naval Postgraduate School studying cybersecurity for the Navy Reserve. I'm a chief in the Los Angeles Operational Support Unit."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What was your major leadership role?,"through the Navy. You get a lot of leadership opportunity ever since you joined. So you can be tutoring somebody you can actually be in charge of. Ah, a small group of cleaners and painters. Um, as you progress through the ranks of being a petty officer, um, those experiences grow more and more. So I think it really complicated in my whole experience when I became the training petty officer as a first class, um, for the Navy Reserve, that was the, uh that's after eight years of being in the Navy Reserve. Then I switched over to being a civilian. And then, um, during that first position, I was actually in charge of training 35 people on, um, how they learned what things were learning and whether they're keeping up, Um, and on track."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How do you spend most of your time at work?,"Right now, I'm in a pretty intense program at the post graduate school studying cybersecurity. We take four classes and, um, I'm reading entire textbooks for each of my classes. It's ah, pretty, pretty intense from the time you wake up until about eight o'clock or so. Then I come home and I play video games and you know about some YouTube. But before this, uh, when I wasn't in school, I was the senior enlisted adviser for the Navy Reserve back in Japan, and I was working a kind of a federal job. I was being achieved for one of the one of the ships out there, um, just overlooking what the contractors were doing. But that actually gave me a lot of time. And during that free time actually spent a lot of time working for the Navy Reserve, which is also looked at about 50 other sailors from the top to the bottom of Japan. Um, they all have their own lives, and I have to keep all of them on track about what they're doing for the nature reserve, whether they're going on their eighties, whether they're conducting a lot of their training. So I had two jobs in one a time, so that was also a pretty intense work as well"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Describe the work you did on a typical day.,"here at the post graduate school. We have four classes and each class last about an hour or two between each class. There's, you know, like a little brick. So, um, for the most part, for the for up until noon, you just sit there and listen and you absorb the material after that, then you're pretty much free. But there's no way that you can skip a day without, like studying something, so you take one or maybe two classes, and you really focus on them. You read a chapter or two or you do some homework."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Describe the physical environments in which you've worked.,"from for the Navy. I've had lots of different types of work. I I never just stood in a desk, and I've never been in the plants all day. I've gotten an opportunity to, um, be up in the stan Shins and fixing lights painting. I've been in the nuclear reactor room, you know, like, um, overseeing maintenance that was going on by contractors, Um, as a senior enlisted adviser And what you grew up in the ranks. Then you you start to do actual work less and less, and it switches over toe overseeing work more and more. So, for the most part, I, um, at least for the neighbor reserves as a senior enlisted adviser, I get the information from my first class is about, um How the units going where they're going, Um, how they are on the training. Um, I help them out with their evils. I tell them what to do. Which chapters to look at, um, things like that. Um, when I grew up when I was going through the navy as an electrician's made, I spent a lot of time in the plants that's picking up a song hammer and way. Don't use saws and hammers, but way use our volt meters. We use our resistors. We use our screwdrivers and wrenches opening up panels, Um, checking them, cleaning them, um, doing preventive maintenance on them, Um, oiling them up, things like that."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How many hours do you work in a typical week?,"in the Navy. You generally work Ah lot, especially if you're on deployment. Um, Sunday's would be your easiest day, and that day would be a six hour watch. And that's a lucky day for the rest of the time. You you wake up a 6 50 maybe a little bit earlier, if you wanna shower. If you had the night before you're down in the plants the whole entire day up until 1600 off course, their breaks for lunch, you could go outside and smoke. Um, okay, there. Maybe sometimes that you could take an hour to go to the top of ship to vultures role. They're not pushing you so hard, but they do expect you to be working. You know, the whole ship is working, so it's like a community. Um, where nukes differ from other sailors is that we're expected toe also stand watch outside of our normal, um, our normal workday, which means that we have a five hour watch here or six hour watch there could be in the middle of the night. Could be at night time. There's also general quarters, especially when we're at war time. And we have general quarters every single day. That's two hours, so yeah, you will be worked a lot. Um, and you be proud of it, too. Um, every four days you were up for 24 hours, and then you get your rest and, you know, as a nice young guy, it's good. Outside of the six years that I worked on the aircraft care, Um, just being in the Navy reserves or I think normal people in the active duty, they tend to have 40 hour weeks, which are seven toe, 1500 standard."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What kinds of decisions do you make in your career on a daily basis?,"the types of decisions that I usually make, Um, tend to be standard. Um, What type of training are you doing? Are you doing it? Well, um, if you don't have some information for something Well, this is the resource. Let me help you find the resource every now and then. You know, actually, a pretty often you're faced with decisions concerning people's careers, and that's when your job gets really interesting. So somebody comes and says they want to join an officer program. And that's when you really have to, like, let the light shine on them. You have tow, figure out how to get them in a ward. How toe modify the wards so that it makes shines them in the best light. How to make sure that their evaluation looks spot on how to make sure that they don't have any problems in their old evaluations. So those for those times that's when your stress level is a little bit higher because you know that you're dealing with someone else's career. So you have, um, situation like that pretty often as a chief"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What kinds of problems do you deal with?,"the biggest type of problem that I deal with our behavioral problems in the Navy. You have such a wide variety of people. You have people from down south. You have New Yorkers. You have people that have a slight racist twinge that you try toe, you know, modify and say, Hey, you know what this is? We don't work that way. Here, let me help you. Um, you have some people that are go getters and superstars that, um, should are gonna go all the way up to see, you know, if you let them, um yeah, all the ah wide range of people that you have to, um You have to get them to feel that the way, the way that Navy feels the best way I can say this is that somewhere in the middle of boot camp, um, there's a first class out there he was explaining to all of us. You know what he pointed to the whole entire room. You know, we don't know where you've been. We don't know where we've come from. Some of you have had a hard life. Some of you have had some of you have had an easy life. Um, but no matter what, you all your own navy right now, and we have to make sure that you I understand those core values honor, courage and commitment, uh, in whatever you do. So my job is a chief is to make sure that everything that comes from all of my sailors, um, attribute those values."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What is a story that really shows what it is like working in your job?,"my job has had a lot off ups and downs adventures. You can call them a lot of port calls. Those are the things that I remember most about to be in the Navy, but assed faras like usefulness. I can just think of one story on my last ship What I was doing an annual training was on the USS Blue Ridge. That's one of the main ships, one of the command and control ships that the Navy has and we're going through Answer. Which is this very, very strenuous big test. Uh, that looks at all of the departments of the ship. Make sure that we're fit for seat. Um, I was an electrician's that was called out there because there wasn't a chief in the unit. So, uh, electrical department had some problems that needed to be corrected while I was there. And so there was a big light that was shining on us. So it is our job toe, you know, like make sure that everybody was was doing the best job that they could. There's this one light pole that had some problems, and we have this first class that, um, like he put on his fall safety gear. Me, too. We went up the ladder. It was really dangerous up there. You know, like, you just take one move left and right, you know, or you don't put the hook on, and then your life's at risk. Um, he he was out there for hours, maybe four hours, five hours trying to troubleshoot. Um, thats one, um, this run transistor that wasn't working. Um, I went down, Um, maybe since someone else else up there. He stayed up there for hours and hours even longer. The whole day. It was nighttime by the time he got down, Um, that one problem that he fixed, uh, it was like it was amazing. I tried to put him in for an award for it. Um, but that that's one job that I think, uh, really stands out in my mind from last year that I was really proud to be a part of and, yeah, it is great."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What are the major benefits of doing this kind of work?,"for me, one of the main benefits that I found from being the Navy comes from. I mean, I walk down the street and I get so much respect for being a veteran for serving the country and considering what I've done and what I've seen other people in my in my rate and in my, um, service do I think that is justified as a civilian? I so most right. I've been a student this whole entire time, and I have done some jobs. I've worked for the for NASA. I've worked for Institute for Creative Technologies at USC. I've done I've seen what software engineers do, and, um, they get a lot of pay for, um, strenuous work, no doubt. But there's no comparison for getting maybe paid half what? Your half. What your civilian counterparts get but doing ah lot more work for and most people in Navy don't Don't consider this. You could get paid more as you go askew. Go further in your career. But, um, most people in the Navy don't do this fourth salary. We do it for the type of work that we're doing, which is hard, strenuous. You know, young person you know, bottle physic, physical work. Um, that's serving the country. So I think that that's one of the main benefits that I got the fact the private get from being able to be one of the few people who can do that."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What are the major negatives of doing this kind of work?,"the Navy just like anyplace else. Eyes full of people with lots of different ideas. And, um, some people want to do it way the other people want to do it way be. And of course, you're gonna have some dissension. Um, I guess we we call it politics, you know, And politics is everywhere. For the most part, it's just like anyplace else. If you've been through high school, then you know exactly what I'm talking about. But it's revved up a little bit more here because, um, people's salaries are on the lines. People's day to day activities are on lines. Um, you could get fired for certain things. Um, if your gun decking, for instance, you can you can actually go to jail. So there There are a lot of a lot of reasons that the interaction between people can get in the way of actually just doing your job. And that's one of the things that chiefs actually have toe after mitigate"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How much travel do you do in a year?,"when you're in the regular Navy active duty service, then you're not expected to travel too much except for when you're on deployment. Now that I'm in the Navy reserves, they expect me to actually go outside of my, um, my command every single year. So we have these things called annual trainings and being in the surge main unit, we actually go toe five different places. We could go toe Hawaii or Norfolk or New Hampshire, Japan, Um, and, uh, other small places as well. So for the most part, they really want you to go toe one place so you can know the people and get to know your job Well, but as the chief, I decided to go toe all of those places because, hey, why not? You know, it's not gonna hurt anything. And I don't actually want to know where my people are and what they're doing, eh? So that gives me an opportunity to say I know what all these shipyards are like. I know exactly where you're going, and I know those people. So, um, I've had a chance to travel a lot in the Navy reserves"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Why do you love your job?,"When I first joined the Navy, they were trying to promote the Nuclear Propulsion School and they threw a lot of things on my desk. We'll we'll give you lots of money for school, which they did, and I've I've sucked it all up after you get out of Navy, then you can have $100,000 your job. And being a kid that was currently working at McDonald's, that sounded great. You know, like, uh, now I can have that $100,000 your job. No problem. Um, they said, Oh, you know, you become a veteran and you go to the Post Graduate School and they provide a lot of different things. But to tell you the truth, all of those kind of sift into the back to the background. Um, I'm still the name of this at this time, and I didn't become a nuclear, um, operator. At the end, however, I did get the challenge that they were talking about. That's the thing that really drove me tojoin the nuclear propulsion school. And that's the thing that I think I got the most out of. I was challenged more than I ever had been in my life, and that's something that you can't put a price on And that that's a job that I don't think that most of the other jobs that I saw the Navy wouldn't provide as much as, um, after getting out of the active duty service, I was a chief. And, of course, I love, you know, providing opportunities for people and helping them promote their career, You know, like all chiefs will say that. But what I personally like for myself about being, um, still in the Navy reserves is to travel. I did a lot of port calls when I was in active duty. And I'm telling you, I went to 13 different countries. Uh, Dubai, Bahrain. Kuwait, um, Japan, You know, dozens of places, but being in the reserve, you actually go to these places. They give you a car, they give you a hotel. Uh, they give you a decent work, they give you money in your pocket and on the weekends you can explore. So I've seen New York and the capital and, um, New Hampshire, places that I didn't think that I would go for a long time. I've seen Washington and you know, swimming the beaches of Hawaii, and they say that I'm working. That's that's incredible because I think that it's kind of like a or work vacation."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What gets romanticized about your career field that really isn't that great?,"being in the military is kind of like what it depicts on the TV for a lot in a lot of aspects. So, for instance, um, there's the Brotherhood. Uh, that's absolutely true. Uh, there's, ah, stable paycheck. That's also right there is exploring different parts of the country that all of that is absolutely true. And you'll check all those boxes. Um, What I have found that the preconception that I had coming in that hasn't been true is, um Well, I want to say the fitness, we're all kind of fit, and I think we're generally more fit than the rest of society. However, I thought like you'd be big and strong and, you know, exercising every day. And, um, that's not quite true. In the Navy, at least it might be for the Army or the Marines or other services. But for the Navy, um, generally, you're stationed on an aircraft care and there are tons of electric of exercise equipment, no doubt, and you can go at five o'clock in the morning and you can see it's full. They also give you lots of Jim facilities that people go through all the time. I was in the basketball court almost everyday. However, um, it's generally not so required that you're exercising, um, with everybody at the whole time. My dad was in the Army and I actually saw his whole crew like running around the building, run around the camps and things, So I thought I'd have a similar experience with the Navy. But that's actually not true. Generally your physical fitness is more your own thing, and you could just get tested on it a lot."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What are some of the common misconceptions about your field?,"One of the misconceptions that I had going in was being labeled an electrician's mate. And even though I dealt with a lot of electrical things, you know, I was a mate for Electrician's, um, generally the first six months that you that you're in the new power school deals with, like teaching about electrician's and about electrical things. Electrical equipment. However, once you become a new electrical operator, you deal less with fixing things. Um, there's a caveat to that. If you go on a submarine, then they don't have regular electrician's. There are only nukes Nuke Electrician's. So then you're you're fixing laundry machines and changing lights and, uh, changing out pumps. And you know, there's there's only so many people on that ship. So you're expected to do everything, however, on an aircraft care, which is where I was, um, other electrician's. They take care of everything above the plants below the plants. There aren't that many, um, really complicated electrical things that you have to fix. Our goal was just toe maintain things. So there's a turbine generator. You take off everything, you dust it off, you increase it up and you put it back. If there is something broken. Oh, yeah, You know, the they tend toe pull in and they take off the whole entire machine and put a whole new contraption on it. So I I didn't get so much of fixing things, but I did become a much better operator. That's the difference that that I found being a nuclear electrician's mate."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What do you do now that is different from what you thought you would be doing?,"some things that I'm doing right now that I never thought that I would be doing, um, you can take the last place that I was on the USS Blue Ridge now being ah, nuclear electrician's mate. I was basically in the plants for the most time, for the most part, and, you know, kind of supervising down there. And I hadn't done that for about eight years. So I thought, Well, once I joined the reserves, Well, that's gonna be one of last times that I'm actually dealing with, like, controlling what gets fixed and how it gets fixed. But yeah, I just recently on the USS Blue Ridge, I found myself even as reserve chief, overseeing a group of 15 electrician's, and we actually were in charge of fixing the whole entire ship from the bottom of the hole all the way to the top. Massive antenna. Um, I was in the radar room. I was in the navigation room. I was up on Vulture's row. I was dealing with how to fix the didn't fix the helicopters, but how to do the electrical checks on the helicopters. These are things that I never thought that I would be, um, uh, that I would have to deal with. But, um, the Navy Reserve actually gives you an opportunity to deal with things that you that air new. As long as you have some of the prior leadership qualities. And as long as you know some basics about it. Electricity deal with electricity things, then, um then they could put you anywhere."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How did your work day change over your career?,"As I progressed through my career, I found that I work slightly more and more. So I began probably with around like, nine or 10 hour workdays, and they every about every five years, it grows about one one more hour with each solid workday. So, for instance, now, um, for a normal workday, I could work, like maybe 12 or 13 hours. Whereas when I started, it was like, nine. But, um, what's more important is the type of work that you do. So when you first come in, um, you just told what to do is like, Hey, you know what? Like we have toe get this pump changed out, Um, get the grapples and, you know, take it out. Um, five years later, you're a part of the cruise like, Hey, you take those four people for people and you go and take that pump out five years after that, Uh, then you're the person that tells that one person to go do it, and you're actually not at the scene. Sometimes you're not at the scene on Ben. They just tell you Hey, we just did it. Um, you still have the same amount of work because there's a lot of paperwork that goes along with it. But you can see that as you as you progress. It goes from working with your hands toe, working with your mind on working with the pin."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"Where did you have to move in your career, and how did that change things each time?","when I was in active service. Um, you start off at South South Carolina. We were going to school, and basically I had no responsibilities. Just learn. Once I was at prototype in New York. Um, then you actually, like dealing with moving switches and turning knobs and trying to understand things, trying to change things. Um, after that, we went toe USS John C. Stennis, and that's when you became an operator, but a new entry level operator. Um, by the time I left there, after three years, I was a senior level operator, and I was actually, um, doing lpo responsibilities for the rest of the rest of the crew. So you can see that basically, with each new city, I had a new level of responsibility and just turned out that way. It doesn't have to be that way, but for me, um, when I finally left after eight years of service and I, um, became ah, Naval Reservist, I was in the position toe to be a first class and a chief at that time, and my whole entire experience had kind of been leading up to that point"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Where do you see yourself in 5 years? 10?,"after being in the Navy for so long as a chief, I think one of the things I'm trying to work on is become a an officer through the direct commissioning officer program. If that doesn't work out, then there are other opportunities for me. As a chief, I could be a chief warrant officer. Or I could continue my, uh, enlisted career as senior chief. Or, you know, with the goal of eventually becoming a master chief for the civilian side. Um ah Ah, cyber security analyst. I'm going to school for computer science, and I'm hoping that that degree will lead me to a federal job. Um, maybe working for NASA may be working for a federal research lab or maybe someplace in Japan, which is, uh, one place that I'm really eager to get back to."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Are you married?,"currently. I'm not married. That doesn't mean I'm not looking. I got married pretty young. I think I was 24 or something like that. And e got married for the same reason that everybody else does. Um, my wife was, uh, model in my eyes. You know, she loved me a lot. I was really good friends with her family, and I thought that that was a good reason to get married. However, um, I think the only reason that you should be married is you have someone who's supportive of you, and you expect to grow old with them. And I don't think that that was, uh, the reason that I got married. We were married for eight years and we broke up a lot. We, uh we were separated a lot. I think we got married. And then pretty soon after that, I I went on deployment. By the time it came back from deployment, we were already separated. We got back together. Um, but then, of course, I go to another state, and her kids were in school in California. I was in Washington, Um, another separation once I got out of the navy, Um, then I finally came back to California and we tried again. And that's when our personalities, uh, really living with each other. You find out that, you know, like, um, maybe two people. I need more time to grow together instead of just, uh, delving into the relationship. You need to become a boyfriend and girlfriend first and way had to tackle some of that. We tried again after I was started going to college. You know, that's ah, house with three bedrooms and, um, trying to get her a job and then you start toe, see that it's being married is one of the most important decision that you make in your life. And I think I would have benefit benefited from thinking about who I was getting together with."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Do you have any kids?,"I don't have any kids. I was a step dad for a while. My wife had three kids of her own, and I was the best father. I could be to them, but I don't have any of my own."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Do you have siblings?,I have a brother and a sister. They're both on the East Coast.
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Do you have any pets?,"recently I came to Monterrey and I'm going to school here. So I'm actually living in a really nice house in a seaside California, really close to my school. And there's a little cat that's running around. Her name is Momo, and she's really, uh, really puts, um, umph into my life gives me some kind of support."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Do you have a significant other?,"currently, there is no girlfriend in my life. Uh, during this time, I'm on dating sites all the time. And, yeah, you talk to someone for a few months or weeks or days, but they kind of fizzle out."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How much free time do you have in your career?,"being a student here at the Naval Postgraduate School. They tend to work you a lot. Um, maybe about four hours, at least per day for lectures. And then you're gonna have about two hours mawr of homework. Now, if you cut it off at that time, then you're your grades. They tend to be pretty generous with grades, but you don't. You're not gonna learn as much as you could have if you like, double that amount of time. So if you are working about 12 hours per day, which I think some days are, then that gives you about, like, four or five hours per day toe, um, kind of do your own thing. Your weekends are always free."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How often do you ever take work home with you?,"one of the problems that I found when I was doing undergrad is that I'd always, um, study. And then as soon as word got out or school got out, then I immediately go home and try to do my homework there. Sometimes you would find in the library sometimes you'd see me hanging out in groups and and with friends. But for the most part, I tried to do work at home. Um, I learned a lot, but I found it Mawr productive to do things. Um, the way that I did it in the Navy when I was going through the nuclear nuclear propulsion school. Um, there you're not allowed to take any books home with you. You have your dormitory, but because the books are confidential, you tend a study while you're there and because we didn't have ah, access toe laptops there, um, it was straight studying You just open your book and you read and you do your homework and there's nothing else you take a snack or something like that. So I'm trying to get back to that. So even though now I, um, I am allowed to bring the books home at the Naval Postgraduate School. I tend to stay there until the library closes it at 8 p.m. And then I come home. And then at that point that I'm free. Then I try not to study it all."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Does being a leader give you flexibility to alter your work schedule?,"when you're a leader. That's one of the best things about being in a supervisory position all the way up until your second class. You have someone telling you where to do, where to go, what to do, who to do it with. But when your leader, You have so much flexibility, you actually work Mawr, I think, as a leader. But the point is, you can alter your schedule as much as you want. You can not show up some days if you want. If you feel like, um, some other thing needs your need, your attention, you can actually just other people's schedule under you. If you want Friday off, that's you go into the commanding officer saying, Hey, you know what? Like uh, give us some free time here, and if you think that we should come on Saturday and Sunday, I did that pretty often on my last ship. You say, Hey, you know what? We're doing this in serve. We need you guys toe, you know, bear down and coming on the weekend"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"How does being a leader change your lifestyle? (frequent travel, irregular hours, family difficulties etc.)","I think I changed my life. Ah, lot. Ever since becoming a supervisor, I remember being a second class, um, getting done with the work. And you want the work to be done as quickly as possible because, you know that, um, soon you get done. That means that, like, come 1600 they're gonna let you off at that exact time. If you're ever, um, if your job ever needs a longer amount of time, then you know you're gonna just stay there longer, so it's better to get it done quicker than later. Um, as a supervisor, though, like, things are slightly different. Of course, you want the work to be done, uh, immediately, but you see everything that's on your plate so you actually want to do to be most efficient with your time."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How do your command responsibilities affect your style in personal life?,"being a leader really affected my life. You know, a lot of different ways. I remember being a second class. I would really want to finish the work immediately. And then once I get home and I just leave my work at home, uh, I'm playing video games. I'm watching Netflix. I'm watching movies, and I don't think about work again until I come back. However, when you're a leader, um, I tryto leave work at home. Um, I try to leave were at work as much as possible, but I do find that I think about it a lot at home. That's when you're making spreadsheets for the people. That's when you're emailing other chiefs. That's when you're talking about like, what's gonna happen the next day? Um, at 8 p.m. Or nine pm with with other leaders, other officers so it can affect you throughout the whole entire day. Um, once you become a leader"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What is a good approach for selecting a new duty station in terms of finding an area for my family to live in?,"where you live is really going to affect your approach to the job. I know some people who were station, um, nothing against Livermore. But they said Livermore, and it just wasn't the place for them. They said they hated it. And I can understand if the location doesn't have all the resources that you're expecting. A roller skating rink. Ah, good school. Ah, ah, Lake. If you feel like going into the ocean, um, the temperature that you're expecting, all those things can really affect affect you outside of work as well as inside. And so in general, you're not able to choose where you go. Um, it all depends on, you know, your family structure and how happy you are, toe Just live in a new place. But yeah, it can really affect your performance. Really affect your family. Who hasn't, you know, nothing to do with the military s. So you want to take those things into account"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What are the things I should prioritize when picking housing?,"as a mostly single guy. I've always been satisfied with any place that I've ever lived. When I was on active duty, um, you could find me, like, just living on on a basic bunk, and that was good enough for me. Eventually buy houses. And, um, yeah, there were five bedroom, 3000 square feet, house houses, But yeah, I just found myself just living in the living room. Um, so yeah, any place has been good enough for me, but from what I've seen from people who have been traveling around with your family Yeah, if you have three kids, then you wanna at least a three bedroom house. If you have dogs and cats, then you want at least backyard. Um, some people actually don't stay on the military housing because its's not quite what they're looking for, and they stay off base. But it depends on your command, whether they allow something like that or not."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What options do you have to transfer or change if you or your family needs it?,"personally, I haven't really needed toe change where I'm living that much. I've never been really sick. I've never had, um, some something wrong with my bones or anything like that. But from what I've seen, the Navy is really good about giving people the right tools to use if something happens with themselves or their family. If something's wrong with you, then they get you off the ship because it's a pretty harsh environment toe work in. If something's wrong with your family, then they tend to give you all the resource is that they need toe. Either get transferred back to the states if they're overseas or get transferred to the crack hospital if, um, if they need that."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"What impact will a hardship tour have on your friends or family, and what advice would one offer?","difficult assignments can come in many forms. One could be, um you get stationed to Africa for an entire year. Another could be. You could stationed, um, to a war zone. Um, you can come back with PTSD. Uh, you could come back with a riel angst with from four other people. You know, maybe you had a bad crew that you were working with, Or maybe, um, you were always on edge because of being in that war zone. So all of these things, the navy is really good about informing you what could happen. And they actually talk to your family before you leave to give them kind of a heads up about what you could be experiencing. The most important thing is that you have communication with your family while you're gone, or while you're in that difficult, difficult time. If they have some kind of communication with you, they can see how you're changing. And then they can either tell your command or you can give them some kind of. So you could give them some kind of support from wherever you are, so that they could go through it a little bit better"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How early should I get my family involved in the process of planning my next career step?,"I would say whatever you know should be immediately transferred to your family. Um, you might be going to another place and your kids might be going to another school. It's good to let them know so that they can start making their goodbyes to their friends. Um, if you're unsure of where you're going to be going, then it's just a heads up. If you're sure of where you're going to be going, then that's the sooner you You know, that, um, the better it is to start writing the documents to start changing jobs, uh, to start getting in contact with the people that you will be meeting with once you're there. So it could be a nice, smooth transition."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What has been your favorite place to live? Why?,"my most favorite place to live occurred when I was a kid. I was, um, in the military at the time, But my father was he was in the Army. I think he was in the six at the time, but at that time were staying on an American base and life was great for me. I didn't grow up rich. I had very few things, but he had a decent salary and could provide me with something. For every single holiday. All of my friends were, uh we're in a similar position. Um, that that I had They had parents that were officers or high level, um, enlisted people. And we had lots of toys to choose from. We're all together playing, playing in the sand lot. Um, using, you know, like a fake guns. And the roller skating rink was 25 cents. I think all the food at the commissary was super cheap. Eso chief, that you could buy, like, tons and tons of food with a $5. Uh, the $5 allowance that you've got comic books were, you know, like, I guess tax free. Everything about the military base was annoyed. Idealize, uh, society. So, um, that's one of the reasons that I joined, um, later on in in in my career"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What is an example of a conflict you had between your career and family life? How did you learn from it?,"The biggest conflict that I experienced myself was just the distance at the time, we didn't really used laptop so much. Um, around the 2000 to 2005 frame, Um, I just barely had my first laptop, and I think we had a well at the time. So we didn't have all the tools like Skype and Facebook that we have right now. And I think people are still using letters at that time. So, um ah, large, large part of my military service, Uh, when I was active, duty was spent overseas. That's one of the reasons that my family didn't follow me. So, um, trying to call back home, uh, waiting in a long line. You know, maybe two hours. You finally get to the to the pay phone on this ship, and then you use the card and thio kind of like catch up it Z not the same as just being there in person. So I think that that was a really big challenge that I had to overcome, um, from being in the service"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How do you manage both career and family effectively?,"I think for people that have families I didn't understand at the time. But I think it's very important now is that they have as much time with their families as possible. I think if you have a one year old kid, you should be there. You should be a physical presence. You should be there as much as possible. Um, and of course, you have Thio do deployments. You have to, like, go away for, like, six months. But the counter to that is that when you're home, you really need to be home as a single guy. I remember going overseas and then coming back. And then, um, I still wanna work, uh, even longer once 1 1600 hit, which meant, um, yeah, we have preventive maintenance. Let's get it done. Uh, yeah, we have to, like, do some kind of volunteer service. Let's let's go ahead and do that like every single thing. Like I I didn't mind doing it, but I can completely see how someone with family needs toe, you know, make the snippet, you know, cut it off and choose to have that time dedicated to his family."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What should I get ready to live overseas?,"If you're headed out there, especially overseas, then you need to get all of your household shipping goods in order. Uh, their websites and places to go for that. The sooner you get it out there, the better. Because I know that people who wait, uh, they get over there and then all of a sudden there, there without fridges and microwaves and the basic necessities and that that, you know, a few weeks is pretty trying for them. You also want to get your support network. They're a swell once you get to your new command and you don't know anyone, uh, it's ah, kind of a long battle because by the time you you find the person that you're supposed to be around, uh, they could say, Okay, well, uh, you need to do this next thing, and that next thing is gonna take another week. And, uh, if anything goes wrong with that paperwork, you could be sitting there, you know, like like a month without the thing that you really, really need. Uh, that could be your uniforms or your clothes or your kitchen utensils or your car, Um, a myriad of items. So just the sooner you start, the better"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What resources should I look for when I know I am moving to a location?,"when you're going to a new location, you should have received several items from the command. For instance, you might get an email from the command master Chief. Uh, it might have a welcome aboard package, which goes through a list of items that are really useful. Tow newcomers. You can also go to websites. Um, that, for instance, my navy portal or whatever the current website is, that gives you a list of documents that you need to fill out. And some, um, some pretty good advice. Your ship or your command might also have a household goods item shipping office that can explain how much things would cost and the range of times that you can expect your goods to be there. Um, once you go to your new location"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What kind of things may fall between the cracks when moving?,"when you're moving to a new location, it's good to think about all of the things that you currently have and then just like mark them off one by one. And there could be cracks associated with any of them. If you think about your household goods, then how am I gonna get all the boxes, uh, to the place to my new location. Where are they gonna be sent? That's something that a lot of people don't I don't think about like if there's some kind of distance, if you have some kind of like you might need to get it from that place to your new location, you might need a truck. You might need a U haul, or they might send it yourself. Um, those could be overlooked if if you used to do in a certain way, you can think about your kids. Um, their new school. Do you need to talk to the teachers? Do there doesn't need to be some kind of signature that you need to sign. Um, you can also think about your car. Your car might have a different insurance requirement once you go to a new place, especially if you're like? Like, for instance, going to Japan if you have your license. Um, just as long as you have the list of items and you check each one by one, um, thinking about the place that you're going to, then you shouldn't have any problems."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What should I get ready before I deploy?,"before you deploy, somebody should have already given you a list of items that you need to have ready the main ones being your uniforms. You know, once you have your uniforms, you can basically go anywhere and then everything else can come later. But it's the things that come later. Those are the things that make life good or bad in that place. So, um, you might want to talk to somebody else who's actually done the deployment to the same place that you're going to or you can get in contact with someone who's already there to kind of get an idea about what else you need. Things like that could be, um, your personal items if you play video games if you have a TV. If you have, um, some cooking habits that that you want to be shipped over there, um, there's a long list of items, um, that you can get help for either locally or from your new command."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How do you stay in touch with family and friends?,"with each new decade. The way I stay in touch, it modifies itself. When I first joined the Navy back in 2000, the main way was, um, actually just driving down, um, making the 18 hour trip from Washington toe toe Los Angeles and yeah, in person. But of course, that gets old. Um, I wasn't a letter writer, but I I know that people write letters all the time, and I have paid a pretty penny, uh, making the calls from, you know, from far away. Um, yeah, I saw, like, 102 $100 bills. Um, sometimes once the internet started to become more popular than Yeah, a Well, um, later on Skype, the video conferencing really helps out a lot. And then finally, um, now I think everybody has the cell phone. It took me a long time to get one, but now I text and message. And yeah, it's super cheap and super free. Super immediate. So those are the ways that I communicate"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What is the best plan for if your family has an emergency and you are away?,"if you're going overseas, The most immediate and most important thing that you need Thio be aware of is the ombudsman. That's a civilian that's local. Who knows where you're going to be going. And there's an ombudsman at your at your new commanders. Well, they communicate with each other, and they're the spousal connection that is made, Um, especially if you're unable to be connect, uh, to be contacted."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"What is military vacation like? (Length, accrual rate, types of leave)","military vacation is, uh, well needed. Rest from all the work that you've been doing. Especially if you just came back from deployment. I remember some of my vacations Where, um, maybe two weeks. And that's when I I would drive from a South Carolina toe Michigan, and just hang out. Just leave the Navy behind. I think I spent another, um, semester learning another language in Monterey. I took a flight, and then I think I spent maybe, uh, 2.5 months from saved up leave toe to go and you know, like just leaving behind, learn another language and then come back. So you get about a month every single year of of saved up leave. If you go like 33 years or four years, um, then that can start to accumulate. So generally they expect you to take about two weeks per year. But if you talk to the right people and especially if if you're on a downtime at your current command, then you can extend it. Like I said, I actually went to college for a while as well. So you just have toe being good communication with your supervisors."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What is the best way to be happy with your time in the service?,"a za longs. You realize the goal of the mission that you're fighting for a bigger cause than the time that you spend in the Navy, Uh, can really feel fill you with a sense of pride. Um, life is gonna be tough, especially for the younger people, you know, 22 23 years old. Um, if you're in the power plants, then you're gonna be sweating all the time. If you cook, they know that you're still gonna have to do general quarters. You're gonna be putting on this, uh, firefighting outfit and, you know, like fighting fake fires. And, ah, lot of it might not seem so so necessary. Uh, you're gonna be training day after day, month after month, and you're gonna say, Hey, you know what? We've never seen a fire. Or maybe one fire happens every three or four months. Like why? Why do we all trained so hard for so long? And as you as soon as you realize that, um, the goal of the mission is to be always prepared and to know exactly what to do to have immediate response, then that's gonna fill you with a sense of ease. Uh, saying that. You know what? Um, everyone's looking out for my safety. I'm protecting America, and my ship is protecting myself. So a songs you realized the goal of the mission. Um, then you'll be all right."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What are the ribbons/awards that you've gotten?,"I've been in the Navy for 20 years, and I picked up many awards during that time. You generally get an award or a ribbon every two or three years, and these are the ones that I've received so far. They're labeled in order of precedence from the top to the bottom at the very top. I have, ah, Navy achievement mental now. And this is generally the highest award that most people most enlisted people get. I got this one for being a shipyard superintendent at my last command. Sassa Bill. Um, the shipyard was going through an intense availability at the time, and I did quality work there. On the next road down, you can see that I have meritorious unit commendation amok. And this is when I was on the USS John C. Stennis. The aircraft care and the whole entire ship received this award. So as long as you're part of the team, you get that, uh, next over, we have a good conduct awards, and as long as you're in the military and you don't have any infractions, then you pick those up. Besides that, we have the, um, National Defense Service medal. You get this award for being in one of several wars, Uh, could be the Korean War, Vietnam War, Iraqi freedom or the Persian Gulf War. So I was in Iraqi freedom. The next road down, you can see that I have to global war on terrorism medals when it's for service, when it's for expeditionary. The expeditionary medal I got for being unemployment, fighting counterterrorism. The one after that we have the sea service deployment ribbon. And I was on a deployable unit USS John C. Stennis. So I got that one. The one down is things is the Navy and Marine Corps overseas service ribbon. So many reserves don't get this. But I was fortunate toe be able to go to Japan and then work accessible several times. And I got that one from doing that, Um, these air to marksmanship ribbons. One is for pistol. One is for rifle. The pistol, uh, you shoot far away targets standing and kneeling and the rifle you also have toe lay flat. And you get that. I was also fortunate enough to pick up my warfare pins. Um, we have the surface which is your main qualification, and then air and you pick these up by understanding what different types there are, what different payouts there are with different weapons systems. They have things like that. It's pretty intense training about half year, but yeah, I was fortunate to get those."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"What is X, Y, and Z for getting an award? How did you get your award(s)?","If you're trying to get an award, unless it's the voluntary A service medal, then maybe you're thinking about it the wrong way. There are many people who actually do their job, and they try to do it really well. And then they want an award for it later on. And I think that's the wrong way to go about it. Basically, if you do your job, you do what you're told and you do it inefficient, fast manner. Then words gonna come. Um, sometimes there are unexpected, like the last name that I got. You know, it was very unexpected, but I could see why they gave it to me, because I did something very difficult in a really fast way. Um, but other awards, uh, they they come just from being on the team, and the leadership generally Davies it out. So if you don't get an award and you think that you should get award, I say you just bide your time. And as long as people know you as someone who's dependable, whose independent, then you get an award"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?,"some of the main challenges that I faced when I started, uh, going through my educational career was, um I mean, I I didn't have the most money. My mother wasn't working to regularly. My my sister was on welfare and she had three kids of her own. And, um, yeah, I didn't have all the basic necessities. It didn't really bother me too much because, like, I didn't feel like I needed, um, many things, But yeah, we didn't have a car most of the time riding around on the bus on many occasions, didn't have enough money for, um, for paying for things that school food was basically free. You know, I don't think that I ever wanted for food. I just didn't eat that much. So I wasn't that hungry. School was in the morning, and at night time we had enough, um, food on the table, so that wasn't a big problem. But it's more for things that make you a better person through life, For instance, like having enough money toe go to the theater or having some cash for your local comic book. You know, I didn't have those those type of things. Um, Christmas time was, uh, they give you some gloves, and that was among some other things. You know, they they tried and not gonna complain. You know, I had a good life. I had a loving family, so I'm not gonna push that too hard. But your basic material things was something that I think would have given me a bit a better or a different perspective. Uh, coming up through the, uh, through the years, I was young, um, and obviously, like, growing up like this By the time I let's say, got to the navy, I don't think that I had a very strong work ethic. I did come and I did learn I was in the nuclear propulsion field and I think someone who had a different lifestyle, for instance, you know, they had their standard 1300 s a t know that their tutors coming coming through it. Not all of them were like that, but just a few. I think that they probably had, ah, better a better quality of education while they were through the program. Whereas for me, you know, I Yeah, sure. I read the book sometimes, and I tried to understand as much as I could, but I didn't have the basic electron ICS to give me that preparation. You know, I didn't know what a ground was. I I barely knew what current was like. I had to understand everything from the very, very beginning. When I think some of those things I should have gotten through public education through the books, I would have read if I would have been a good student or through the training, I would have gotten, you know, had I been a better student in school. Um, so the good thing about the Navy is they do start you off on on an even playing field like you. We expect that you know nothing. They expected people like me, which was which was excellent. So I'm just saying I didn't become the superstar right out the gate actually had toe put in. I think all the effort that I should have in high school in, um in school and, you know, I took the challenge and that was successful."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What is the most challenging part about your job?,"The most challenging part of my job is probably the most important as a military person in general. And that's taking ownership of whatever it is that you're doing, especially in new school. You actually have toe go to the library, get the steam propulsion manual and start reading, you know, left and right. You don't know something's And yeah, you have some access to other people who know where the material is, But they actually like force you to do a lot of research on your on your own to do the homework on your own. I don't think Yeah, After you start getting a certain G p a like 3.8 Onda above which I had, they don't even expect you to do homework. They just have the tests and say here, you know, you you study night and day Do do baby sit you, um, in a school toe degree. So, for instance, if you're not doing well, you know, you have, like, less than three point? No. Then you have an extra 20 to 40 hours extra that they expect from you. I'm I'm assuming that other, um, eight schools are similar, but maybe not that intense. You know, maybe the material isn't quite as dense, but, um, they do hold your hand through the education. You only have yourself to blame if you don't go through that. But after the two years of a school, uh, then they let you free. You're free to go and especially nukes. They expect you toe, you know, be smart to accept the training. Some of its really dense and you, you know, way above your grade. Your pay grade. So, um, especially the first year, too. They're talking about the top of the, um, aircraft carried all the way to the bottom, to the left and right. And, you know, the electrons that go into it, the things that they need to purchase and how the Cellini cell works on the inside. And, you know some of those things you you barely glossed over in a school. But now they're giving you an in depth, um, rundown of each thing and it, you know, it just goes over your head. But the fortunate thing is, you don't have to memorize those things. I think a lot of it is just they just want you to have some experience with it. And after two years or three years, then you become a pro. And there's this, like path that you're supposed toe, you know, adhere to the whole entire time for you to become that pro. Um, so when you're going through it at the at the very, very beginning, you're you're not sure about how much you're supposed toe ingest. Technically, you could spend all watch just reading all books, which is what they expect you to do, which is what they tell you to dio, um, you could spend, um, you know, hours after your eight hour workday just still reading and still not read enough. You know, it's an infinite amount of material that should be covered. That's gonna help you get promoted on the test. You know, the higher your score like, let's say, um, you score really well and then you will be promoted based on, like the percentage that you score above other people. So, yeah, the cool thing is, there's a there's a range for everyone. So if you don't score pretty well, then you know you get promoted a little bit slower. And if you do, um, just read nonstop constantly, then their path for you to become an officer toe get promoted early. So, um yeah, As long as you take ownership of yourself, then I think that that's probably one of the most challenging things that you have is a military person in the new field."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What is the biggest failure you ever had and what did you learn from it?,"the biggest failure that I ever had, which I think about even all the time to this day is trying to get into the Naval Academy from doing two years in the new school and not being accepted. I I was putting forth my full effort every single weekend or maybe every other weekend. You know, depending you'd have some test on Monday. And I remember just not really understanding all the new material that that that week and just being totally confused. But I remember just going in as soon as Friday. The bell hit, you know, just stand at the library. Read, read, read. Going dinner. Come back, read, read until they kick you out, I think midnight or something. Um, Saturday was, you know, you wake up in the morning, maybe you exercise. Maybe you like, uh, eat some breakfast, and then you go in and you're there until midnight. You don't go anywhere else. Um, that Saturday was full of white boards and writing paper until my finger had, like, calluses on it. And then the Sunday would, um, would be more like, you know, review of what I did. I probably teach other people and that actually helped myself. Um, pretty much the whole day. And I wouldn't go home until I was sure that I would get a four point on the next test. Um, I think I got a four point at once, but the point is that I was I was confident in all of my answers. Um, So I did that for two years because to tell you the truth, I wasn't really interested in the in nuclear propulsion actually want to be a cryptologist. But I heard that this program, which I wasn't familiar with it had lots of math and science, and he transferred fluid flow in chemistry. It had all of that. And I thought that that would be a really good way Thio cover those things that I didn't in high school and prepared before the, you know, the intensive Naval Academy. So at at that two year point when I applied, I was, you know, had a really high G p a. I had a pretty good recommendations from all of my officers. Um, it came back, rejected, and I was actually surprised. Um, later on, the x o of the academy called me out of the blue I was studying, you know, kind of like, you know, like, um frustrated. And he called me and he said, Hey, you know, like, um, I just want to let you know, Like we saw your, uh, your application and, you know, we have some chit chat, and he said, Well, you know what? Like I think I'm gonna send you to boost, you know, because like, you're an excellent candidate, by the way, Um and then I told him I'm sorry. I'm, uh, past the age. I was 22 but I would would have been 23 by the time. And that's the cut off. And, you know, that was that was surprising to him. You know, I think it was prepared to like Cindy, and and he said, Well, what's honestly, you know, what was the case? Why did you choose your major? So he basically told me why I was rejected. I actually chose economics instead of engineering. Um, Major And I told him that, you know, I think I give some answer that I wanted to, like, learn languages. And I didn't think that it really mattered what major you did as long as you know, like you're gonna just learn leadership and other, um, military qualities at the academy. And he said, Yeah, actually, were we expect engineers, uh, you know, computer science, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering. You know, those those are the main ones that we wanted. So, yeah, we parted ways and I didn't get accepted. And that that was first time I've ever, ever really tried something other than tracking cross country in high school. But, um, academically, that's the first time I've ever put forth my full effort at something and then didn't get accepted. That's my biggest failure."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What are the failures for which you are the most unhappy?,"I experienced many failures. Um, all the time. The one that I'm most unhappy with is what? When I tried to apply it to the Naval Academy and didn't get accepted, I think another failure that I had, at least, um, academically is when I was at Berkeley and I didn't go home and read all the chapters. You know, they say, like, this is how you succeed, you know, read this and do this, you know? And I didn't really push myself as hard as I should have. And that lasted my whole career. Sometimes I did. You know, sometimes I was, you know, during the weekend, I just like reading, reading code and code. But other weekends, I just, you know, like I got a C or a B on a test. And, you know, like, I feel like, Hey, you know what? I should have really pushed myself a little bit harder during that time. But the failures that I have currently are the ones that are that I'm most unhappy with Andi. This means as a chief, um, you have people under you and I I felt them all the time. I try it. You know my hardest. I tryto get them awards and they don't get accepted for I try to get them promoted and they don't get, um, the the credit that they that they want. I try to write the most fair evaluation that I that I can and some of the ones that have the lower ones, you know, I have to explain. And then they walked out the room and I say, Hey, how did you try to change him? Did you try to get that? You know that three point. Oh, upto a four point. Oh, Did you give them all the tools that were necessary so he could succeed? And yeah, this is constant. So, um, you're still happen all the time, But, you know, you live with them and you have to just think that you tried toe do the best that you could during the time"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How accepting of failure is this work environment when a good and honest effort was made?,"I think that this environment can be very accepting if you really try. But for the most part, looking at the thing that they're asking you to do and then seeing the result from my experience, it seems that most of the time they asked you to do reasonable things in a reasonable, reasonable amount of time. Um, if they say you know what we need, Um, you need to do preventive maintenance on this pump on DWI. Give you like, two days for this. There's almost no excuse for why you can't do it, of course, like let's say you break your leg or let's say you open it up and there's a wrench in there that you have to do something else Thio, you know, like get it out. You know they're those exceptions, But, um, aside from exceptions, the Navy is really good, you know, in the in the top 99 percentile of asking you to do Onley things that you can do. And I think that it's your job that if you cannot do the job in the requested amount of time, it's your responsibility and we train you on this that you have to tell them before. So that means with those two things, A. We're giving you a reasonable amount of things to do and be You should tell us beforehand if it ever gets to the point where it's the end and you say I'm sorry it didn't happen. Um, most of the time, I'm not pretty forgiving about that, and rightly so."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What are sources of support when you took a chance and the result was poor?,"a chance that I recently took when I was on annual training was at the USS Blue Ridge. I was the chief, the new chief in charge of making sure that we successfully passed our insert requirement in service. I mean, it's ah really comprehensive test that all the departments of the ship have to pass. And as a new chief, I was I was supposed Thio get all the electrician's to do all of the jobs that they were supposed to, and I think that they were very, very far behind. That's one of the reasons that I was called there and, uh, we didn't do too well. I think we scored in the mid range and the most of the ship. They passed pretty pretty well, either green or, you know, like slightly under. But our electrical division was just so so in that. In that respect, I think that we were working really hard every single day. Um, warning tonight. You know, uh, kind of directing some of the guys toe, go fix things and do preventive maintenance on things. However, we couldn't catch up from the like maybe year. That had been kind of like slowly keeping behind us. There were too many things to fix. Too many lights that we hadn't seen too many rooms that we didn't know where they were too many like bakers that we couldn't open once they were open, like inside. We have to, like, do some other things to make it work properly. And we couldn't catch up, Um, to the time, um, that insert was to be successful in that regard. Who did I talk to? You know, uh, that's the thing. You always have to have feedback to the people above you, your superiors, your devo, Um, even the commanding officer in this case, you know, I remember the commanding officer of the Blue Ridge was down with us down in the in the aft steering room. Um, making sure that the the I think it was some kind of valve that was supposed to be, um, that was affecting the engine room. He was there, you know, like turning a wrench with us. So as long as everyone up the chain knows exactly where you are and what your problems are than they're a little bit more forgiving for that, it's when you try to hide things. And, you know, you say, like, Hey, I could do it. You know, I'm a single individual or I'm the leader of this crew, you know, And you don't feed the information back up the chain. That's when they start, um, being frustrated with you. So a songs You have that chain that you keep informed, you good to go."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"How does someone recover from a professional ""bump in the road""?","If you encounter some kind of obstacle in your career ahead, you have to make sure that you understand that there are many, many opportunities for you. Toe. Prove your your quality. Um, yeah, you You try and you don't get that award or I think a big one a huge one is that you don't get in une p an early promote for your professional recommendation. One of those things comes along in in a year, you know? And if you don't get that, that means that your, uh, some people consider that your second or third down the rank, that's what it can mean. But as long as you don't feel yourself being that way, as long as you think of yourself as an e p um, and you present yourself in that way for the next year, then it's gonna it's gonna average out. That's the point that you need to realize you can e p this year and MP the next year must promote another MP MP and then NDP. You know, overall Hey, you know what like like you were pretty good for the whole entire, you know, for your career. Um, not everyone's gonna have going to be the perfect person in the unit in the division the whole entire time. And it's the job of the leadership toe actually divvy out things in proportion. You know, a few awards here. Ah, few promotes their, ah, few, like, you know, like shaking the hand of the seal here, you know, and they should spread it out. So as long as you consider your whole career kind of spread out with good quality, then, um then those bullets enrolled won't matter. Um, when you look back to history,"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What was a pivotal moment in your career/life?,"Ah, pivotal moment in my career. I think most people who are chiefs would say the time that they became a chief the time that they got accepted. But I would say that it actually came a few years before that when I when I made first class. Uh, that's the time that I think I've been in for maybe six years. And I had recently had a bolt in the road where I didn't get accepted. I missed the first class exam by, like, 60.1%. Um, uh, yeah, it is very, very close, you know, like anything, if I would have gotten an award or like maybe one more point on my evil, anything would have would have bump me up to the to the next rank. So by that next time actually took a weekend, um, and study for the exam. It's the first time that I did, and I remember going through the books, seeing like what you're supposed to study and like circling things and like on a sheet of paper, you know, like, um, writing down things that that I needed to memorize. It's kind of like a nuclear power school. I think I spent, like, eight hours per day. Um, for those three days. And then by the time I got the the recommendation, I think I scored in the top 99% of nuclear propulsion engineers, and I kind of saw you know what? Like the power of self studying, it actually really does. Guide, um, your progress. And I think I still hold on to that. I now, based on what I did and the amount of effort that the the positive result that I saw for myself, I can now confidently tell my other people Hey, you know, if you study, you will most likely see success. And I mean that instead of just, like, maybe, uh, chit chat from other people who maybe haven't studied, but just kind of say like, Hey, you know what it za right thing to do. So I have experience with that myself."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What's the biggest risk you've taken in your career?,"the biggest risk I've taken in my career would probably be when I chose to take the shipyard superintendent role in festival. Now, I have been a nuclear propulsion engineer for my entire career, Um, tears at school and then six years on an aircraft care. Um, once you stop becoming Anak, did you remember and you switch over from a nuke to a regular electrician's, Then you're dealing with things that you have never seen before and some of it's great. Um, I actually put armatures in for motor before I've never done that. I've actually, like dipped huge pieces of mechanics, uh, mechanical pieces. I've actually ran cables. I've taken out entire circuit breakers with civilians, you know, like all these things I've never seen before and and it really build your, um, build your experience. But the shipyards superintendent, though that's, um, after eight years of doing the reserve and doing electrical things, you know, things that I kind of knew about. The shipyard superintendent was an entirely new role. That's when you actually have to get out of the propulsion plant and see every single thing that there is to know about the ship and multiple ships, ships I've never even seen before. Um, em cm's mine sweepers. Um, destroyers, uh, you actually have toe go up to the navigation room and understand what's going on there. You have to go to the the main deck and the quarterdeck and, uh, you know, like fixing walls and paint. And, uh, like there's so many things that I had no idea about, and yet I had to learn at the time. And for shipyard superintendents, they don't really have a tutor in front of you. You actually have to, like, just hop in there and just start learning, you know, like asking people, What is this? What is that? You know, reading computer drawings and books. And it was it was pretty intense. But, you know, you step up to the challenge and luckily you have a good support network there. I didn't know about that, but I didn't realize how how good it was. And you have successful in the job"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What is the most dangerous thing you've ever done on the job?,"the Navy is really good about giving you the correct material to use the more dangerous job gets. I've actually been around people who have went into a live 41 60 volt breakers. You touch it, you're done right. Ah, friend of mine actually was hospitalized. And what was paraplegic for a while? Another chief friend of mine based on doing those things. And you're around it all the time. Um, but in those cases they give you and you're supposed to use all the protective equipment that is necessary to do the job successfully and safely. Um, so I would say the mawr dangerous electrical work I've done, uh, the more safe I've been. Ironically, it's when you start going lower down the line of risk that your danger actually increases. Um, the most dangerous thing I've done is just being around the propulsion plant, Um, and not putting in your in your hearing protection. You know, you do that for a couple of a couple of months, and then all of a sudden, you know, you start hearing ringing in your ears, that Z, that's actually pretty dangerous. That's not something that civilians are normally exposed to. you know. So it's something simple. Like just wearing your PPE is, uh, is probably the most dangerous I would feel. But, like physically the most like on a day basis, the most dangerous thing I've done is probably, um, go up to the top of one of the light mass. We have to change the transistor eyes, me and another guy and you Absolutely, where? The crack material. But sometimes, you know, you have to, like, take off a hook and put the other hook on, you know, and you do that multiple times and you realize that, you know, let's say like you're not paying attention. There could be a time that you're way up there and it's just 11 slight small move, and you're either hanging up there or you actually fall to your death. Um, so, yeah, that's another thing that civilians really aren't really exposed to that if you're long enough, you will be"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What causes the most stress in your job?,"the cause of the most stress is when you have a job that needs to be done and you're not the one doing it, especially when you deal with people who don't have as much ownership of it as you would like them to. So, uh, one case that a recent experience I was a chief in charge of in serve and we have to make sure that all of the electrical equipment across the whole entire ship was complete to satisfaction. And you send to Electrician's up there. Maybe it's a third class and a seaman apprentice. You send another first class here to do that job second class here to do that job, and you have to walk around as a chief to make sure that everything gets done. And there's no way that you can check every single thing. And yet, like you realize that if something isn't done particularly right, we check an automatic bus transfer and it doesn't transfer. You know that's gonna look bad on you on the sailor, slightly but more on the department in general, and it's it's kind of scary, you know, like like for most of the things I wish I was the one doing it. I wish I was the one, you know, correct. You know, correcting things, But, um, we don't work in that environment. We work in a team environment, and as a team, you actually have to really depend on your other team members. So some of them you wish were a little bit stronger. But that's a part of being in the Navy. That's a part of, like, training people. That's the part of, like, learning from your mistakes and making sure that, like, um, hey, you know what this was done incorrectly. Let's get it right the next time."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How do you deal with stress on the job?,"the way that I find the deal best with the stress is toe let out your grievances. Um, you get all your people together, you have a chat about what just went on, whether it's something in the future, and you're not sure that they could do it correctly, whether something in the past that they maybe have gotten wrong or even just yourself, you know, like maybe you don't perform always perfectly. Maybe they have some grievance since grievances towards you. So you want to actually talk to them and say, Hey, you know what? Like wrong the same team here. Let's figure out how weaken move forward from now on successfully. So just chatting and talking about is the best way to relieve stress."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What is a trick that you use to keep stress from boiling over?,"the trick that I tend to use a lot, especially when I'm dealing with other people. And, uh, one person isn't satisfied with the other, whether it's my leadership or whether it's someone subordinate to me. Um, yeah, after chatting with them and trying to talk things out, especially if that doesn't work. Even if it does, you should just go up to the top. Um, look at the stars, Look at the sky, look at the sun and, you know, breathe. Think about other things in your life. Think about you know what this is. Ah, job. And it's a stressful one. And it's the one that you signed up for, and it's actually exciting in a lot of cases. Um, once you understand your you know, you just one little cog in the Navy and that you know you'll get past whatever it is that you're facing, it's easy to go back down and say, All right, well, let's go ahead and do this whether you're frustrate or not or not. You just breathing its's gone"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How do you handle self doubt?,"Whenever I come across self doubt, I look a my past successes in life. I was the one who was accepted to become a chief, which is a very, very hard thing to do something that takes a lot of like, um, long excellence. Thio actually have happened. Um, Thio and I was the one that they chose. It builds my self confidence. I look at the fact that I was accepted to Berkeley. There's some people who have had a really great life, have had tutors and have been trained on distill Don't get accepted to that university, and I was accepted. That builds my confidence. I have to say that I was in the military, and particularly I was a nuclear trained engineer. There's some people who can't get into the military through their past criminality. Or maybe they're out of shape. Or maybe they just don't have the discipline. You know, I had that. I'm a veteran myself. I joined the long ranks of people, um, who have been veterans, and I've pride for that. You know, that builds my self confidence and particularly the nuke field. That's something that I hadn't been trained for. The my whole entire life. I wasn't a really good student in school. And yet here I waas, learning what some would say is one of the most difficult things to learn. In general, in life, there's rocket engineering and nuclear engineering. You know, those are the two ones that are that are thought off as being really difficult. And here I was a nervous kid from Michigan who is actually studying this stuff. So whenever I come across something new, something challenging, I just have to remember Hey, you know what? Like I could do this because I've done almost, um, the hardest things that you can do as an American and I was successful at it."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How do you handle fatigue at work?,"I won't lie. Fatigue really gets to There is sometimes that I was on deployment. And I'm telling you, every four days you were up 24 hours. That is You wake up, um, seven o'clock, one day you have your normal work day. You go ate lunch, then you come back after that, you know, one hour, and then you you have a five hour watch. All of a sudden, you realize that it's eight o'clock, and then you have your general quarters and that last and especially like the longer ones, you know, like it could be close to midnight. Um, and then you have toe, actually, uh, do some kind of preventive maintenance. Or there's something that that happens all the way up until the next work day. And then you have your normal work day and yeah, every every four days. It tended to be, um, a really long day, and it wears on you. How do you deal with those things? Well, it helps to be young. That that's that's for sure. I I think that I could still do it now and maybe with a bigger smile on my face. But back in the time. I think that my energy really helped me. The fact that I was in pretty good shape the fact that you know, like, yeah, you're kind of sleepy. But, you know, you drink some coffee and you wake up the fact that I was, like, a pretty healthy from my from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet. So to make sure that I'm in that type of shape, you have to make sure that you take care of your body, you know, you run, you, you eat healthy. Um, you're not overweight, And, uh, then yeah, yeah, the navy page young guys toe go out and do the difficult, hard, sweaty work. Um, and you just realize that it's not gonna last forever."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How do you ensure that boring work gets done well?,"boring work can exist all over the place, but you just have to make sure that you keep it light. Um, there's some kind of levity that you can have toe that that you conclude include to every job. And it makes the time go by a lot faster. Um, there's a time that, like, let's have a control point watch, which is when you're down in the bottom of the plant you have toe, make sure that everybody that goes into the reactor room is properly frisk, which means that they have Ah, you have a wand. And you, um, go up and down their body and make sure that, you know, like they go in without any, uh, zoom is on them and they come out without any zoom is on them. And to make sure that that they didn't pick something up on the inside, Um, it could be maybe two hours or three hours that nobody comes in. Maybe you could spend a whole six hour watch and you don't see anyone. Maybe they're coming in back and forth. So, uh, in moments like those when you're all alone, uh, it could be good toe. You know, have a book that you're kind of reading, Obviously, Like, uh, a technical book. Um, when people come back, back and forth, you kind of joke with them like, Hey, what's going on up there on the top side? And, you know, like, uh, you kind of play with them a little bit, and that makes the time go by a little bit faster."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How do you deal with an increase in tempo?,"Whenever I find that there's an increase in tempo. To tell you the truth, you just go into auto mode before you know it. Like it's six o'clock in the morning and, uh, you eat breakfast. You think you eat breakfast and there could be, Ah, dinner in there, but all of a sudden you're in Iraq about toe knock out and sleep So some people don't really like that, that extra sweaty running work. But for me, like like that just made the day go by a lot by a lot quicker. And, um, you know, if you're doing interesting work, So, for instance, like, let's say, there's, ah, a casualty control procedure. Um, you're down in the plants and then the reactor scram. Then all of a sudden, you have to, like, go to your post and you know, turns from switches and call into the watch up through this and you have tow, you know, like, uh, put on your PPE to go fight a fire, you know, then those can actually be kind of kind of exciting, and you actually look forward to those those high temple times"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What are common crimes people in your field commit that need to be watched for?,"the most common crime that I see. Um, not so much in the nuclear field, because we were, you know, smacked on a hand about that. But ever since I became a reservist and going forward, um, in electrical side not to put them on blast. But I Honestly, I just see more. See it more common is negligence. It's when your gun decking gun decking means that you have, like, some some task that you're supposed to do and like, let's say it's you're supposed to look at all the fire hydrants and make sure that, um, they're they're cleaned and you're supposed to, right? Yeah, sure. Like like I actually looked at it and it could be many of them, you know, it could be 100 of them. Um, some of them are hard to find or some of them, Uh, maybe you're just lazy that day, and you can kind of, like, sign sign it off as being complete. You'll get it on the next round. And that does happen. Um, as a chief, you just have to make sure that you spot check these things and and there's a whole pro program about that. Where where leaders Ah, look at random things and make sure that, you know, like, um, everything is being done to completion, but they still find them. Um, those people still get in trouble, but that's the number one thing that you have to be aware of as a leader."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What part of your future are you most worried about?,"The thing I'm most worried about as a Navy person is the continuation of my career. I'm of course, I would like to do the maximum time, which is 24 years for a chief. But to tell your truth, being in the reserves really aligns well with my civilian career. Especially because I'm considering having a federal job and I don't actually don't want to get out at 24 years. You're supposed Thio. Get out and you become a great soldier and you just, um you're allowed to go on based on the base and you're allowed to experience, like, veteran things all the way up until you retire. And that's when you start getting money. But actually don't wanna really experience that so much. I wanna keep serving. And one way to do that is to be promoted to become a senior chief. So that could be something that I'm working on right now and also to be a nawf sir. And they haven't even longer career progression all the way up to 30 years. And that's something that I'm considered right now as well"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What worries do you have about your professional future?,"currently, I would say that I don't really worry about my professional future. I only see things that is positive. Um, even if I got out of the military, uh, in my current form, I think I could be okay with that. When I was a first class, I think the chief told me, You know what? I'm a chief, and you know, I'll probably retire the chief, and I'm comfortable with that. And I didn't quite under understand it at the time. I said, Hey, you know, you should always try toe push forward, push ahead. You know, like, there's so many things that you could do, you know? But, um, now that I'm a chief, I kind of see you know his point. You're doing something really productive. You definitely see your place in the military community as being valuable. And you've had a long history of it. Uh, there's that. That's absolutely honorable. Um, so now that I'm not worried about being so strict about that early promote being so strict about, um always trying to get the highest quality job that I could get being the senior enlisted adviser, or being the command master chief or if those things are out of my mind Thin those air, Just goals. Now, I'm not worried about it. I I just feel that those I can put forth the effort that it takes to get there. And if someone gets chosen over me, you know, I I clap my hands and say good on him. Um, tryto be like him as much as possible. And if I'm not, then I'm not gonna beat myself up over it. There's so many other opportunities out there a Sfar as family and friends and my civilian promotion that you know what? Like it's just one small piece. My military career is just one small piece of a really big, huge and enjoyable life puzzle that I'm trying to fill."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"If you could change one thing about your job, what would it be?","if I could change something about my job, I would think the type of things that are requested from me. I would definitely want to expand that right now. As a zone electrician's chief. I mean, the most of the time I'm in the role of Y N. C s senior chief Yeoman, that does a lot of administration work. I make sure that all of my my sailors go to the places that they're supposed to for their annual training, that they have the words that they're supposed to get that I, um that they have the evaluations, um, back and back and forth that they're correct, that they're done correctly, um, that the people that are supposed thio be the EPS and the MPs and the piece, uh, that those are the rankings that we give that they're fairly distributed on. Uh, I'm glad I'm in that position, but I would also like to have other opportunities. Not just that and for the reserves, you know, because we we're not active duty. There are only limited roles that we can take. Um, for most of the people in Los Angeles, we go to this one building and all of the people in l. A. Go to that same building. Um, surge main has one single floor, and, you know, like there aren't that many jobs that we can take. Um, whereas if you were an active duty member as electrician's, there's a long list of jobs that you could take throughout the country that you could go toe Norfolk for this. You goto Japan for, uh, to be a shipyard superintendent. You can, you know, be, uh, get in the chemistry if you want to. You can go back to an aircraft, care to be an electrician's. You know, there's, ah wide range of jobs that you can take, but being in the reserves, you know, it's very, very limited, so I prefer that to be extended."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What used to be your biggest weaknesses?,"My biggest weakness used to be the fact that I always wanted to do things myself. I thought it was ownership when I was giving a task and said, Hey, you know what? You have these five people go ahead and get this done. Or maybe just you yourself, go ahead and get this done. And I wouldn't want to ask people how to do things I was very, very interested in, You know, not only getting the credit for it, but also learning about the thing that I'm trying thio to fix or, you know, operating as my with my team, Um, to make sure that like it's it's a goal that we ourselves completed. And even though there is some justification to that, that might be the wrong way to go. Um, if there's something that you don't know about rather than spend half an hour or two hours or even longer to try to figure this out myself just because I'm so stuck on the ownership portion, uh, what I've learned as a chief is you know what we're about. Speed here is well, so you have to, like, turn around, walk across the room, say, Hey, Have you ever experienced this? Get it in a few seconds and then go across and and keep it flowing. So I think about I'm a lot more efficient assed faras, um, asking questions when I don't have the immediate answer."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Describe a time that you were put into an untenable ethical situation?,"one situation that really struck me is, uh, you know, having a profound effect on my career is when I was down in one of the plants and another crew member asked me, Hey, can you help me out with my maintenance? I said, Sure, I'm free. Hey, took me thio these two boxes and for most of the maintenance requirement courage, it takes one person to kind of look, um, maybe be a safety observer and explain things and another person actually be in the in the in the equipment. And in order to do any maintenance down in the nuclear power plants, there's a long process. You have to get permission from the watch officer. You have to hang danger tags. You have to have another person go around and look at the danger tags you have tow. You know, say that you're ready to work. You have to go down to the plant and actually like, set up the proper equipment. You know, there, we try to make it a safe. It's possible. So he said that he had done all of the requested, um, you know, background stuff. And he said, Yeah, you know, like I just go up there. But I think I was changing a V c. I or actually, there was something that I had to do. Ah, electrician's wise. Um, but he had me do it now. He said that it was the energized and he did the de energized checks. Um, and I actually, like, looked at actually like, um, I think that I checked it myself, or maybe I didn't, but, um, I did all the all the maintenance for it. I clean the inside. I was exposing myself to electrical wires. And then I shut it, and I looked at the sheet of paper and I was actually working on the wrong breaker. So he's the one who actually opened it. And he said, Yeah, it's ready to go. Hey, just need another person. But I was actually working in ah, free electrical breaker. And I think it's 450 volts. Um, so I was pretty upset about that. Um, Or maybe it was 1 20. I'm not I'm not really sure, but yeah, that I should have never been in that situation. And rather than go up until the Watch officer rather than make a big scene about it. I, um I got really frustrated, you know? I shut the door. You know, I didn't yell at him or scream at him. I just said, You know what? I'm never gonna put myself in that situation again. I'm gonna check every single breaker, every single tag. I'm always gonna look read every single instruction because I don't trust anyone at that time. And that was wrong. I should have ratted him out. I should have, um, made sure that he wasn't put in, that he wasn't able to put other people in that situation again. And that's unethical thing that, you know, I e actually got wrong."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How do I deal with an assignment that I don't like or that isn't a good fit?,"I think a lot of people get put in positions that they're they're not very comfortable with it. It's a part of the quality of being in the Navy. If you're put in a position that you don't want to be in, um, the things you can do is you can apply to other things. Um, if that's not really big option, then you can actually look for the positive things that are in your job and maybe have some kind of lateral rotation if if if if you're not really digging it. So, for instance, when I was in the Tech pub library, we actually have to, like, go up and, you know, like change these books. Um, there are other jobs down in the shop that, you know, I could use my, uh, computer science experience with so maybe actually logging all of the books. I was actually more of a computer science person rather than, like, you know, like someone who wanted to, like, get books and go to these These, uh, these lockers and exchange books. So maybe there's something within the community that you're in that you don't have to change their jobs for, but um that you could do that instead. Um, other. Otherwise, yeah. You might just have toe, uh, tough it out for the year or two that you're doing that job."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What things are there for me to do on a ship to reduce stress?,"an average day for me or an average week for me being the active duty military. Let's say your unemployment. Um, of course. You stand your watch, Of course. You stand your normal work day, and then you do preventive maintenance. You do general quarters every now and then. Um, so for those free time, those moments of free time that you have, I found myself down in some of the fan rooms, um, playing my guitar or learning guitar around the corner. They were, like, you know, made their own rock band. I remember I set up a little TV and have this little game console, and I played Star Wars. Um, yeah, I think I played the whole entire game. You know what? I was down there, um, up on the second deck. You know, there are lots of tables everywhere, so you find people playing cards and spades, Um, in some of the lounging areas, you know, a movie is gonna be on. Um, I found that I could draw a lot. I go to the N w r the Morale, recreation and, um recreation welfare office and get all of their DVDs. And I had a little CD player, Um, DVD player and I would play movies toe to my heart's content. Think I watched the whole entire episode of the wire and, um, lots of other, like many TV series and stuff. So, um, a lot of other people, they get their packets of cigarettes. I don't smoke, you know? But they go out there to the fantail, look across the ocean, and I have actually spent hours and hours out there not smoking, but just looking at the waves and water. Um, I was on an aircraft carrier to you Go up the vulture's row. You just see the ships come or I'm sorry. The planes come in and out, in and out. Um, yeah. You find time? Um, you're never bored. I don't think"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Where have you been in port?,"on active duty on the USS John C. Stennis Aircraft care. We've actually been to many different ports on three deployments. I've been to Hawaii many times. Honolulu, um, Kuwait. Bahrain have been to Australia, Perth in Tasmania when I, uh, chocolate at the Cadbury fan, uh, Cadbury factory and, uh, petted kangaroos. Something that you never get to see. You know, seen pandas. Um, I've actually been toe Japan. That's the first time I went to Japan, you know, in the very, very south. But it was a great, sensible Japan. I've been there several times again as a reservist on my annual trainings, Um, ranging from, like a few days toe more than a year. I've also been to Manila, um, And Kuala Lumpur. Yeah, many places."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Where were you stationed and what was it like there?,"as a nuclear train Electrician's. Uh, one of the things that I got I was really frustrated with was the fact that you don't get stationed overseas. Um, you used to be ableto be sent toe Japan. But when I joined, that was off limits at the time, and we were on Lee stationed domestically, so I went to school. Well, the cool thing is that I got to see all four corners of America. So my school was in South Carolina. Um, then I did my prototype. The school lasted about a year and a half. Then I did prototype for six months up in, um, upstate Albany, New York, Um, lots of trees and stayed in a nice house. Um, pretty close Thio downtown New York. Then I went to the lower left toe to San Diego and I'm from California. So I really enjoyed those times those three years that I was there half the time we were on deployment, So that's a killer. But my family was in Los Angeles, so I actually, like live with my family in L. A. And every single day I drove the hour and a half toe to my work work was from a, I think, six toe 12. And then at 12 o'clock just to be traffic that I drive up to Los Angeles. And time was times of great good weather. Uh, at the end of those three years, then I moved upto Washington, Um, the Washington State. And in Bremerton it wasn't for me. It's it's kind of gloomy a lot. But, you know, you find some things, uh, that are worth Well, lots of movies about my house, about a couple houses up there. Um, yeah. You hang out with friends at the local bars and clubs, But after the three years, um, that I was there, I decided to come back home to California. So I'm really glad that I got to see most of America based on the Navy and lots of port calls. Um, so overseas travel as well"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What things should I prioritize in a neighborhood when moving to a new location?,"the first thing that you should prioritize is, uh, house that you're gonna be living in. Um, one of the major questions that people have you know, especially if they have a family, is, um is gonna be big enough. I have some kids, so you might be stationed in a larger place or even a smaller place. Um, rather than the than the base. So you might wanna talk to whatever you need to talk to, to determine, like, how big your house is gonna be, What it has all the tools that you're that you're looking for. And then if it's not, then how do you How do you go about like, changing that living situation? Also the community. So I think back in Japan, um, Japan is really, really safe. Eso people who tend toe actually want to live off base so that they could be involved in, like, a local stores and and meeting other people rather than on base, which was kind of like far away from from everything, um, maybe they want to go to a different school as well. So just keep those things in mind where your kids gonna be going to school and if it's big enough and those should be the two main things"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,When do you get to choose if you are going to live in post or off post?,"generally, a decision like that is set, so if you have family and their space available on the base, they tend to want you to stay on base. But everything can have a waiver. Um, especially if, uh, they're close to maximum capacity and you choose to wanna live off base, and there's a good reason for it. Then you can talkto to some people and get off. On the other hand, if there aren't that many people on base, it's just cheaper for the military to keep you on base so you might not have a choice in that case."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,When do you need to find your own housing?,"Whenever there's a high volume area, then guaranteed, you're gonna have to live off base. And, uh, you always want to keep things in mind. How close is it? It has the right space. I knew some some person, like lived an hour outside of base just because, like, there was a big field for the kids and a nice school system and and they just took the hit and just made the made the long drive. But of course, it has to be within the stipulations. Um, there could be some rules about how far it could be a way. There could be some rules about, like, how much it costs. So, um, it's just gonna vary depending on where you're going to go."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,When should I own or rent?,"owning versus renting is something that's really going to depend on where you're going Going. Thio. I bought my first house when I was in Washington, and the house prices were pretty good. I think I I bought mine for 300,000 and the rates were actually pretty high. Um, you also wanna think about how long you going to stay there? So you have to stay there for at least two years if you're going to sell the house pretty soon and, um, not pay capital gains taxes, so things could change. Obviously, these are all things that you might wanna discuss with, um, attorney or some kind of lawyer who might give you better information. Um, but you might wanna think about the prices, how long you're gonna be staying there. You're going to stay there for a long time. Then generally, it's it's always better toe by, um if you're gonna just stay there for, let's say, uh, two or three years on Lee and then you're sure that you're gonna leave from the state than you might want to be renting, um, somewhere, um, above three years, but below 10 years. Say, uh, you might want to consider owning"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What types of services are easy to find vs. hard to find on a Navy base?,"When you're on a navy base, almost all of the major items are covered. Um, between the any X, the navy exchange and the commissary. The commissary is really cheap, and it has most of the main foods. The any X has a range of, uh, cheaper clothes. Thio more expensive clothes, but they're not going. Thio tend to have local items. So, for instance, when you're in Japan, um, all of the delicious items, like a yakitori and sake, you know, things like like that we're outside off the off the base. Um, also, like, very, very expensive items. So, like the newest Jordans or a necks pensive skateboard aren't gonna be, um, at the at the base. Uh, the index and the commissary has the basic items. So, like big and tall items, um, expensive items, um, unique items, local items. They're all gonna be found outside of base"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How often will I have to move? Will have to move more or less as a leader?,"as a leader, you tend toe, want to move more often. And that's because the the job opportunities become fewer and fewer if you wanna be specific about what you were trying to do. So, for instance, um, I could be a chief wherever I could go to San Diego, Aiken, Goto, Los Angeles. I could go toe Norfolk, and they're all going to need chiefs. However, if I wanna be, say, a command master chief, then there might not be a role like that, except for a few states. So I have to be very selective in which state I choose. Um, so obviously third class petty officer, you have your watch stations that you're qualified for. You have all the training that you've done, and you have a wide range of places that you can go. Um it also depends on the needs of the Navy, but for the most part, you have more choices. But as you grow up as you grow in your leadership responsibilities, they become more and more singular. Until, um, there could be a master chief out there. There could be one job in the whole world that's suitable for him. So, um, just think about the pyramid"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"Can you use outside communication on a deployment, like using the internet and email, calling by phone, and writing mail?","unemployment. Your access toe communication tools, uh, kind of goes hand in hand with your role. I think the more supervisory you are, the more access you have If you're, uh, third class or maybe even a seaman, um, new to the command, then you might be waiting in longer lines. Um, it also depends on when you're trying to access things. So if it's during the middle of the day, then yeah, during your lunch time, you might not even get access to the phone at all. So you have to, like, how many people are there And there could be like that third person in line who just is intent on talking Thio, uh, their husband the whole entire time. So you have to take that into account. Um, however, if you tryto talk at night time, you know, it could be like 2 a.m. Then, Yeah, you could be talking the whole entire time. Um, as faras Internet goes, uh, library tends to have some kind of station for you, and there's some kind of sign up list, so they're pretty good about, like, at least letting you access the Internet. But things change. It depends on which ship you are with ship you're on and what the structure is"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Can you drink alcohol when deployed?,"if you tend to not be able to drink when you're when you're out in the water. But, of course, when you pull in Yeah, that's the first thing that people, uh, people do is they go to straight to the bars. You're not supposed to bring the beer back, but you are allowed to drink on the many establishments outside. Uh, if you are in the middle of the water, then we have these things called still still beaches, which, for instance, like Fourth of July, The commanding officer might, um, say, hey, you know what? Like we're not working today, Um, since everybody up to the to the hangar bay or to the to the flight deck and you get two beers, they give you, like these ribbons. Um, and those two beers, like you can either drink. I know you're not supposed to, but some people, like, give ribbons to other people. They catch you doing that, then? Yeah, you'll be reprimanded, but yeah, two beers for that day, and then they don't want to see alcohol again. Um, you know, the next day or the day before, So the still beaches happened. Like I said, during holidays or after you've gotten done with some really intense training"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What have you seen people spend a bonus on that worked out well?,"I spent my bonus. I think it was $40,000. I got a tax free and I purchased my house with that, and that was a pretty wise investment. I still have the houses to this day, and I think, uh, it's gonna go ahead and him with my retirement. Um, other people they spent their car on, I think, for for our nuclear enlistment bonus, we got like, uh, some people got $12,000. I used my cash. I used mine for to go to school. I think I got $50,000 for tuition assistance. But other people, they didn't want the education and they just got the Marine 12,000 bucks. And next thing you know, we just barely joined and they're driving around in a new, uh 300 ZX or something. And I would say that that's a bad investment because it depreciates in value. But you can't convince them of that. They were having the time of their lives. And, uh, while I'm driving around in my eclipse, they're getting all the girls and going to all the parties and stuff in there. They're beautiful car, so I think they probably think it's worth it. So it depends on your personal style. What you want to spend your money on"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What kind of lifestyle can I afford as a junior officer without going into debt?,"I would say not just for junior officers, but for everyone even enlisted. You have to know, um, how much you can afford you Have you have your cash? Um, laid out annually. You set some kind of budget, decide if I'm making 60,000. Just live off of 50,000 and then split that up by months. And then that's the life that you can afford. So budgeting is really, really useful. I personally didn't need a budget, because I, um I lived as cheap as possible. And I just knew, You know, like, I have a $5000 check coming in every month and I live off of 1000 maybe $2000 per month then, um, yeah, all the rest of this goes and savings, but I know a lot of people aren't aren't like that. Some people have family that they have to like, they'd be out money to. Um, yeah, some people have espouses that really are very materialistic. And, yeah, like, debt is a really big problem in the military. So, um, a song. You keep a budget, you should be fine."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How do taxes work in the military?,"For the most part, we pay our general state and federal taxes just like everyone else. Um, for the time I joined, I just, like, sign some sheet of paper and didn't worry about it again. But other people are, ah, lot slicker than me, and this is what I mean. You always keep your home of record. My home of record is California, which means that I'll be a California resident no matter where I am. But for instance, when I was in Washington, Washington doesn't require state taxes, so there's a way that you can still be a California resident. But you signed the paperwork so that your ah, Washington resident, which means that you don't have to pay state taxes and California is your home of record. So you still get the benefits of still being associated with California. You could go to the all the universities, uh, that you want to You could get, uh, you could go to State college and still have all all that access. However, for tax filing purposes, uh, your your tax free I think Florida is like that as well. So, um, you just have to look at what your state, um, how you state covers active duty personnel and then take advantage of it that way."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,When do I need to worry about retirement?,"You should start planning on retirement as soon as you join the Navy. Once you get closer to 20 years, then you're thinking about the specifics, which they am I going to retire at? How many years exactly am I gonna have? How much money that's gonna be at the very, very end. But earlier on in your career, you might want to think about which investments I should invest in. Um, I going to do through savings plan. Um, I going thio have some kind of rs benefits and contribute money to that. Um, I'm gonna invest in stocks. The Navy has many resources that can help you with making the correct decision returning concerning retirement. But if you're listening to this and you're in the military, you should already be thinking about retirement."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What benefits should people take advantage of more?,"I think the main benefits that, uh, people don't take advantage of if they're in the military. Um, number one. While you're active duty, you should definitely go to college. And you should definitely start, Um, um, putting money in stocks and there are people out there that can give you the tools for that after you get out of the service. I heard that, Um, yeah, only a small portion of people take advantage of their educational benefits. Many people who like toe give it thio their their family members just because they don't use it or they just let it disappear. Um, I think there's some, uh, law in Congress that allows you to have it indefinitely, which is really good. But even though you have it, um, and you don't use it, um, that's that's, I think, a shame that more people should take advantage off"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How is travel paid for? (as part of job duties),"personally, I love traveling in the Navy. I didn't really get to travel, do the work while I was on active duty. But as a reservist, we travel all the time. In fact, we travel every single year, so they could send me from my home in Los Angeles, toe Norfolk. And once I get to Norfolk, the flight there is paid for, Um, you can stay at a hotel, you get a certificate of non availability, which means that you can stay at any of the hotels off base or if they have government hotels on base. Then you get to stay at a nice hotel and with with maid service and breakfast, most likely they even pay for your car. So as long as you keep the receipts or you type it in tow the website, um, the travel website, Then for the most part, um, once you get back home, they'll give you the cash right there on the spot. Sometimes you're there, you're traveling and you need some cash. Uh, that shouldn't come from your normal paycheck. Uh, then you actually write a write request and they give you advanced pay. So basically, you don't have to really worry about money when you're traveling as long as like you write the correct paperwork. Um, it should all be free and paid for by the military."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What kind of hobbies do you have time for?,"My hobby is generally very based on my age. I used to play basketball a lot, especially on the naval base is, uh, pool and bowling, You know, they're always so cheap and so abundant. But recently I found myself shooting, archery and playing video games, those of the main things that I do now."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"As a single person, who do you rely on most for support?","I only split my life up in the, uh, two separate camps. There's the academic, um, environment, in which case, like, I have so many like, um, mentors and teachers that I could go to, especially when I am having difficulty difficulties with my studies, Um, and then my personal life. I have my roommate upstairs. He's really great, you know, his father and her husband, and, you know, he gives me lots of advice on those things as well."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Why didn't your marriage work out? Why did you divorce?,"my marriage didn't work out for the same reason that I think it doesn't work out for a lot of, uh, new people in the Navy. Number one. I didn't really understand what the purpose of a marriage was for. Um, I I know there's a really cheesy thing to say, but, I mean, I have my father, my mother, and they divorced when I was young, so my mother kind of just took care of me. So my impression of what family waas was based on, uh, my mother, my sister who is 10 years older than me and her three kids. And it's a group of people that kind of take care of each other. Uh, maybe some people work and then they put money into the house. Maybe someone has a car, and then they drive people around. Um, maybe people laugh and joke, you know, you go to these places and that's what my impression of marriage waas Um, it's a group of people, um, dealing with family issues. But that's not the right reason to get married. I got married really young, um, in my eyes 24 years old. And I found this, uh, this gorgeous model. Uh, she was my, um I lived with her for several years after I split up with my father. I was 18 years old. I bounced around from house to house, and eventually I moved in with my best friend. And, um, like, just staying with that whole entire family for years, One year, two years, uh, hanging out with the kids and the family and the, you know, going toe all these barbecues. And, you know, you develop a love for everyone in the house. You develop a love of strong connection. And I thought that that was, uh, a good way to make a family. However, when I eventually asked the like, my best friend at the time, she was my best friend to be married. I didn't think about her as you know what? Like I'm going to get old and die with this person. I was just thinking, You know what? Like she supported me, I support her. Um, let's just do it. Um, but yeah, months go by and weeks go by and you don't develop the same type of love that should be in a marriage. Uh, you should wanna call back, for instance, I'm unemployment. Um, I should really wanna call back very often to the home. And I was just so involved with work. Um, really, if I would've looked around to my left and my right, There are many husbands who would stand in line for, like, four hours, five hours just to call back to their to their wife. And that wasn't me. And I should have, you know, I should have actually, like, been in more contact with my wife to make it less, and I didn't. When she's asking me for money, I would be thinking, Well, you know, like, I'm the one who joined the service and this money, it actually belongs to me. You know, it's It's my cash. I'm working for this, you know, And that's actually the wrong way to think about it. You should think every single dollar that comes to me should be split around, you know? So I was very selfish at the time as well. Um, yeah, I could go on with a lot of the reasons that I'm I was a bad person to be a husband to at the time. Um, I think now, maybe I'm ready. Every single dollar and make should go to my kids in my family. Um, every single free time that I have each our free time that I have should go to my friends and family. And I just didn't think that at the time, um, she had her, um, her items of concern as well, you know, like, but I'm not her and yeah, it just didn't work out."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How it is like being a step dad?,"for me. It, um, being a stepped out just came really, really easily. When I started living with my wife, she was actually pregnant, and she broke up with her boyfriend. So I was there when, um when her her daughter was born and that daughter, like, really grew on me. That's one of the reasons that we got married in the first place. Um, having the kid, you know, changing diapers and putting around my arm going to Seaworld with them. You know, you you really get thio to feel that even though you didn't conceive the child that, like, there's someone out there in the world who needs me, who wants me, who says that they love you. Um, and as long as like, you don't get too hung up on the biological aspect of it. Um, you really you really, really grow on you"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Do you still keep in touch with your prior step kids?,"for the longest time. Especially after we, um we were divorced. I did try to keep some contact, but I I did eventually realized that that might not be the best way to go forward. Um, she was trying to make her life. I understand that, like her new husband was was very, um, maybe jealous of me. Or we had some kind of conflict. And to keep that relationship going knowing that I was, uh, involving stress in your life. It just didn't seem wise to me, because there there are other people out there, and sometimes you just have to know window, um, cut it off and start fresh."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How do I keep a good budget?,"the best budget that you can have is, ah, one that you start off with some of the basic materials. Well, everyone needs off cell phone, gas insurance, um, decent amount of food. Once you have that, then you slowly start to build up the rest of it until you get Thio the salary that you're looking for. The salary that that you're looking for is about, um, 70 to 80% off of your your monthly salary. That's the kind of, uh, version that I took on. You don't wanna be hitting your, you know, like, if you make 5000 don't wanna be, uh, be hitting 5000 every single month. So there's some kind of buffer is gonna change based on who you are and what kind of goals you're looking for. Maybe you're trying to buy a house. Then you should have a bigger buffer. Maybe you're just trying to buy another car. Smaller buffer. Maybe you said, hey, you know what? Like I'm not gonna retire or, uh, save for another couple of years. Then you know, you know, have at it. But once once you have that goal, uh, then you make the rest of your buffer based on your excess and your basic necessities"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Are you happy with your job?,"being electrician's in the Navy has give me a lot of opportunities to see things, to understand things I would have never thought about before. I mean, um, learning some physics in college, I learned about, um, current and voltage and electrons. And, um, even going through the new power school program gave me a really big perspective on life. Learn about he transfer fluid flow, chemistry, lots of things. Um, now that I'm in the computer science field in my college, I would prefer that my naval career, um, kind of match that as well. So right now I'm trying to switch careers to b'more I t related."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How can your work change the world?,"When you talk about the way that my work can change the world, you have to look at it. Um, with the broad lynch, I'm in the military and the military's job is thio police, the world basically, of course, American citizens and to make sure that we maintain our quality of life. But, um, there are many other countries that can't defend themselves and a zoo long as you go in with the right mindset, you know, trying to do the right thing, then help those guys out when they wouldn't be able to defend themselves. Otherwise, that's that's also like, um, very honorable, I think ast faras being a nuke. Um, basically, we were an operator for the most, for the most part. So we get our pilots to the middle of the Pacific Ocean, and those pilots are the ones who actually, um, defend the country and do the attacking where it's needed for our marines. So, um, it feels good to be a part of that support role. Um, right now I'm in the Naval Postgraduate School and I'm studying cybersecurity. I have a focus on research, so I'm hoping that some of the things that I'm learning. The two years that I'm gonna be here is going to combine with the thesis that I'll do and maybe the research, um, job that I'll have later on so that we have better, uh, cryptography or we have, um ah, more robust I t network infrastructure. I'm not exactly sure how I'm going to make my mark in the cybersecurity world, but I'm learning the things that it takes and I'm trying toe, you know, put myself in the position toe change the world on a global scale."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What is the most important lesson about life you have learned?,"The most important thing I've learned about life is something that I always took for granted. I grew up with, ah, strong family, their cousins, their aunts, grandmothers, my mom and my dad and even a brother. But slowly, I have actually siphon them all off. And right now, I don't really have a strong family network that I could talk to right now. I thought, Well, you know what? I'll make a family later on in the future. And here I am past my forties, and I still, um, don't have a wife, don't have any kids. And I've been focused so much with work that I've actually forgotten the things that are most important, which is developed, that family structure. It's been around me. I knew that it existed, but maybe I never found the right one. I used to be married before, and it was to the wrong person. I used to have girlfriends that were the right people, but I didn't, you know, take the take the bait. And here I am, you know, like ah kind of kind of alone. And I think that it's important for me to find someone for me to make my mark for me to have a kid that I can, you know, pass my legacy on to for me to have a wife that I can grow old with and make sure that in your naval career you don't forget those things. And that's one of the main things that you're fighting for your fighting. For others, it's true. But don't forget yourself in that others mix."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What makes you proud?,"The thing that makes me most proud is when others tell me how I help them and that can come in multiple forms. When I'm at a local restaurant and it's Veterans Day and someone buys me a beer, they say Thank you for service, Um, that that really gets me because, like, I do realize that, um, that's not just, um speaking from nothing. They know that I actually went halfway around the world and I was fighting for their rights to be free, fighting for their rights toe so that they could enjoy this life, and it's tough. Some of us were in danger there, especially like soldiers on the ground who were shot. And we put ourselves through that and we come back for him to acknowledge that that makes me very proud."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How and where do you find inspiration?,"I find inspiration from a lot of different avenues. Um, sometimes it's the people that I'm around. Um, sometimes it's especially friends when they're when they're successful, in their own jobs or in their own school. Um, but to tell you the truth, my biggest inspiration comes from the past historical feature. Historic historical figures. I have been learning about Albert Einstein recently, Isaac Newton. Some of the scientists that have pushed forward quantum mechanics and quantum computing. Um, those guys, you realize that for the vast majority of of their life, they're just normal guys. They have a wife and kids and they watch TV just like us. They go out and buy pants and clothes and hats, but, you know, for ah, section of their life, they actually really put forth their full effort. They read the books that it takes. They talk to the people, they do the math, Um, and and it's not normal, you know? That's what did you do for this Friday? Well, I was watching Netflix and some kind of YouTube movies, but what they did was they. They pushed themselves forward to the limits of human understanding, and then they made their own mark, and those are the type of people that I find inspiration from the people that are changing the world."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What keeps you up at night?,"the things that keep me up at night are the things that I find myself most scribbling down on a sheet of paper, which is what my job is gonna be two years from now. Right now, I don't know. I'm a crypt, um, a cyber security analyst at the Naval Postgraduate School. And eventually we're gonna have to have a job. Maybe it's gonna be in research. Maybe I'll be working for NASA. Maybe some federal job in Japan. Who knows where it's going to be. But until I have that job, you know the job. That's gonna pretty much dictate the rest of my life. Um, it's kind of like, uh, not worrying a little bit exciting, but it's the thing that keeps me up at night."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What has been your greatest success?,"my greatest success has been when I was accepted to U C. Berkeley. That's when I started going to college and I put forth the effort and I actually applied once and I was rejected. Um, I don't think that I had all the classes that you needed to take, but the point is, I didn't really push myself as hard as I wanted to a Zai did in the Navy. Um, I think I had, like, a 3.7 or 3.6 or something like that. And, um, I applied and the rejection letter came. And, um, that's basically the main school that I wanted to go to this whole entire time. So rather than give up, Um, actually, I stayed another year, make sure that I finished all the classes that were required, which was a big one. I found out later, Um, but I made sure that I got, like, a basic 4.0, that I did an internship that that I started to cross off all the t's and dot all the I's that it takes to get there. And that acceptance letter came and I was ecstatic about that"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How do you define success?,"I define success as having a challenging goal put before you that takes, you know, either a small amount of time or a large amount of time. But, um, it's not easy. You actually have toe, you know, like, challenge yourself to achieve that goal. And once you do, then, um, you know, that's your success."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What is the advancement potential in the field? What is a typical path?,"foreign electrician's for active duty. You tend to do your first two years of school. That includes electrical training and learning about how the nuclear, uh, nuclear reactor works on how to become an operated for it. Um, the next four years should be spent on a ship. Now, that's just basically, uh, understanding how to do the technical aspect of it. Um, you're gonna be, uh, third class petty officer, second class petty officer, um, down there in the plants, Um, sometimes in the bills sometimes, um, working in, uh, in close operating station with, uh, watch upside down That's down there sometimes just going from level to level level, um, looking at pumps and valves and gauges. And, uh, you know, the fixing things, doing preventive maintenance after you become a first class petty officer, then you've done that for the most part, and you're kind of supervising people. Um, you do that for about a couple of years, So you're at about your eight year mark, maybe even nine year mark, that you've been doing that Not only have you been a first class petty officer who who's been training people, but you've also had other experiences you've been maybe the training pitch officer, which, um, has a job of showing people all of the tech manuals and what's inside the tech manuals and how to read things from the tech manuals and doing power power Point presentations on some equipment that they've never seen before. You know, that's when you kind of like extend, um, how our extended learning that we've done. Um, there's like three m co ordinator, where you and three in coordinator is not just a job for just Electrician's. It's like for for all the rates. And that's where you, um, make sure that all of the all of the work is done in accordance with some procedure, according Thio, whatever equipment you're supposed to be working on, so, um yeah, I'll leave it alone. But the point is, you go from job to job to job a za first class. So you have a really good perspective of the whole entire ship. Um, thing you might become a chief, And once you becoming chief, you actually start talking to the officers a lot more. It's kind of like your world kind of flips up. Um, you can think of it like a like one of those. Our glasses and the first class and the chief are kind of like in the middle. And once you become a chief, you still have to talk to the unit, Um, some. But it's more about telling the first class what he supposed to do. He filters it down, and then the first class tells you and then you filter it up. So that's when you start becoming more administrative oriented. You tell the watch officer, um, what's going on the plant? What maintenance is being performed? Um, And in the unit, you, uh, make sure that everybody is on track to become promoted toe. Make sure that they're on track tow, cover all of their watches. And if there's some kind of problem with that, then you can you can you address it seeing chiefs and master chiefs. They're a little bit more specific. Um, so if you become a senior chief, you do a lot of the things that a chief also does. But you also have a little bit more on career progression. Um, instead of being a three m coordinator, you could be, um, someone who is in charge of entire departments. Not just your unit, a senior chief, because they expect you toe, of course, no electric, uh, electrician's stuff as a senior chief. But they also expect you to be very familiar with the e t stuff. Elektronik technician and very familiar with the mechanical stuff. Maybe you also qualified. Watch Super. Um, work center supervisor. I'm sorry, What supervisor and work center supervisor Where? Um, you actually have to understand the plant way more in depth. You could probably even write books about it, right? Procedures about it. Um, Master Chief, that's the highest that you could be the highest level that you could be, um, in the military. That's a level of e nine. And that's when you are so for the nukes, like they do have a they can't have a master chief that's in charge of the whole entire electrical department. But there's another master chief that's in charge of the whole entire nuclear section and even another master chief. They're all e nine who is in charge of the whole entire ship, and you could be either one of those. Um, it's more like lateral transfers when you're at that level, so yeah, to become a chief and might take about 10 years to become seeing chief could be like 12 or 13. To become a master chief, you could be pushing around 20 years at that time."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What is a good strategy for setting goals and priorities to advance?,"a good goal is toe. Go online, figure out your advancement path and make sure that you're checking all the boxes that it takes Thio get to the next level. So, for instance, for first class Petty Officer as an electrician's, um, they expect you to be a leading chief petty officer. Or at least, um, and assistant leading Petty officer. Other jobs could be training pair, officer, quality, quality assurance person or three m co ordinator. There are many jobs that you can do at that level. Make sure that you either do one job really well. Eso you really appeal for a long time or you have lots of experience doing all the other jobs eso they that you have a broad range of what they do. So what you don't want to do is, uh, keep doing the second class job that you were doing before, and there's a lot of opportunity for that. You might become promoted, and they're not going to switch you overnight. So if you wanna be promoted, um, faster to the next level, just say, Hey, you know what? I was a second class. I was a technical person. I was going down there in the in the in the turbine generators and opening up cleaning things, and they allow you to do that. But they really look highly on the people who stop doing that. Figure out what the first classes are supposed to be doing. Um, if they're gonna be leading the whole entire unit of, like, let's say 15 people and start doing it immediately, Um, start seeing what the chief does and saying, and you have to say, Hey, you know what? Is there something that I could do to help you out with that? Yeah, sure. Take these papers or Yeah, sure. This is the qualification, Um, of this unit. Make sure that they're all at, you know, 90% or greater a songs. You start taking on the role of the next level above you, or at least like being very, very proficient at the job that you're supposed to be. Um, then you can start doing those things earlier rather than later."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What are the most important things on a resume?,"the most important things on a resume. Our the things you put down for your experience, we want to be really concise. We want you to say that you worked at this unit or this shop on this ship and maybe like two or three, um, lines about, like a concisely what you did. Um, And the longer that is, the better it is. So one thing I have to say is, um let's say for me I was on, uh, the USS John C. Stennis and I was on there actually longer than I should have been. I did a six year tour. So for my block, it's gonna say USS John C. Stennis for six years. And of course, I did multiple things on there. Um, I was three and coordinator. I was, uh, lpo of of another unit. I was I covered all of the watches, but in the end, it's just ah, paragraph. You know, maybe a long paragraph. But it's just 11 in general, so it's better to have multiple ships. Um, the more things that you can do them or training that you can do if you could get a C school in there. That's going to be another block. If you can stand a watch for another unit, that's gonna be another block. If you can qualify, uh, something that's out of your rate rather than become propulsion Electrician's let's say for like three years, um, split it up, say, Propulsion Electrician's for a year and a half and then, hey, you know what? Like let me try to qualify what works in a supervisor instead, and that's gonna be another block. So you're talking about quantity over the quality of the job because the quality in the Navy, they expect you to be proficient, vastly proficient at your job. So the longer you do it, it doesn't count. You have to, like, take something and then keep moving."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Where can a person get access to a new role that will help me advance?,"If you're looking for a new role to help you advance, you have to make sure number one that it's in your field. You could do tons of jobs around this ship, but if it's not in your field, then it's not gonna quite help you so much. So I think the main source is probably gonna be your chief. Uh, he's gonna tell you, or she will tell you, um, the rules that are available. And sometimes there are things that you don't even no pertain to your rate. One for me was three. M coordinator. I didn't realize that that was a job that a new could take on, but it's a high, high, high position job. Another one that was hidden from me that was going on behind the scenes was, uh, the Tech Pub Library, the Technical Publications library. And you have to be really on familiar with all of the books that are associated with the nuclear field. And you have to know, like where they're supposed to be located. Um, and you also help out when people are doing research. They say, Hey, you know what? Like there's this schematic that I need you should be able toe, you know, find which book it's in and do some of the basic research for him for that. And that's another thing that can promote you. So, um, your chief and other supervisors in your chain of command can actually, like, point you out to some of these jobs that can kind of, like might be something different than what you're used to but might be hidden from you or might be useful in ways that you didn't know about before."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Who are all the people I should talk to before making a major career choice?,"the ones you mainly want to focus on when you're talking about, like a choice that can really, um, disperse you out to many different places is number one, your family. If you have ah, wife or husband back home, um, it's gonna really uplift their career. You have to make sure that the thing that you're trying to do doesn't conflict with their own personal job. Um, with your kids, uh, they tend to be a little bit more flexible, but make sure that you're not disrupting their life too much. You know, they have a career that they're trying thio to make for themselves, you know, as far as like, their school and their grades. Maybe they don't wanna, like, go to another school just yet. Ah, lot of people. And you might think that that's trivial. But I found especially in Japan Ah, lot of people, like, stay at a certain place or extend their careers even longer based on their kids finishing school at a specific high school. Um and yeah. So make sure you put your family number one, uh number two. You want thio? Talk to people in the in your chain of command who might have experience with the place that you're going. One place I was considering going was, um, going to be thio the ship a submarine tender in Italy. Now I was told that it was gonna be in Guam, and I was prepared toe like, go to that place. But they actually, like, changed their spot and they were in Italy at the time, or it might have been vice versa. And so you think that you might be going toe certain ship, but in reality, you don't know what's actually happening. You don't know the mission of that ship. You don't know the type of job that you're doing on that ship. So the more information that you get from online from other people who have been on the ships from your supervisors, the better and more informed. Um um, answer that you could give yourself to make sure that it's the right decision for you"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Who gave you the best advice about your career?,"the people that gave me the best advice about my career. Um, isn't actually just one specific person. It's a group of people. When I became a chief, um, I went through the indoctrination process, which is, ah, couple of month long tour that they send you through. They teach you all the books that you're supposed to read. They make sure that you have some kind of basic understanding about all the procedures and the admin requirements that are that are that are necessary. But throughout the whole entire process, um, in bits and pieces the Chiefs would actually like give me a little piece of pieces of advice to help me in my career. One person was really good at y and stuff, and he showed me, um uh, kind of like like the path that he took and some of the problems that he was going through. Another electrician's kind of help me with some of the background information about, um, about yeah, training myself and my crew on balking about the surge Main unit like how could help them, you know, become better themselves. There's so many, like, um, small pieces that I guess a group of 30 chiefs gave me during that indoctrination time that I really think, you know, I consider as a whole. You know, the chiefs and Doc process help me out a lot."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,In what ways would your career have benefited from better advice?,"When I first joined the military, I actually wanted to be a cryptologic technician. And instead of taking the test, I think there's this test called the D lab that you, uh, takes about an hour or two. And they, um they tell you if you can learn a foreign language or not, rather than give me that test, they actually had to take the nuclear test. And because I did really well at that test, they kind of pushed me into that, um, that field. I don't think it was the field that I was, um, mainly interested in, and in fact, like I was kind of anti engineering at the time. It worked out for me. In the end, I'm glad that I had all of the experience that I that it wanted to with it. But I think if I would have went to cryptologic route, um, that lifestyle, I think, would have been more in line with what I was joining the Navy for, and I think I would have benefited from a little bit of help in determining, like how I could get into that field from the get go"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How can I tell who I can really rely on?,"you can tell who you can really rely on based on two things. Number one, they're experience. If they have a long history of actually doing right things, um, then you can tell who the superstars of every unit are gonna be. And number two, um, as a result of that, as a consequence of that, what people are saying about them Hey, you know what? Um, you just came into the unit. You should go talk to X, Y and Z. You'll always get that. Um, it's, uh, From what I've understood, it's mostly been some kind of first class from some kind of hotshot first class whose, uh, checked all the boxes, and you can really get a lot of critical information from the superstars."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What advice did you listen to from others that helped you advance?,"one of the best piece of information that I got waas when people would always tell me, Hey, you know what? Like find your bibliography and mainly read those chapters before I had never really picked up a bibliography, which is, Ah, a list of books that are required reading for your promotion. When you take the test, they take out little snippets of it or chapters from it. And then, um, they transcribe those into questions on I think they're like 200 questions or something that's supposed to fill out before that, I just thought, Well, you know, like I'm Electrician's, it's my whole entire career. Yeah, you're not supposed to go back and memorize those things. You just, ah, part of you. But, um, the bibliography is, like, really, really shaved down. And, um, it's something that you can study over the course of a few days Ah, week. Or for more hardcore members, you know, an entire month. But it's not. It's not so difficult to actually get into the books and read. So the fact that they gave me the opportunity Thio find out about that material and the fact that they pushed me to learn that material is something that I really appreciate"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What advice did people tell you that you wished you had heeded?,"For the most part, I'm pretty satisfied with the way that my active duty career went. I went to the ship that I wanted to go to some place in San Diego, and I'm from California. It's where my family was. So I'm glad I got that. I went upto Washington, and, you know, it wasn't a choice of, uh, ships we were actually like I moved there because of a ship swap. But, um, yeah, there's no choice with that. And then and then I got out. Um, but two years before I actually got out of the service at my six year point, you're supposed to actually do short command, and I've never experienced a short command before. I had only been on a ship at that time and, um, the recruiter actually said, Hey, you know what? Like we have some opportunities for you, you could become an instructor in New York or he actually gave me the opportunity to go to ah submarine tender in Italy slash Guam. And I didn't do either one of those. And he was kind of pushing forward the benefits of both. You know, if I was an instructor, that would have, you know, actually patted my resume a lot. It's actually in a field education field. Um, that that I'm doing right now, which I really wish was on my resume. Um, at this time, Um, and if it wasn't that, then it would have been going toe Italy. Like I would have loved him. Italy, I think. You know, I always wanted to go to Europe, and I actually jumped over that opportunity to, you know, experience that foreign country. Uh, because, uh, yeah, it wasn't the exact specific place that I wanted to go to, so I wish I would have listened to him at the time. And, you know, further my naval career."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What question have I not asked you that I should have asked you?,"you could have asked me about my interaction with other branches of service. For me, the answer is I experienced ah, little bit off communication with some of the Marines, especially when we're on deployment. Um, and every now and then I go up to some of the Air Force bases and occasional army bases. Uh, that's when I had actually see them and kind of realized, Hey, every place is not just the navy, but yeah, depending on what your rate is like, you interact with other people a lot more, especially if you're in the medical field. I think, you know, like all the services if your hospital Corman, but, yeah, other service, other branches of service to exist and we don't interact with them slightly."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Should I go to college now or after serving?,"college is one of the main reasons that I joined the military service. And if you think that you're gonna have the naval, um, the naval profession be your your main career, then I would suggest going to college as soon as possible, even while you're in, preferably before, but, um, sometime, Um, after, uh, after you, after you join, based on some of the free education that you get on and try to become an officer. If that's your thing, um, they have a longer career, spanned, maybe upto 30 years. Um, yet I think a wider range of professions, Um, plus, maybe you joined the service when you were younger. You didn't really know what you wanted to do, and you might be in a profession that, um, you could enjoy. But you could also want experience, different things. I think officers have a much wider range of things that they can do. You can still do the same rate that you are that you're in. There are many nukes that continue to be nukes afterwards. But if you're an officer, yeah, you have the chance toe, um goto many more places to be in a higher responsibility profession, I think eso you you consider? Um, Officer, if you were, if you had a degree during the time now, you could be like me, which is use the profession of the naval profession as a way to get your education. And in that case, I would say you go to school after you get out. Now, um, for me, I stayed in the Navy Reserve, and that really worked really, really good with with going to school. Um, I did my six years active. I took a few classes online. Um, I think I had, like, three or four classes that that I was attempting, at least. And then at the end of eight years, um, after joining the Navy Reserve, I I was in school for full time, basically for the I guess the last, like, eight years or so. I did my undergrad and I did a master's. And I'm currently, um, still in the Navy Reserve and still getting my masters. And I think that freedom that you have without worrying about full time work, uh, is really beneficial, Especially if you want to do really good at your at your at your, um, class in your classes"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What range of tasks and opportunities does this field present to allow me to grow?,"the range of opportunities that you have, like, uh, they can come in the form of actual work that you do on the ship. So there are many jobs that you can do. You can become works in a supervisor. You could become low dispatcher for electrician's anyways, Proportion Electrician's. You can have all those normal watch stations, but you can also extend yourself throughout. The ship is, Well, um, you could become, Let's say, um, surface where or fair qualifier. Which means that you know exactly how the surface ship works for the engineering department, and you can train other people like, for instance, cooks and boatswain's mates. You know how your service works. Uh, that's another thing you can put on your on your resume. Soto be able to do that to be able to train other people like that. That's, uh, one way that you can expand your career. You can also go to school. Um, everyone goes to a school, at least for uh, if they're a nuke. But there are other schools, like a C school, and there's a long list of schools that you could get from the Web that that you can go to you could go toe school as long as there is a freedom in your department. You could go to school every other year if you wanted Thio. Um, once you get out, then obviously, you know, you can use your Montgomery job Little benefits. Or I guess it's post 9 11. Now that you can, you know, go toe, go to school and take educational classes. You can also do that if you're an active duty member as well. I did that as well. I think I took two classes. Calculus, um, and in English. But I must admit, it is a little bit harder with, ah, full time work."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What leaders do you look up to for guidance?,"in my career. I think I find that every single block above me is a leader that I look up to. The main one that I have is, let's say, the Devo, um uh, the devil could actually be a young person, maybe just two years in, but they've given been, given the responsibility to look after the unit, and they've proven that they can. They've been given the commission, and for the most part, like like they take it on full charge. And they have a lot of interesting things that they could tell you toe s O that you could grow as a person as well. Um, a little bit above that is the Chang the chief engineer? Um, that's for normal surface ships. I just came back where we had an awesome chang. Who? I think she was a mechanic, but she had a, ah, large understanding of the way the entire plant worked. And I got a lot of information from her on a aircraft care. You have the reactor officer whom I didn't experience s o much, but I still look to them as a leader because you could not tell that they were not the captain of the ship the way they move, the way that they talked the way that they carried themselves. Um, everything that they did was very, very disciplined and organized. And you knew that nothing on that ship would be wrong if they were in charge. That's the way that they carried themselves. Um above them is the CNO and then the president. I like to them a lot less. Obviously, you know, they have the whole entire, um, service to run. However, they are our commanders and chiefs. So whatever they're doing, you have to make sure that they're leading by example. Um, you filtered that down to the troops. So if they're saying, hey, you know what? We have to go to this area and these are the reasons, you know, you have to take that on, and you have to, like, present that presidential atmosphere to the rest of the unit. Um, of course, it could be a little bit political when you're talking about you know, the president less political when you're talking about the CNO. You know this, you know, has mainly one idea for everyone and depending on in for the president, depend on whether it's a Democrat or Republican or some other party like, um, it might be hard Thio get completely behind all of their words. But, um, those are the things that you focus on. You focus on the mission, the mission of the ship, the mission of your aircraft here, and yeah, you should. And I think most military people do have the impression that he is our leader. And he's the example that, um, that we're following. So yeah, from the president all the way down, toe the chief right beside me. You look toe everybody around you, all your leadership, Um, for that for that experience."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What opportunity would I have to change careers/fields?,"getting into a different field is something that I wish I would have known Maura about before I joined the, uh, field that I went in. I'm happy with being electrician's, but I did think coming in that you did have more opportunity to do different things. I thought maybe one day I could be in Germany doing X and another time being in the bottom of Africa. Doing why, um, as an electrician's, you know, I thought, Okay, well, sure, I'll be, um, taking voltage on these pumps. But I thought it could, You know, every place has electrician's, uh jobs associated with it, so I thought I could be associated with any of them. But that's actually not true. Um, for me, we have the submarines that we could go to and the aircraft carriers that we could go to, and those are the main places. You have a little bit more freedom when you're talking about the short commands that you could go to, um, because we don't just want you always focus on these three ships all the time, so it's kind of like it's not a vacation, but it's more like a different work environment. so that we're not, like, so focused on just electrical things. But those short commands are few and far between hope for the majority of your work, you're expected to kind of, like fall within the field. If you're an officer, then you have a lot more choices. You can do some kind of lateral transfers, but as far as the enlisted side, you're mainly stuck with the field that you're, uh, that you've been trained to do. Now. If you wanted to do something else, you could force yourself into it. So, for instance, you could go to several schools, Um, a songs. You have your main career set. You know, I'm electrician's. I did. I went to electrical schools. I could also learn, Let's say, for instance, I'm, um I could go to a chemical school where if I learned that that rate and that school and those those tools, then I can start doing those jobs. It's not a lot more, but it is something toe. If you're If you don't wanna keep doing your same job"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How can I request to work in a certain area or field?,"Well, things change all the time. But currently there is this, um, website that you can go on. It's called CMS I d. That gives you a list of opportunities that are currently available. I think, uh, it's changing. It might be my navy assignments right now, but any other case, it's, uh there's always a website you can go on that you put in your information you put in your past and you put in the things that you know about your things that you're an expert on, and then they kind of match. You doesn't have to exactly match your rate, but, um, it should be in the same general feel if you're doing electric. Um, if you have an electrical rate, you can do some kind of engineering job, so it might be a mechanical. It might be a neat job, but a so long as you have some kind of experience with it, um, you have a little bit of freedom toe get those jobs based on the website based on what they need"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How much value does your organization put on education and training?,"the value that my my organization puts on education kind of various, depending on what rank you are when you're kind of in the younger sections. Maybe like a third class or second class. It's something that me as a chief, I actually, like, take down If you've got all things being the same If you were ableto take college class or two, um, compared to other people in the unit, then ideo give you Ah, a bump on that on your evaluation Later on, you'll find that many chiefs already have their A's, Their bachelors, um, someone even have master's degrees. It doesn't necessarily have to do specifically with advancement, but you kind of see that the the more responsibility you take on yourself to get education, the more people think of you in general. Um, for awards, though, for instance, for sale of the quarter, Uh, there is a block on there that says, um, hey, they completed their education requirements, um, such as, like they have your bachelor's or the masters, and it does give you a few points. Also, for your advancement exams, there's there's a part on there where, um, that deals with education as Well, if you wanted to keep going and let's say you want to become an officer, then you definitely need at least a bachelor's degree in orderto apply unless you're trying to become a chief warrant officer."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How do the educational benefits of the military work?,"I was really fortunate. Thio take part in mainly all of the ways that the maybe give you, um, educational opportunities. When I was on my ship actually took two classes. I took a calculus class and in English class for Free Aceh, Long as it was after working hours. Um, while I was on deployment, which was great, I actually went thio several schools. They send, you know, to a two week school or even a month long school. I got advanced electrical, um, knowledge based on, uh, those many schools that I went to, uh, when I became a reservist, they actually, like, send me the other schools as well. There, too. You do your annual training, which is two years. Uh, I'm sorry to two months that two weeks that you go out and you do your your normal training. But then they provide opportunities to go to schools, uh, ranging anywhere from two weeks or two months or, um or even longer so that you can put adventure. Your professional career also did, uh, the Montgomery G I. Bill and the 9 11 bill. I had the opportunity to experience both of them. Uh, the G I Bill, they just gave you money based on whether you're in college or not. And the 9 11 bill, they actually, like, pay you, um, your living expenses and your tuition it as well as some book fees. So they break it down a little bit more. But I think that actually, uh, end up giving you more money as well. So those are all the ways that I found? Um, you can have, um, educational benefits through the navy. There are a lot more."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How will my experience transfer to civilian jobs outside of the Navy?,"This is ah, really complex question. It really depends on what you've done for your career, how broad it was and mainly what job you expect to have once your complete as an electrician's. Um, of course, I'm gonna have that, uh, eight years that I had and there's so many things that that go into it. There's the schooling that I had there the you know, grad level, um, classes that I took during my school. Um, there's the extra classes that I took while I was on my ship there. The college classes that I took while I was on my ship. And toward the end of my career, I had all of that supervisory, um, supervisory roles that I could also put, um, saying that I had experience with. So if I got a job as a nuclear operator at the end, all that years, all of those years would contribute to getting that, uh, that job. I have eight years off doing that job. However, if I chose to change my career, which is exactly what I did then I don't have to throw all of those away, But I can't really, um, depend on the the nuclear aspects of it. I'm a computer scientist. I'm in the i t field, so they don't really care that I know how toe do, uh, how to change pumps or how toe check voltage that that doesn't really apply toe apply to that. But what they do care about is, um, the leadership roles that have had the fact that I'm a veteran the fact that I can actually teach myself the fact that I did two years off training in the in the most difficult, um, things that you can imagine as an American. Um, all of that kind of gives me a bump up. Um, but yeah, you just have to make sure that it relates to the job that you're gonna get, um, once you get out"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Who has influenced you the most?,"I've been influenced by so many people throughout my naval career. It's not just one but several dozen who have give me leadership opportunities who have provided feedback on how I'm treated, how I'm treating my people, how I'm treating my career. But I think the the most influential person would be some of the friends that I've had, uh, coming through coming through a school and onward to my next ship. I have one particular friend. Uh, he went through the whole entire, um, to your school with me, and I went to the my first ship, USS John C. Stennis, And you followed behind me because I was there and all of the conversations that we had about what we're gonna do with our career where we're gonna go afterwards. What school we're gonna go to. You know, they were all influenced by bouncing off of each other. We eventually, like, uh, both switched over the computer science. We both eventually, like a even went to the same community college afterwards. So I think, uh, he gave me some really influential words toe work with while I was going through my naval career."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Tell me about a mentor that you have or had. How did that person positively influence your academic decisions?,"I just recently came from Assessable Japan. Um, I had never been a shipyard superintendent before, but they're one of the guys that actually has to understand the entire workings of the ship. And because I had only been in the proportion plants, for the most part, has an electrician's. Uh it was a really big task toe. Understand how how all of this worked? Um, what most reservists do and what even most like, uh, active duty people do once they first get there, they don't qualify shipyard superintendent so fast. And I was only there for four months. But I took it upon myself to say, You know what? Like let me start learning. I actually wanna, like, get that qualification, and it's a pretty big process. It could take half a year sometimes, and I want to do it in a shorter amount of time. Um, rather than, you know, like, say, maybe it's kind of difficult. He was all for it. Hey, gave me all of the materials to learn, and, um, he walked around with me, you know, talking about the ship. And hey gave me some shadow partners so that I could go along with them and start, you know, like getting my my watch. Um, my watch qualifications completed in a fast time. So I really appreciate the fact that he meant towards me, and he got got that really difficult qualification done in a really short amount of time."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Who is a person that you considered as a role model early in your life? How and why does this person impact your life?,"even before I joined the Navy, I really appreciated the tech guys there. The ones I can think of are, you know, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. Um, more recent ones like Elon Musk. I don't necessarily agree with them, Uh, personally, some of them can be, you know, really? You know, like, aggressive on. And I know that business can be cutthroat, but, um, I could get over those those parts. I really appreciate the fact that they had this really big, really strong challenge in front of them that not many people could do otherwise. And these were some of the people that you know that they would be successful regardless of what they did. Let's say they started writing a book, then you know that they write one of the best books you've ever read. If they were artists, then, you know, you know, that they would probably one of the most famous, uh, drawers that that ever drew, you know, like, whatever rule that they're associated with, uh, you can tell that it's about them as as people rather than the thing that they create. So I really appreciate those, um, those people for inspiring me to try to do that with myself."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How can you tell if someone will be a good mentor?,"you can tell if someone's going to be a good mentor by how much you see them interacting with other people, whether they're a good listener and whether their hands on. For the most part, I found that chiefs are really good about that When I'm down in the plant. If I'm, let's have a new guy, their third class, you know, working with another person, you know, trying to, you know, fix, fix, fix the breaker. If I look to my right, you know, see in the next room that there's a chief down there with his flashlight, um, talking and explaining has the procedure out saying, You know, pointing with his finger touch that do that. It's not like this. He puts the he puts the book down and he goes down there and he starts the process. Then he puts the picks the book back up and has the other person continue. The people that interact like that, those are the best mentors. So you try to find someone who's going to be very interactive, not just listening, but also, you know, like, um down there in physical person with doing the maintenance, then you know that they're going to be good to go"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"If I don't have a mentor, how can I find good one?","believe it or not, all of the good mentors are already known. Wherever you go, if you're a new check in, um, within the first week or two weeks, you could just ask and they'll say, Oh, yeah, you know who is good for you? And there's always, uh, someone's name that that they're gonna say there's always superstars that every command."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What is your plan to reach your career/life goal?,"I'll be honest right now. I don't exactly know. Um, the final destination, my life is headed, but I do have some paths. Maybe it's gonna be making my own business. Um, the business could be creating something. I'm a computer scientist, so maybe I could create an application. Um, maybe I could develop some type of school. Um, for instance, I'm studying cybersecurity right now. Maybe I could develop my own subjects security, business and just grow it. Who knows? I'm also trying to get into the federal government. So maybe I could scrap those personal business plans and just be the best federal person, federal government person. That could be. Now there's some places I could go. Let's say there's NASA. I could be, um, someone in charge of putting spaceships on Mars. And that would be a non honorable goal. Toby, apart off. Um, I could work for the Institute of Creative Technologies, which is the company the company that I'm working at right now that they make virtual virtual environments for education and training. That's something that I've always been interested in. Um, out of all of these goals, I think the most important thing is to focus on what's present. Um, what I'm presently doing. And that's just trying to be the best student that I could be at the Naval Postgraduate School, um, my subject to cyber security. So I have my goals in front of me. I take four classes, make sure that I do things now that I haven't done in the past, which means read the book from front to cover, whether it's requested or not, which means asking questions to the instructor's, which means which I hadn't done before. Which means conversing with my other peers, which, instead of like being so individual, I need to really, you know, get out there and see See how people solve these problems that are really difficult. So as long as like, for the next two years, um, I'm doing those jobs, though that work that it takes to be a really good student in one of those jobs. It doesn't matter which one a za long as it's challenging to me, um is gonna come into play, and hopefully I'll be successful with it at that time"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What happens when you separate from the military?,"Well, hopefully your separation is done on honorable terms. Now, assuming that you don't get discharged for, you know, like some kind of violation, then there to pass that you can go either. You separate completely. Um, yes, but let's say you do four years. You still have four more years to do your entire service. But those last four years, a kind of invisible. They just want you to be around in case there's a war or something like that. But for the most part, if you finish your active duty tour, uh, you still have a role to play in the Navy because you'll always be a veteran until the day that you die. So you take that on, you have to make sure that you always, um, upstanding. You don't wanna be involved in crime. You don't wanna be, uh, you don't wanna do anything that's gonna cause disgrace on the Navy, because you could be like 73 years old. If you do something wrong, guess what's going to be on that report. They're going to say he was a prior military servicemen or she was a prior military servicemen. And you don't want to cause that disgrace. So, um, you get out and just make sure that you maintain that military bearing from that point on, Otherwise you could be like me. I'm in the Navy reserves and I still continue that Navy tradition just in a minimized capacity. I still go on. I still put things uniform. I still, um, serve on some kind of ship or some kind of shipyard every year, um, in a fully naval capacity. But otherwise I just take advantage of my educational benefits, and I still make sure that I'm always have that military mindset with everything that I do."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"How important is it to have the right training, degree or experience?","Of course, this is a question that depends on what you're trying to do with it for the Navy. You don't need anything if you're trying to join the enlisted ranks. I didn't even have any idea about what electricity was basically on. My and I did just fine. Um, you can think of it just like preparation. The better you do at your degree, whether it's just a sheet of paper or you're really good student or you're like the most outstanding student, you know, those are all just preparation. Um, and just because it's preparation, um, you just realize you're going to get that preparation no matter what, just by being in the service. So even if you don't have the degree, you could just simply replace that with time and in, you know, like after two years or three years, you could basically have just as much knowledge as somebody with a degree. Eso yeah, it could give you a boost ahead in life, whether it's, ah, where you're working for the Navy or civilian job. But don't depend on your your degree. It's ah, it's It could give you some kind of opportunity to learn things that you wouldn't have learned otherwise. Um, for instance, I took English classes and critical thinking classes I took, um, you know, debate classes. But for the most part, those air just like internally, they increase my internal knowledge, but not necessarily my field."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What do you believe will be the most important factors that will shape your future?,"I think the two main things that are gonna shake my future well, I'll say three, um, number one. How hard I work for the next two years while I'm in this Masters program that I'm in right now. Um, the second thing is, what job is going to take me as soon as I'm done? It can range from anything from the National Security Administration to, ah, University to NASA. Who knows what is what's what's gonna happen. But I'm not in control of that. Um but I think probably the most important thing for me is who I'm going to meet for, uh, my my spouse. I'm looking at all the time, and I think I didn't realize how important was before, But I definitely realized, um, you know the person you're gonna wake up beside, where you're gonna have kids or not even whether I'm gonna buy a house and settle down in a city or not all those things depend on you know who I choose to live life with"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How do you continue to improve your skills during your career?,"Well, the main thing to realize is that you're not the first person doing your job. So for me, as a computer scientists and specifically a cyber security analyst, I have toe, make sure that there's I need to find the list of things that are required for me. Um, for me specifically, there's artificial intelligence. There's a graphics. There's cryptography. Um, there's penetration testing their these certificates that I need toe accomplish network plus, um, security. Plus, um, that I need to make sure that I have that list laid out for myself, and then I'm checking each of those green boxes. It's gonna vary depending on your job, but make sure that you have, ah, the list that you want and that the at the end of the list, you have those skills that it takes to get the job that you want"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How much of your free time do you spend learning new tasks?,"the task that I learned? Uh, well, it varies depending on what type of summer I'm having. If it's kind of an enjoyable summer in Japan, then almost zero, I get home and I get changed. Then I go out, drink some sake, eating yakitori, you know, experienced life with friends in a place that I'm then I'm at like like now I'm in Monterey and I don't really have that many friends, so that gives me a lot of opportunity for free time. I spend my time watching YouTube videos about getting certificates for my degree. I find myself like reading textbooks, so I'd say maybe a third of my time is spent doing extra material, not just wasting time, not just hanging out. Eso it depends on on where you are and and what you're doing. Otherwise, I wish I would have spent a lot more time developing my career when I was in Japan. In Japan, I just had my normal job, and then the time hits And then I come home and I kind of waste time. So I wish I would have spent that time. Um, maybe a third of my free time, uh, progressing my career, but it depends on how you feel and just make sure that you do have some years where you really involved in progress in your career."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What are you doing daily to ensure your growth and development continues?,"for me. I find that I've had a lot of free time. And I, uh I found myself watching these YouTube videos. I'm taking this Professor Messer, uh, cybersecurity course So I can get my cyber, my security plus, um, certificate because you're gonna help me in my my i t career. I also I'm doing this recording now, which is with the U S. C s Institute for Creative Technologies, which is, um, like a track for education and training, uh, that I wanna have for myself and for my resume. That, uh, is pushing me forward with that, um, at night time, I Before I go to sleep, I opened up my Nintendo DS. There's this Japanese course that I'm learning, uh, takes about half an hour that I do these little flash cars and, uh, kind of like, learn that Japanese, Um, uh, the Japanese software. I also, um I'm learning this games. Plus, James, Where, uh, this guy has shown me how to make a two D model in the unity engine s Oh, that's just kind of like practicing my C plus plus ability. So bits and pieces here. It's not standard everyday, but it's Ah, it's something that I find myself, uh, doing what I what? I want to take a break from Netflix."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How often do you receive recognition and advancement for contributions?,"as a chief, I find myself getting recognition all the time. Uh, many of the supervisors that I'm involved with they actually, like, you know, explain how how thankful they are to have me, um, in front of the crew. They actually tell me as well. But you will find, though, that as you get promoted, um, you're gonna find your you're opportunities to be recognized like that grow smaller and smaller. Um, you just find that once you make chief and above, that's just not necessary. That's not a requirement for your job. If you're gonna be promoted, it's going to be based on the work that you do. And it's basically maybe 80 90% of it. They just say, Who did you train? What did they do? And if they want an award, then you get promoted. So it's kind of an indirect, um, achievement When you when you when your unit is successful, when your first class, which is E six and below. Uh, then it is a little bit more individual. That's when they want you to ruin awards. That's when they want you to run, sailor. The quarter There's no sailor. The quarter for chief and above. I don't even think there's, um, something of the quarter for officers. It's just from first class and below. Uh, there's junior sailor quarter. There's blue jacket of the quarter. Uh, there's Navy calms and dams. I think I want to now that my last award at my last command. But I don't remember what it was for and, you know, thank you very much. I remember just doing the job A Z best as I could. But that's a side note, by the way. It's not something that I was working towards. I think most most leadership will tell you that."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How should you respond to a death on the ship?,"Whenever you find out about the death of the ship you have toe, make sure that you're saying things the right way in the right mood in the right tone. Um, of course, the family needs to be, um, be contacted. And they're they're the lines of communication for that, Um, but particularly for the ship, Uh, that person had friends. That person had close close contacts on the ship. And you have to make sure that, um, at that time, their well being is the most important thing. Um, the way you address the ship, you have to be a somber. You have to be in a somber mood. You have to make sure that, like, um, stay positive about their time on the ship. You never wanna speak poorly of someone who just passed away. Um, make sure that, like a we know that we always have a mission. You know, we have a mission, and that comes first so that you have to make sure that you can't really be dwelling on the death for such a long time. The people that need to get off the ship, you know, if if it comes to that, then they need to be, um, put off just to make sure that everyone else is safe. And the people that are on the that are still on the lines. You have to make sure that they could do their job effectively. Um, but keeping in mind like how that person died, make sure that that doesn't happen again. Especially if it was an accident on the ship. If they were killed out in town or if something else happened out in town, maybe it was some kind of disease. Or maybe, um, you know, it's an accident with a car or something like that. Then whatever training needs to happen should happen for car things. Make sure that everyone's buckled up. Make sure you give training on, uh, reducing your speed. Um, ifit's accident, Let's say a fall. Make sure that, um, the local policies are in place. Um, so, yeah, I just respect the death and respect the people that knew that person"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How should you respond to a suicide on the ship?,"if there's a suicide on the ship, that's one of the worst things that can happen. You know, any death? Um, on the ship is bad, but suicide in particular, is, um, if you just because likely there's something that you could have done toe have stopped it, um, for the suicide. You wanna make sure that training is is is going on concerning how people should respond to that suicide. What things they should do. Um, this could be, for instance, be safe at your job If you find that the suicide is affecting you in particular, Um, you have to go to medical, and you might be in the position that you have toe be placed off the ship, make sure that the person's family is notified and that if they have any questions, uh, they have the correct communication. Um, be through the ombudsman, be it through other people on the ship that knew that knew the family members. Um, yeah, yeah. Suicide is one of those things that you have to make sure that people are well informed and that you're very, very, um, kind to the situation."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What resources are most effective to help sailors deal with grief or loss?,"on most ships, there's at least a chaplain who can help you deal with some some of the emotions that you're going through. Um, if you're dealing with grief for loss, you can talk to them and most of the communication with them. It's gonna be anonymous, so you can feel free to say whatever you want to without thoughts of repercussion later on. You can also go toe most medical facilities, and they should have a T, some type of doctor or nurse who's familiar with with some of the motions that you can go through without going through through a psychologist. Uh, they have training in that, and it can, at least directly to the, uh, somebody at least on base who can help you with that. Um, if something sexual happen to you, then that's a an occasion that you have lots of grief or loss or um, or kind of high, high emotions and, uh, TVs, the victim's advocate or the SAARC's um, they can help you help guide you through some of those emotions and some of the actions that you could take"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How should you handle a sailor who is less effective at their duties due to grief?,"when someone has, uh, something that causes great grief in their life, you must realize that they're not performing at their at the capable at the capability that they should be. So you have to take that into account. And, um, you have ah few tools at your disposal. Uh, number one is kind of ignoring the problem, right? And that's probably one of the worst things that you can do. But, um uh, if you try to distract them from the problem, then it works. For some people, um, it depends on what it is they're grieving over eso. If you keep their mind on their work without delving too much on what it is that they're grieving about, that could help. Um, what's ah, better tactic is to get it out in the open and see if they need to be taking off the ship or assigned to a different job. That, like, let's say, this job is kind of dangerous. If they keep performing it, um, you could send them toe something that's like, let's say, going to the library and helping people there. There they have a little bit more timeto think about, um, the thing that's causing them trouble without putting other people's lives in jeopardy. Um, uh, one of the last result resource is, is toe. Get them off the ship. Um, if for some reason like just being on the ship is something that they can't really um, perform effectively at, then maybe they should get off the ship. Either you give them some vacation time, and you just let them, um, grieve with whatever resource is they need, Uh, maybe with family, maybe with the psychologist, Uh, maybe with their personal chaplain, Um, you can send them there, or you can, um, send them to a specific place. Like, for instance, um, there are several places on the base that they could go to, um, if they need help. Especially like, let's say, there have a drinking problem. Um, there's places for that that they can get that help"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How should you respond to someone who has thoughts of suicide?,"The main training that we get when you have somebody who's thinking about suicide is to not keep it to yourself. Uh, you go to the victim's advocate and you let them handle it. Um, the first thing that you want to do is number one. Um, listen to them. Let them chat with you. The next thing that should be on your mind is to not leave them by themselves, where they're gonna be sent. They should be with someone, be it you or someone that you send with them. Um, and the third thing is, um, after they're in good hands is to follow up with them, Let them know that you know you as a supervisor and you as a ship, you care about them and their well being."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How can I get a plan in place to help ensure a suicidal person has someone to contact?,"If you're going to be in an environment that has, AH, strong military population, then one thing that most do commands give. Everyone is a car that has the victim's advocate hotline, and most people put it in their wallet. In this way you have a direct communication, Thio, um, somebody who's an expert in the field so that if somebody comes to you and they have that for suicidal thought, that you can call the hotline and then you're in constant connection with that expert."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Have you known someone who died in the Navy? (or seriously injured?),"I've known someone who I worked with for several years who was seriously injured. Um, they were going into, ah, 41 60 fold panel. And even though they had some safety application safety precautions on, they didn't understand, What kind of voltage is, uh, they were actually checking, and I'm not very familiar with the situation, but some kind of precautions were relaxed, and they had a really big spark in front of them. There was a big explosion. Um, some people were hurt, but the person that was directly inside, um, my friend, he was hospitalized for close to a year, I think. And then, um, was in a wheelchair for a little bit longer after that."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How you known someone who committed suicide in the Navy?,"I've never known anyone who's committed suicide, but I think I have heard hearsay off people that were on the ship who did commit suicide."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"What risk factors should you look out for, to identify a real suicide risk from person having a bad day or rough patch?","each day can cause lots of emotions, depending on like what you were doing for that day. Let's say someone made you very, very mad and your super angry and you're punching walls, right? Uh, things can just be blurted out. Um, it's not my call Thio determine whether they're just blurting something out or if it's the, uh, combination of a long history off something that's been on this person's mind that I just haven't been aware off. It's not my call. As soon as they say, um, I'm thinking about committing suicide. Uh, all of the my thoughts just go off off off until you get to the switch that says, Hey, you know what? Tell somebody about it. That one goes on and then you direct them straight to the to the expert. I'm not an expert"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What's a good way to ask someone if they are suicidal?,"so before someone tells me that they're suicidal, like if they say I'm suicidal, you direct them to the expert, the victim's advocate or the Stark. But before that time, if I think that they might say that the best thing to do is just to directly ask them. Hey, I've been noticing this. Are you having thoughts of suicide? If the answer is yes, then, um, you stay in contact with them, you direct them to the V A. Uh, otherwise, they might just give you some of the main topics on their mind. And then your goal is just to listen. Listen, listen."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How can you help encourage people with suicidal thoughts to talk about it with others?,"You should never try to push anybody to do something they don't want to do. Um, if someone's talking about suicidal thoughts, but they haven't mentioned that they do want to commit suicide, then of course, you should listen to yourself. If if it got to you in the first place, then obviously they must trust you enough for them to share their thoughts. Um, in some cases, it might be a little bit, um, more than just just talk and you don't feel comfortable with them leaving. They didn't say that they want to commit suicide, but you could tell that, um who knows what could happen tonight? Maybe they might speak with an ex girlfriend. Maybe they might have an argument with your wife. Um, maybe it's getting later. And you think they might go drinking? Uh, and you don't want to risk it. So in that case, um, one suggestion will be toe kind of guide them Thio victims victims advocate. Even though they didn't mention, um, suicide. You might just wanna mention that to them so that they could just at least chat it out. You might want to talk to the chaplain. Um, just say Hey, you know what? Like, uh, come with me up to the religious office and, you know, here's someone to talk to, um, another, another ways toe. Have a friend just go with them. It's like, Hey, Petty Officer Roland, what are you doing now? I think he's about to go. Go ahead, out. Do you think you might wanna hang out with him for a while and kind of see what's going on? Um, here's my phone number. Just make sure that you contact me because e think this might be going on. So a friend, the chaplain, the V A and yourself, you know, those are the resource is that someone having suicidal thoughts might go to"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What should you do if someone might be a suicide risk and you know they have easy access to guns or other weapons?,"leaders have a really fine line to walk. Um, between keeping separate from their sailors and their personal lives and making sure they're safe. Now, if you're in a situation, um, where one of your sailors has access to guns has have has access to violent things, Then you want to make sure that they don't leave your work area. Uh, with those intentions with those thoughts without speaking to an expert first, um, the chaplain is a really great person to talk to. Other supervisors are as well, if you're still scared that they might go home, um, and still might cause themselves violence. Um, in this case, I would just bring it up. I would, I would. I just wouldn't keep it to myself. I bring it up toe the command master chief, or even the commanding officer. If if I felt it was necessary"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,When is a formal report necessary for a possible suicide risk?,"personally, I've never dealt with a formal right up for a suicide attempt. But I would imagine that if anything happens physically thing, we should, uh, write it up. So, for instance, if the person hurts themselves if they heard another person, um, if they're very, very violent, if they say, um yeah, particularly terrible things, For instance, um, you know I want to hurt myself. Uh, then you at least want to document it so that where that you or whether somebody that comes after you, who's who's not familiar with the situation, there's at least a track s so that we can either look at the past history and make a determination on what we should do with the person or someone who's not. You can actually look at the past and have a good idea about what they should do with that person."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What are some good tips for dealing with grief?,"a good way to deal with grief is to really focus on some of the positive things that are happening in your life. If you have family, if you have kids, uh, if you have a good network of friends, then those are the main ones that you can go to to kind of get your mind focused on. You know, some of the positive things instead of the thing that's really cousins use, um, problems. Um, of course, you know, their their individual moments. You know, you're thinking alone at night you're driving home, Um, when there's no one around and you can't really, like, distract reminding that way. Um, in that case, you know, it's Ah, yeah, just stay positive. And during those times as well, maybe, uh, cost someone on the phone. Um, yeah, do some kind of sport that works out really, really well as well"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What options do you have to work with a sailor who is sick frequently or for longer periods?,"when there's someone who's sick chronically and frequently, uh, to tell you the truth, then maybe just handles that we don't treat them differently than any other person. Um, you can have a sprained ankle, and it could last for, like, three or four months. Um, ifit's something that commanding officer can't deal with or the your division officer can't deal with. Then they get sent off the ship. However, if they are on the ship Assuming that, you know, all these cases are on the ship. Then, um, you just let them live in their light, limited duty, um, world. And once they come back, then you treat them as normal. If they're on light, limited duty, you don't mark them down at all. You whatever job they have, whether it's in a limited role, you just grate them accordingly. We don't discriminate here based on disability."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"Are there specific strategies to deal with stress at a time when you can't take a breather? (e.g., active engagement/conflict)","from my active duty days. There are always temple always periods off high tempo that Yeah, you definitely don't get a breather on. Especially when we're fighting the enduring freedom. Um, yeah, there. There could be, I think every four days you were up for 24 hours. Non stop. And, uh, for those for those times, you just have to make sure that the time off you enjoy it to its maximum. You take a nap when you can, you play cards and you get your mind off of work as much as possible. But, uh, we're young and energetic for a reason. And, um, yeah, we, uh the youth of us. We don't need that breath. We are. We take it, and we we perform the mission."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"Are there specific strategies to deal with grief at a time when you can't take a breather? (e.g., active engagement/conflict)","if you're in a really high temple operation and you're dealing with grief and you think that it's, um affecting your work, the main thing to do is tell your supervisor you cannot be working in a dangerous situation and dealing with emotions that you can't control. You're putting yourself at risk. You're putting other people at risk, so at least let it out in the open. Um, your supervisor would likely or I would likely put you in a role that's either, uh, less, strict, less less intensive. Or if we keep you in that intense role, uh, that will monitor you more closely, will make sure that you're not directly affecting somebody and putting their their cells at risk."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,When should you get Navy resources involved with a risk of suicide?,"as a supervisor, it's really important to understand your crew. You have to know about their past. You have to know their behaviors. You know, what type of person are they? Are they sweet and kind? Are they angry? And it's important to notice changes. So if there's a risk of suicide, then, um, I take all of that into consideration and make sure that I get them to the experts. Uh, this could be whether, um, they're more violent than usual, whether they're punching things where they're hurting, whether they're hurting other people. Um, whether something happens in their life. Whether, like, for instance, their wife just, um walked out of the house or the kids are having problems at school or they were having an argument with the next door neighbor. You know, those are things that, if you hear about you, should take those into consideration and be it something really big, like, ah, huge argument with a co worker or little things throughout the last few weeks, a few months that you think might have some some significance. Um, you make the call as a supervisor toe, bring it up to the next level"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What is the ratio of men and women on a ship?,"I think I recall the ratio of men to women on the ship is, uh, seven men toe three women."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Can you date while on a ship?,"there are local rules that inform you, um, how you can date? What's general is that you can't fat in eyes, which means that if you're in a supervisory position, you can't, um, date someone underneath you. So there are exceptions. So, for instance, let's say your first class can you date second classes. Well, it might depend on whether that second classes, um, on a different, um, like like a part of a different um, unit. Then you can tow Electrician's date. Well, if ah, first classes in, uh, reactor room one and the second classes in reactor room to even though they're a part of the same electrical division, maybe they can date. So, um, that that that's a little bit more flexible. Um, what's not flexible is, for instance, if you're a chief, you can't really date people underneath you, so they actually have to get off the off the ship. Um, if you're an officer, you also can't date, um, enlisted people. Um, maybe officers can date each other, but for instance, they have to be separate. Basically, the rule is, um, within the chain of command. Nobody can, uh, anyone up the chain of command or below the chain of command. You have to actually have to be separate or you have to be off the ship."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Describe any instances of sexual impropriety in your workplace and the consequences.,"it really depends on how egregious the the assault is. Um, it's not always assault. Sometimes it's limited touching. Um, and maybe if it's a guy or girl, they say, Hey, please don't touch me that way. And that's the end of it that happened quite frequently. Um, I think I probably saw an occurrence of that. Maybe once per year. Um, it even happened with me. You know, like your in your in your in your rack and then someone graduates like, Hey, wake up. You know, like, hey, you know, like, keep your space that happens. Um, you know enough to be noticed, but not, But but the occurrences aren't, uh, so bad that you have to tell your supervisors on. Then you There are some cases that you hear. Hey, you know what? Like um, there's gonna be There is some kind of, um, process with someone in the unit, Um, that that you hear about it. Maybe it's not in your unit, but somewhere on the ship. And, you know, rumors kind of spread. Um, technically, you're not supposed to know about it, because if there is a sexual assault, um, commanding officers is maybe he could know about it, but he doesn't have any names. But in general, people kind of know, um, who is getting too close to other people? And that's when rumors start. In those cases, the person who's making the the the accusation might be sent off the ship, especially if people know about about them. So they're not ostracized. Um, in other cases, you kind of just here that it did occur or had occurred. But people kind of know the rules in place, that you're not supposed to talk about it. So you might filter down to the to the people like, Hey, you know, this probably happened. But then then it just disappears. Who knows what happens with that case? Um, eventually, the other person might go to jail, and, you know, you might not not see someone, um, based on the results of the finding, but for the most part you don't know who um made accusations or what specifically occurred, but it does happen enough t b to be noticeable"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How much does sexual misconduct affect a team compared to other bad behaviors?,"sexual assault is really different than other bad behaviors in the fact that you can actually, like, lose valuable team members based on it. Um, number one sexual assault generally doesn't have, um, specifically to do with work. Of course, they can occur, um, during the work environment, and that creates bad moral, um, bad morale within the unit. However, um, whether I can, you know, check a pump, you know, for for the correct voltage or not, has nothing to do with, um, me trying to get a date with you later on. So So there's a very, very strong line between work and, um dating, but they mix when you involve sexual assault and sexual harassment. Um, specifically, I remember we had a master chief, and he was one of the good master chiefs that I've had. Um, he was very direct. He's very stern. He got everybody to do the work the right way and efficiently. Um, however, he had, um, some communication with, uh, someone someone in our unit. Eventually. Hey. Got kicked out of the off the ship, and, um, he eventually became a senior chief, and we saw him walking around his career. You know, like it's probably gonna end pretty soon after that ast faras the grill like she stayed on, but she had a badge, and yeah, everyone knew what happened between them. Um, she got to stay on because, like, she's lower. Um, she had a lower responsibility in that, um the higher you go, the more supervisor you are, the more you're gonna be hammered down on, you know, And a zoo was hit, as was her case. I'm not sure that she had a, um her rank removed, but yeah, yeah, that that's, ah, fragmentation in in that case, And it really affects the unit to have someone who's really good at their job being removed and having someone who stays in the unit have that cast that shadow above her for the rest of time that she's there. So sexual assault, sexual harassment, fraternization, all the sexual things that don't really deal with your job. You kinda want to stay away from, um, leave playtime and playtime and and work at work."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,Is sexual harassment common? What kinds?,"the sexual harassment can, uh, take form in a variety of different ways. We have red blue. I'm sorry. Red, yellow and green lights red is, uh, agree. Just green is, um you know, you can get rid of those with, uh, stern and strict words. Yellow is somewhere in the middle and green, I think, happens fairly often. And the reason for, uh, slight sexual comments throughout the work days Because, especially on deployment, you know, you're with everyone all the time. Um, from sunup to sundown. Um, you have guys and girls and they have their emotions. They have their feelings. And some people, actually, I think the military isn't is a wonderful place toe. Meet a spouse. There are many military couples. And without, like, talking to each other during work house, are you gonna get to know the other person? It's when you ah kind of go too far in trying to show your emotion to the other person. I'm allowed toe talk to anyone on this ship and say, Hey, you know what I think that's Ah, nice outfit that you have. And that's one way that you can start. Ah, communication. Um, once we get out of work, for instance. I see them outside. I could maybe get their number at work, and then we take it further outside of work. Um, if you're on deployment, you don't have that opportunity. Uh, everything that you do, you know, if you're gonna talk to them, it's going to be at work because you're at work for 24 hours per day. Uh, the most important part of the most important thing to remember is that it cannot exist on this ship. There is no dating. There is no getting together. There's no kissing and hugging on this ship at all. Um, so, yeah, you can get to know people. You can sit down, chat, talk, talk about the general quarters that happen, talk about like when we get off the ship, you know, like like let's continue this further. But on the ship, you know, just make sure that it's purely platonic and and that that will save you a lot of heartache in the future."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,When should you step in if you feel like somebody might be getting harassed? What's a good way to do it?,"if you feel that someone is being harassed, obviously has passed the friendly point. Um, and you think that's going a little bit too far? You have several different, um, methods that you can you can resolve to to get it, um, get you taken care of. One way is direct. You know, you just go over to the person you say, Hey, um, I know. So what's going on? Maybe you should chill out, whoever it is, And, uh, and that that might work another way. It could be indirect, Which means that you might not know the two people, you know, they could be strangers, but you might notice that their friend had been hanging out with them. You can kind of talk with him and say, Hey, you know what? Like I noticed this going on because you kind of go over there and make sure everything's mellow. Another alternative is, uh, you can use the protocol, which is you go to their, uh whatever. Supervisory, um, person is there, So if it's on the ship, it could be an MP military police. If it's out in the club, you could go to the bartender. Maybe there's a manager. Maybe there's a bartender. Maybe there's a local police officer, you know? Um, yeah, You have some authority authoritarian figures that you can go to to kind of like Mel out. The situation on there's also like if none of those work, um, or if you want tohave a little bit more casual, um, way toe talk, these people you can do, um, distraction. That's when, like, you see, you see the two people having some kind of interaction and you say, Hey, you know what? Like let's go play pool or Lett's Let's have this conversation over here. Let's go dancing. Um, you don't mention the topic directly, but you do change the topic based on something that you think might be a little bit more friendly to them."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"FAIL What situations have a higher risk for harassment or sexual assault? (e.g., duty cycles, locations, events)","sexual assault can almost happen anywhere in public places and private places, but they tend to happen more often, Um, and in intimate settings at the job. Then, uh, if you're working with another person, um, and you find them sexually attractive in a isolated location, those tend to be high risk areas. Uh, for me, as a chief, when I'm giving counseling, I always try toe have the door open, because when you have, uh, a person that that that could happen with and you have the door shut, then you know words gonna happen. Um, especially like, if if the two of you don't really, um, connect so much, then you know, like false accusations can fly. So those air scenarios that you tryto have other people around so that they can kind of diffuse the situation or at least like make sure that, um, words aren't sad and touching aren't going on. Um, and it zips in the wide open area outside of work. The obvious places are bars and clubs, you know, even though it's ah very public setting because you don't feel as much, um, stress due to the job, um, like people are actually looking at at you, you know, like thinking about sexual assault. You let down your guard and you get a little bit more touchy, You know, out there in the drunk E you know, like, uh, hanging out areas and stuff. So, yeah, clubs bars isolated areas on the ship."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"What situations have a higher risk for harassment or sexual assault? (e.g., duty cycles, locations, events)","sexual assault can happen anywhere. And as a chief, you have to be aware of some really isolated events, Um, that have a higher risk of having sexual assault. Thes could include working in, um, you know, like in the far reaches of the ship. Maybe they're down in the build together. Maybe two people are up on the vulture's row together. Um, make sure that, um, there other people around so that they will be less apt to kind of get together. You wanna keep people separate? Um, another place, obviously. Wherever there's alcohol involved, you know, bars and clubs. So whenever you pull into port, I make sure toe describe to people Hey, you know what? We're all together on the same team. Make sure that you don't get too touchy feely out there even though, like you've been working with this person for the last, like, a few months together, and you might have stronger feelings. Um, for them, compared to strangers, make sure that they don't get out of hand once whenever you pull into ports. Also, like whenever we're doing counseling. As a supervisor, I make sure that I always have the door open. Um whenever I'm doing like one on one counseling, or that there is a third person in the room thin, the door could be shut. But as long as there, um there is in a situation where it's one person's word versus another person's word, right? You want to try to avoid those situations as much as possible."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What kinds of behaviors do you ban that are sometimes allowed in the Navy?,"as a supervisor, I generally follow whatever the Navy guidelines are. If it's banned by the Navy, then I ban it. If it's not, if it's allowed by the Navy, then I allow it. Um, there are some exceptions. So, for instance, let's say we have a sailor who just got a red badge or yellow badge. You know, they got caught drinking. They got caught staying out after curfew. And the Navy has these rules like, Hey, you know what? Like now, you're not supposed to be out after 11 o'clock. In those cases, I'm a little bit mawr, um, more strict with them. I say, Hey, you know what? Like if you get caught past caught, if you get caught out past 11 o'clock in, the name is going to do this. So I suggest I strong suggest that you make it here by 10 o'clock. Eso That's like a personal thing that I do because I don't want them to ruin their career. You know, like if you're really strict on the line and you know, even even if you're over like past two minutes, you know there's no there's no remorse for those guys, you know, and I know that those rules could be, like, really strict like that. You know, you could be, uh, going to jail for bread and water with bread and water. You know, I I don't wanna see anyone in those situations. So I give them a buffer to help them with their careers. So that, like, if they do go past my band, um, I don't have toe follow the Navy's rules. Whereas if they go back past the Navy's band, then I would definitely go pack, go through with the Navy's rules, you know? So I give him buffers, personal buffers."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"How do I deal with differences in views of appropriate boundaries? (e.g., generational, cultural)","being in the Navy as long as I have been in for going on 20 years. Uh, you have to realize that the Navy changes all the time. There is No, um, there's always a right and wrong, especially like, based on guidelines. But that right and wrong changes with time. Um, for instance, you know, really, a long time ago there was a separate. They were separate, paid between blacks and whites. And now there's not so laws can change and temperaments can change and emotions can change, and the navy changes accordingly. Um, I know that when I when I first joined, um, there weren't that many transsexuals in the Navy and the people that are that were in the Navy had a strong had strong opinions about that. Those same people. I'm still one of them, right? They have to realize that we made rules for them, And some people just don't wanna change their minds so so drastically. They still have their their opinions about the way that it used to be. So, um, your whole goal as a supervisor is to get those people informed about the new rules about like how they have to change about how their career might be in jeopardy if they don't make that change. Um, another another one is PTSD, you know, like we had our opinions about that. Maybe we thought that those people, um, were violent and aggressive, and they don't deserve to have the same, um, resource is that other people had. Now we realize that it deals with mental health, and we should think of it as think, Think of their situation, mawr in a kind of light. Let's say so. We have to make sure that, um for the people with the old way of thinking, they have to get on board with the new way of thinking. And as a supervisor, your your whole role is to understand what the policies are. Um, understand. When you have someone who still thinks the old way and just train them to make sure that they're there, they're more informed"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"How do you motivate sailors to act appropriately, if they think their behavior is harmless?","when you're involved with someone who thinks that they're doing something. Um, that's perfectly fine. And you want them to change, Um, there step that you could take the first one. Especially as a supervisor. You go up to them, explain exactly what they're doing. That's wrong. Um, you know, tap on the shoulder, hopefully in a friendly way. Um, t try to change your mind if you see it re occur. That's when you have the direct counseling. Um, maybe it's another verbal counseling, but you make sure that, you know, they're saying they're seeing their seated in a chair and the third person is there, and, um, they know exactly what you said. Um, they know what they need to change. Another type of counseling is a written counseling. You know, you put in the record, you say, Hey, you know what? Like now something's gonna happen if you do this, then I have it written down that these things are gonna change. Um, so yeah, just as the supervisor, make sure that the steps are included on that, they know exactly what they need to change"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,When shouldn't you deal with a misconduct issue at the lowest level?,"with some situations. You want to just talk to them and try to de escalate the situation on hand. But some situations require immediately immediate escalation. Uh, anything that's violent and anything that's, um, that sexual beyond the point of just words, um, and even depends on how bad the words are. Um, also racial things. Those are the three things on sexual, racial and violent, violent things that I think should immediately be brought up to my supervisor."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"When you are in charge, what are the boundaries that you set for sailors? (e.g., touching, sharing rooms off base)","as a leader, I make sure that everything that I mentioned to them, that there do's and dont's on base off base on this ship or not, Um, they match with whatever the Navy policies are. If you're un deployment, um, obviously is going to change. Uh, especially when you're talking about, like, who can get a hotel with whom and what policies They're gonna be in place like when you're in isolated areas on the ship when you're back at home. Uh, the main thing that you have to worry about is fraternization within, within the units and between the people on the ship when you're outside of base. Then, um, like I tend to let them live their civilian lives. Just make sure that you uphold the Navy's core values. Honor, courage and commitment. Don't touch anyone that you're not supposed to. Uh, maybe keep your words, um, respectable, especially when you're going up the chain. You know when you're talking to officers out out in the in the streets. But in general, whatever the Navy says, that's what I Bye bye"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,When is a formal report necessary for a harassment or sexual assault claim?,"in the Navy, we tend to have three distinct groupings of sexual assault. Sexual harassment, Um, for the green light that tend, those tend to be like a words that you can say to another person. Um, hey, sexy. Hey, sweetie. Things that are a little bit above friendliness, um, that the other person might feel uncomfortable with, or maybe even another person a third person might feel uncomfortable with those could be green light. That's when a supervisor goes to the, um to the parties and kind of squashes it either the offending party and say, Hey, you know what? You shouldn't say those words. Or you could go to the person who was spoken to and say, Hey, um, this'd what I noticed. Um, are are you comfortable with that? And kind of, uh, like, ease the situation there just through words. Yellow light can be a little bit more, um, more intense. That could be slight touching, maybe grabbing the shoulders and and rubbing or, um, patting people on the but especially between, like after sporting events, you know those type of Pat's, um, when there is touching involved, you have to make sure that like the person who was touched doesn't feel that that action was sexual. However, it can be classified sexual, um, based on another person's viewpoint or even if you noticed it yourself. You know, like if you were offended by it, or you have some questions concerning it thin that could be yellow, regardless of whether either of the two parties thought it was sexual or not. Um, but yeah, touching and especially words like, you know, like more serious words Like, uh, I want to do this to the to you Or I think, uh, you know, we should go to this place, you know, like it's a It could be pretty pretty bad. That's in that sense. Red light is definite touching. Um, maybe on private sections, um, lower lower extremities, uh, maybe grabbing long grabs, maybe constant stairs, a certain a certain place, which obviously has sexual overtones on those for those cases. You definitely have to bring those up to a supervisor and get it documented."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What is the difference between a restricted vs. unrestricted report of assault?,"a restricted report is a situation where someone was violated, but they don't want the whole entire command to know about it. Which means that only a few people know are aware of it. Um, the V a, the Sark, the person, um, even even medical people if if they're in in that in that line and the commanding officer finds out that, um, something happened, but no names are given and the specifics aren't given and unrestricted and unrestricted report on the other hand, uh, it zone by a lot more people, you know, probably the police can be involved, and the commanding officer actually knows the exact situation. So more people are involved and you can actually follow criminal report based on an unrestricted report as opposed to the restrict the restricted report."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"In terms of inappropriate sexual behavior, when should you handle it yourself versus get a specialist?","if I personally see something, um, that's sexually inappropriate. Then, depending on the severity, I might go up to the to the offender and separately the Fendi and ask what happened. You know, try to get some kind of, um, some kind of basis for bringing it up to the highest level toe a higher level, something. They're pretty obvious, you know, if something, you know, egregious happens, I might just go straight to my to my supervisor and explain what happened. For the most part, if someone has, um, something bad happened to them, Uh, they're generally not supposed to come to me. We give a lot of training explaining who you're supposed to go to. We have posters everywhere. We have websites that you could go to. We have, you know, training very, very often. Uh, that describes that, um, someone who thinks something bad happened to them. Go to the va, the victim's advocate or the SAARC, and they can give them expert opinion about what they should do."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What is the first thing to do if someone tells you about a sexual assault?,"one of the very first things I try to do is, um, get enough information so that I don't change the the basis of the report. Um, I would like to know if they would like to report it. That's one of the main ones I would like to know if they need medical help or assistance. That's another one. Um, I'd like to know if they if they are just doing fine in general. You know, I don't want, uh, like, send them off in the world, um, crying or, you know, possibly even suicidal without getting some kind of like a connection. Because if they came to me, then obviously they want to talk to me. Maybe they think, um, my words can kind of see them Or that I can direct them to the right location. And I'll I don't wanna send them off without understanding enough about the situation so that I'm doing it correctly. So the things I do get to know them, see if they wanna follow criminal report and see if they need medical assistance"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"What should you do if someone has been assaulted or harassed, but leadership isn't following up?","if I find that someone's being sexually assaulted or harassed, Um, if I'm in their chain of command, if I'm the next person up, then one of the things I would probably do is go find the victim's advocate or the SAARC and try to make some kind of connection between the two people. I'm not really supposed to be involved in those types of things. I definitely don't want Thio have some kind of say in the promotion, um, the wards, the career progression of either of the two. So that's something that you wanna actually separate yourself from as much as possible for lower level things. You know, like quick things. Yeah, you can handle it on the lowest level possible. But if it's enough for me to think you know what this needs expert, it needs an expert opinion. I'll be the first person to go to the VA or the Stark"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"What resources really help to prevent harassment or assault, in your experience?","I tend to find the annual training that we get on sexual assault prevention and response. Um, to be particularly valuable there a lot of definitions that aren't really common because we don't talk about them. Um, so much that the training provides useful information on what is the V A What is the SAARC? What medical facilities do you have available to you? Um, should police be involved. Who is that? Who is in your chain of command, who you can talk to about? About that? All of these things, um, they're experts on there are people who are experts on it, and they could give much better information on it. And we should just have general knowledge on on how we can direct those people to go to it. So annual trainings are really good."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"What are some ways you can encourage a team support a possible victim of assault, rather than become defensive or hostile in the team?","sexual assault is one of those weird situations that you have to be very, very delicate with. If there's some contention, um, outside of sexual assault, let's say then, um, there could be situations that you don't want to, as especially as a chief. But you start sending people tow opposite, um, workstations. So whereas before you can send anybody with anyone, um, you to just choose two names, you go up there. Um, fix this machine or YouTube. Go, go, go check the voltage. Uh, you you have to know who your people are and how they interact with each other, and you don't wanna push some buttons. Maybe it might take a few weeks to kind of like, um uh, decrease the intensity in the in the unit. So in that case, you know, for temporarily you separate people, um, that might work with with sexual assault. Um, however, when you're dealing with sexual assault, things can happen anywhere you know, especially with with a small unit. So in that case, you might want toe have other people aware of the tension between two people, so that, like whenever there's a new opportunity for the two of them, to be alone that as a as a group, as a team, you kind of like, make sure everybody is on the up and up. Um, for instance, like people could be sitting with each other at, um when they're eating lunch together. And that's ah, really prime opportunity for, um, words to be said, um, threats to be made right If people kind of know the other people in the unit. Um, so even as a supervisor, if you're not there, they can still kind of quell the situation. Um, it might get to a point, uh, that you have to send the person to another unit if if they can't interact with each other. Well, um, if it escalates too much, then you might want toe talk to the VA or the Stark, and they can kind of see where they were to go from there. The experts"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,"What are the roles of different resources to respond to sexual assault? (e.g., chaplain, sapro)","when a sexual assault occurs, there are many. Resource is that you have, um, that you can take advantage of, uh, one would be the chaplain. Um, it could be your spiritual advisor. They could give you some kind words and make you think about life positively, um, regarding your case, Uh, regarding a case. There's the victim's advocate who's more in an administrative role. They can tell you what resources are available. Um, what things can be charged on, What type of charge There there it will be, whether it's gonna be, um, restricted or unrestricted. And the SAARC also plays a role in that as well. They have, um, lots of knowledge available to them that they can share with you. Um, if they're one of the first people that you go to if you've been, um, uh, if you have a sexual assault case that you want to talk about, um, a swell as the medical field, you could go toe doctors and nurses and your local hospital, and they can explain what things that they will provide if you've been attacked or assaulted"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What are signs you should look out for that might mean there is discrimination after a disagreement/harassment?,"as a chief. If you've been, uh, in the unit a lot, you kind of know if the mood changes after there's been some kind of discrimination or assault or things that could really affect the unit, Um, you might notice a difference in the mood or the tone of the unit. And that might let you know that Hey, you know what? 20 minutes ago, there was probably a big argument. I found that a lot on my last ship. Um, sometimes I would go inside and everyone's eating pizza and kind of chatting and joking around. Another time I would go in and everyone's rocking in their chairs. Or it's just sitting down like staring at the walls and stuff. You know, something kind of happened eso If the mood changes, that's one. If you see a decrease in the quality of work, that's another one. Um, especially if a really good person who never has any problems starts handing and shoddy work. Then that's cause for you to say to sit them down and say, Hey, um, did something happen recently"
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,What do you do to avoid bias when evaluating sailors?,"the way that I tend to avoid bias is number one by giving constant feedback. Um, a case in in point is, um, I'm supposed to give evaluations for, um, several people in the unit. Let's say they're 20 people. Um, at the beginning of the cycle, um, I tell them exactly what I expect for them. Toe earn the wars that they're gonna get. Earn the marks that they're gonna get. Um, I make sure during the midterm counseling, I sit them down. I give them a sheet of paper that describes how generally, um, grade them. Um, maybe not always with the direct marks, but I tell them where their strengths are, where their weaknesses are and what I expect them to do. Um, in the next six months, to kind of increase their scores. Um, and especially during counseling, I, um, make sure that I put everyone's, um I put everybody on on an Excel sheet, and I have, like, all of the roles, like professional development leadership, um, can, uh, climate inequality. I put all of those down, and then I mark exactly based on what they wrote on the back of their evaluation, how they increased each of those scores and I go through everyone. I make sure that, like if I gave somebody a good score, that someone who did the same exact thing gets that same score, a zealous for the negatives. And then, um, I think that that's how I prevent bias in my own grading That goes the same for awards if I'm handing out awards or if I'm giving promotions."
,,leadership_anderson-clint_cpo,How to help ensure everyone has a voice rather than a majority clique dominating/shutting out other perspectives?,"just like with any other job, you're gonna find that some people are a lot more vocal than than others. You got to make sure that the quiet people, they still get the credit that they that they deserve. Um, just because you're quiet doesn't mean that you can't become a good leader. Leaders do need to be vocal, especially if you're talking toe many, many people. But for the rule, like, let's say your, um, grading people from being for being a second class and below, or even a third class and below. Um, you're not graded on those types of leadership responsibilities talking to 5, 10 people. So the quiet people need to have just as much of a voice and, um, need to be graded just as well as someone who is very, very vocal if they're doing the same quality work. Eso chat with the people who aren't very spoken. Um, actually, you want to praise and criticized the work, um, at the right locations as well. Um, for instance, there's a quiet person you might wanna mention everyone. Hey, I really respect um, Semen Johnson over here for doing this job. Maybe they might not say anything during that time, But everyone else knows, Like, Hey, you know what? Like that's how I can, um, make my work better. Um, And then privately, obviously, if they do something wrong, um, no matter what their behavior is, you wanna talk to them one on one personal person to make sure that they understand their faults and the flaws."
