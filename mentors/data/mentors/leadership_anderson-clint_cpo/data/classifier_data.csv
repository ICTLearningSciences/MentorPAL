But you also have to pair it with listening. You have to listen to your people. So I I know that there are many leaders, um that have people come in. And then the leader just yelled at them and screams of them and says, You should do this and you should do that and then seems the way. So, um, there's a time for that. But for the most part, everyone has some kind of story. Nobody's out there trying to be evil. No one is out there trying to do the wrong thing for for the most part. So listen to their story, Um, and also be empathetic. So even if they were wrong, you should know, especially if they're young sailors. They didn't grow up the same way that you did. Um, yes, of course they can be treat out, but it's more important for them to understand why you're telling them to to do things a certain way and to get them on board What you don't want to do is instruct them. They know the right way, but then they leave, not wanting to do the right way. You have to make sure that your words come out so that hey, you know what? We're a team. You did it wrong. You understand that? You did it wrong. You're gonna be a leader for other people. So you have to do it this right way and you have to go. You have tow, have them leave saying you know what?

s001p003s00020543e00025747,First Steps,"I'll go with the second most important step, which is to know the material, to understand what it is you're talking about. And you might ask Well, how can that be? Number two on the list? Uh, the first thing that you, uh, that supersedes that is to know who to ask and where to get your material from. You don't have to memorize things. Uh, there's so many instructions, so many things that change on a day to day basis, it would be impossible. You make yourself go crazy, but you have tow have your google at your side. Um, it's not Google, but you have to know where to get things from. So down in, um, I t you have to know the person to talk to going to this website, you know, that's where the instruction is. As long as you have those materials.

s001p003s00035548e00044738,First Steps,"there are many tones that you can have when your leader, um, they range from being very, very direct. Especially if you're out there, you know, huge strong person, um, able to lead, lead the pack. Um, if that's not the style of the style that you were brought up in as when you were growing up, that you might want to take more of, ah, friendlier turn a friendlier, friendlier tone. So, for instance, um, people can come to you and you work through problems together. Um, it depends on the type of person that you are. But in any case, everyone has understand that you're on the same team. So with that in mind, when they come to you, whether they know that you're gonna be stern and strict and maybe have a few, um, strong words in there or if you're nice and sweet and kind, uh, they have to know that you know what? Like they're gonna give you a high five at the end of the day and say Yes, sir. Yes, ma'am, I'll go do it",How do you set the tone as a leader? What is the right tone?
s001p003s00051341e00064108,First Steps,"the most common mistake that I see new leaders make deals with them, providing information that they're not sure of themselves. As a chief, you always have toe think Well, you know what? I have the answers. I know the answers. And that's not 100% accurate. Yes, I am the person with the answers. But the more important question is where I get those answers from the reason that I have all the answers is because I have ah crew of people behind me that can back me up that have the answers throughout all of the people. And, um what first classes? The problem that I've seen in upcoming 1st and 2nd class is is thinking that they are the ones that that the information comes from themselves. And in that case you probably get some wrong answers. Um, depending on what they're saying. So, for instance, um, you're talking about an award. Oh, well, this award needs needs this and that. And you don't you don't need it. You don't need that block filled out. Well, some of those things could be wrong, but because they're under such stress toe actually provide an answer. They provide some answer the difference between new answers and, for instance, Chiefs. The chief will say, You're supposed to felt this block this block. It's supposed to be filled out like this. This block. Hold on, I'll get back to you And that's the difference between a strong and a week later.","What are the most common mistakes you've seen new leaders make? (e.g., skipping steps)"
s001p003s00070570e00082467,First Steps,"whenever you work with a team. First of all, you have to know your team. And once you know how they interact with each other, uh, you're bound to find some kind of dissension among these peoples. Um, they have lots of time together outside of work. Um, they might see each other at bars. Some of them might be dating other people that might have family problems. And those small problems can actually filter in into the unit now. Generally, there's not so much of a problem with that. That's how come you have, like people high fiving and people joking around and people like, uh, tapping each other. You want that kind of familial bond? But, um, if there is a problem, for instance, like, let's say, two people are dating and then they break up, then they're not gonna wanna work with each other or they're gonna work with each other bad. And for the most part, uh, it tends to go away. But if you don't take care of it, it can grow to be really, really, really big problem. Um, people's lives on the line. And if you have somebody that doesn't want to go down and check on someone when they're supposed to, or if you have someone that says like, hey, argument with this personal yesterday and I'm going to give him a bad recommendation, things like that that could get really, uh, out of hand pretty fast.","What problems need to be rooted out early, or you'll have trouble fixing them later?"
s001p003s00085093e00101280,First Steps,"there's this quote by Sun suu. I don't recall exactly the words, but the meaning of it really got to me. Uh, it went along. Lines of this, uh, the leaders that are most beloved are the ones that just, like, tell anybody everything, uh, next is most feared, uh, next to the ones who like, um, are really prized among everyone, but the ones who they're most effective are the invisible ones. It basically went like that. So I think that the mawr invisible you are as a leader. Um, even though you are controlling things from behind the scenes, uh, more credit that you give him, the better he'll respect you and you'll see it, um, devolved into the group. Ah, lot more if they take more responsibility of their actions. Um, even though they have a lot to learn and you are teaching them a lot, um, you don't want that to filter down to the crew. So, for instance, um, my first class would come into my office say, Hey, this needs to be on. I give him the exact instructions so that he can't fail. Then he goes out, and he described it to the crew. Now, little do the crew new do the little Does the crew know that I'm the one who actually explained things to him. But he was my, um my go to go through guy. And he's, um that's the way that you are supposed to handle leadership by passing it down through the ranks.",How do I balance being close with my team versus fraternizing?
s001p003s00111266e00124916,First Steps,"there is a strong line that you need to draw between, um, your friends and your co workers and especially your co workers and your subordinates. Um, it can't be crossed over. They generally say that once you become a chief, all of the friends that you had, you know, if they were in your corner and if they were going to bat for you, then they'll understand the distinction that has to be drawn once you become a chief and they're not gonna treat you the same way that they did before. So you used to go toe clubbing or bars or joking around about the latest people on board this ship. All of that stops completely. So in that case, once you turn that switch off, how do you turn it back on? All the people have toe develop a new type of respect for you. Uh, it generally comes from the fact that you're very knowledgeable about your your subject. That's why you're promoted in the first place. And the second part has to do with the fact that you're caring for them. You know you're caring for them as a team member and that you're looking out for their safety. With those two pieces in mind, um, the balance will actually, um, come as a side point. Um, whenever they become the the same leadership position is useful. For instance, off. You know, third class petty officers become first class petty officers, first class, first class. Petty Officer has become chiefs and chiefs. Maybe they become officers. Once those huge balance or jumped, then you're able toe like I have the same communion, but, um, you definitely need to make that distinction.",How much leadership should you take charge of versus letting your senior petty officer lead?
s001p003s00130634e00141169,First Steps,"The main thing that you have to learn as a new leader is the type of responsibility that you have versus what you used to have. So, for instance, um, working with your hands cleaning the Cellini to sell your expected to go out there and then twist it off and drink it off and put the new one in. And, um, as a leader, you have to get that same job done without actually doing it. It's kind of weird, I know, but your role is to tell someone else to do it. And I've seen a lot of leaders have that problem, especially people that that have the new position. So a second class becomes the first class. I'd actually have to go down there and tell them. Hey, you know what? Get off that pipe. Get off. That's Lenny to sell. Um, you have three other people here. They're not gonna learn by you actually doing it. We know that you can do it. You've done it thousands of times. Now it's your time to put the wrench in that person's hand and watch him do it. Um and then, yeah, after, after about a year or two, they finally get on board with that. And that's how you become the next rank. After",What are the main things that a new leader must learn and adjust to?
s001p003s00143124e00154668,"Background,First Steps,Priorities","my priorities changed a lot. Um, since I first joined the Navy when I first got in, I was always thinking about Well, how much am I going to get for school? Okay, put that inside. How much of my saving up for my time after the Navy. Um, if I were to join the Navy Reserve, put that off to the side. What kind of certifications can I can I get? What kind of training can I get that goes on my record that I can have for later on later on, You kind of realize you don't realize it's actually like training on you. And, um generally, most chiefs feel this way. All the things and all the activities that I've done are kind of they're not meaningless, but their second fiddle thio the type of work or the type of things that I could give to my sailors. So for me, my e is whenever somebody gets promoted, um, second to that is whenever anyone gets an award and although that's not necessarily on my record, I do get, you know, some kind of credit for that. Um, I just feel like it's more important kind of like handing down the torch to someone else, and I think that's that's one of the best things that you can have as you grew up in leadership.","How have your priorities changed as your career progresses?

They're not really working there full day, you know? You tell them. Hey, you know, I'll go out and, like, fix all this equipment and then, you know, half the day is over, and then they come back with only one thing changed or two things changed when it should have been the whole things. How do you change that? Well, number one, you have to be very, very clear. Um, these are the leaders, and those three leaders are affecting thes five people. The place that I've been where that hasn't been, the case was very disorganized, and no one knew exactly what they were supposed to be doing. Another thing about being very clear. Hey, these are the rules that expect you to do You have a white board, you label number 123 claiming cellini cells change the pump, fixed the valve, and then you check on those things. Hey, was this done? It is done. Green check. Mark, Wait for the next thing um, yeah. So being being clear and organized are the things that I e I think make the biggest change.

s001p003s00172969e00180945,JobSpecific,"for me. It was really confusing when I joined. I didn't know anything about engineering or electron ICS. When I first came in, it took me the longest time to figure out what a ground was. Everyone kept saying it was the Earth that it was like dirt. You know, I didn't understand how it like, uh, match with electrical work. Um, a couple years in after hearing the same things over and over and over, you start to get good at it a couple years after that. Then you start to become a master at it. Um, a few years after that, then you're in the position that you can actually teach.

You know it's gonna be coming at you all the time every single day, several times a day. The way that I prepared for myself, um, for coming into the nuclear power school actually started training. Um, I took a conceptual physics course and I took algebra, and that helped me through the school. Later on, um, after going through my initial school thing, I found out that, like, uh, even though there are schools available most of the time, you have to actually train yourself. So learning how to read is another big thing that you have to know. Um, if you haven't been a big reader before, especially in high school or middle school, um, that's gonna change if you're gonna be promoted. Um, of course, there are lots of opportunities and lots of training, but the ones I see succeed the most are the ones who actually can pick up a book on their off time and kind of teach themselves.","What priorities would you recommend for a person entering this field?

s001p003s00212628e00223266,First Steps,"I think the best thing that I learned was how toe look up things. I tried Thio be the best leader that I could all the way up until I was the first class. And that was, you know, going on Google and looking here and, um, asking around and, you know, going to another office and saying, Hey, what's the policy on this, you know, kind of like, uh, wagon, my my telling a circle. But, um, before I joined the chief strings, and especially afterwards, I swapped up my leadership style. They actually taught me how to become a better leader. Um, a little bit during, um, my second class and my third class years, but a lot, especially during my first class years. And after I became in chief, uh, they told me which websites to visit. Uh, they told me, like which people in the separate departments toe go visit. So it's not necessarily a skill, um, of knowing how to do something but more about knowing who to talk to knowing that that was a resource that I had that I wasn't taking advantage of before",What skills do you wish you had mastered before entering your profession?
s001p003s00225784e00241884,First Steps,"the question that I wish I would have asked earlier earlier. Um, that was a really big surprise to me. Is the difference between the different ranks? Um, you have pity officers, then you have chiefs, and then you have officers and, um, they're split by whether you have a bachelor's degree and whether you've been commissioned. And I didn't really understand that critical piece until, like, well, in tow. After the time that I joined the join the service, um, for instance, people were being called Chiefs and Master Chiefs while I was in boot camp. They were saying, Well, you know, like if we don't do these certain things, there's certain things that, um, things first class is gonna make a chief and I didn't really understand, Like how you were supposed to be promoted along the lines of the military. Um, being a kid, I just thought, all right, your private I knew what that was, and I heard that there was an admiral and I knew what that was. And I thought you just joined. And then you just stay in. You get better and better and better at your job, and then you're finally you know an admiral or something. I had no idea about the rank structure. But now I know that separated by, um books and learning and degrees and evaluation marks and awards Eso I wish that would have been, uh, clarified even before I joined the service. Um eh, so that I could have a better idea of the structure of what I'm getting into.",What is one question you wished you asked earlier?
s001p003s00245522e00262648,First Steps,"generally, the Chiefs know a lot more than some of his subordinates. There are times that I'm at a table and we talked for an hour just with the Chang, the chief engineer, the other officers in the units, the junior officers in the unit, about the overall goal of the ship. You know what? We have this ship in, uh, in Guam. We need to get it over to this other island. We have these problems with it. You know, this pump over here effects this pump be over there and without that pump than this other machine is gonna work, and you have to kind of understand all of it. Now, the sailors under you don't necessarily need to know that whole entire thing. It's gonna overwhelm them. Some of them have just been in for a few months. Others a year or two, and they're they're just getting the feel for the Navy. So they they're not gonna understand all of those other pieces of equipment or how they operate, But they don't need to. And that's the point. That's your whole goal as a chief, to separate the critical from the non critical. Um, so yeah, that our long conversation that I had talking about How we as a group as a ship as a department are going to get the ship from a to B. I filter that down to say, Hey, you know what? Third class, Petty officer, second class Petty officer, We have, uh, that's led to sell. That needs to be taken out and provided with this new one. Can you guys do that? Yes.

You have time to eat lunch, But when you know, there's a test on Monday and you don't really know much about the material, you spend that whole entire weekend from sunup to sundown just studying. And I would like to say that that whole entire two year training that I had learning about electron ICS and he transferred fluid flow and nuclear technology in chemistry. Um, doesn't quite compare to the training that I got once I got to the USS John C. Stennis that a lot of, um, even non nukes are gonna experience. And this is what I mean, when you're in school, you're in a nice, safe environment. Um, the sun is shining. You can kind of see out the window, but basically, you're at a desk and you're typing and your writing and your, um, listening on did you don't develop too much sweat.

You shouldn't be having any trouble when you get to a new unit. Um, I've known several people that came from U. S s warrior and they were immediately put on the USS Blue Ridge and they slid right in. You know, after the second day, you couldn't tell them apart from anybody else, somebody that that just came in, he would not be able to say, Hey, you know what? Like this is a new guy. Um, that's the way the Navy is supposed to work when it doesn't. Then that's, uh, that's a time that, you know, you and the chief need to talk about what? What the problems are. Is it a personality problem? Is it the fact that you're dealing with this new equipment, that you don't know? Um, how to operate yet? But it shouldn't be that that case at all ast faras personality.

You know, you can't just say, Oh, we have an officer and you never talk about him. You never talk about his rules, his responsibilities. You know that's not good for the team because they don't develop a reporter with him. So I have to say, as an officer, he has a different rule than you guys. He's not down here working on equipment. He's not down here. Um, you know, cranking valves. I I want to say that because when I was coming up through the ranks, I didn't understand this difference. And I had a little resentment towards some of the officers that I saw was like, Hey, you know, we're down here sweating. We're busting our chops. How come I never see him? Um, now, as a chief, I make sure to explain that role toe the team toe to make sure that everyone understands everyone is working really hard.

s001p011s00372817e00393233,Leadership Strategies,"So I had just given the story about, um, my time on the USS Blue Ridge. I was a new chief there, and the unit was basically run by some of the younger 1st and 2nd class petty officers. We had some kind of conflict because, um, it was very lax in the unit, and I had to bring it up toe up to par. That being said, they they were being really, really overworked. And I think that's part of the reason that they were, um, being lax because there was no really strong figure toe view them. And when you come in, when you supposed to come in at seven o'clock and your going to Iraq around, like 10 or 11 every single day Saturdays and Sundays included, then of course, you know, if if no one's like, you know, happening you of your back, then you're gonna, like be easy. Nobody wants to work 12, 13, 14, 15 hours per day every single day, right. So, um, in order to get the unit toe where it needed to be, that's actually what they should have been doing that, that we had that schedule so we could make it on time. And, yeah, it required 13, 14, 15 hours per day. Um, but that's because they weren't working at 100% efficiency. They weren't even working at 60% efficiency, right? So the response to that was, we'll just keep working on harder, and I didn't want to do that. I actually wanted to make them more efficient, but also give them more time. So my goal was, Hey, you know what? Let's First of all, let's stop working them so hard, give them more reasonable hours. Once they see that we're giving them a little bit of more freedom. Hopefully then they'll up their game to, you know, So it's kind of like the chicken and egg. Uh, we're not gonna give them freedom until they start working harder. And I want to do the opposite. I want to give them freedom so that they could work harder. So that's where my issues and the and the units on the upper leaderships issues kind of conflicted.

I'm still in the Navy, you know, part time. But it's not, you know, active duty. Um, another reason is that people would leave the military is because it's not designed for them.

Um, you still have people who are just, um uh, complainers who are aren't good workers who don't work well with other people in in teams. Eso those kinds of things, they actually come out when you're working for the 2nd and 3rd and 4th year. And to tell you truth, it will probably be the best interest of the Navy that they're not there. That's a safety issue, or that's an efficiency issue. Um, so it's better to get those people out so they don't want to be here and to tell the truth, like the Navy confined other people that can replace them. Eso people that don't wanna be here, people that wanna a different career for wanna go to college. Um, maybe this was just, um, to set themselves up in life.

I I barely knew what current was like. I had to understand everything from the very, very beginning. When I think some of those things I should have gotten through public education through the books, I would have read if I would have been a good student or through the training, I would have gotten, you know, had I been a better student in school. Um, so the good thing about the Navy is they do start you off on on an even playing field like you. We expect that you know nothing. They expected people like me, which was which was excellent. So I'm just saying I didn't become the superstar right out the gate actually had toe put in.

And that's taking ownership of whatever it is that you're doing, especially in new school. You actually have toe go to the library, get the steam propulsion manual and start reading, you know, left and right. You don't know something's And yeah, you have some access to other people who know where the material is, But they actually like force you to do a lot of research on your on your own to do the homework on your own. I don't think Yeah, After you start getting a certain G p a like 3.8 Onda above which I had, they don't even expect you to do homework. They just have the tests and say here, you know, you you study night and day Do do baby sit you, um, in a school toe degree. So, for instance, if you're not doing well, you know, you have, like, less than three point? No. Then you have an extra 20 to 40 hours extra that they expect from you. I'm I'm assuming that other, um, eight schools are similar, but maybe not that intense. You know, maybe the material isn't quite as dense, but, um, they do hold your hand through the education. You only have yourself to blame if you don't go through that. But after the two years of a school, uh, then they let you free. You're free to go and especially nukes. They expect you toe, you know, be smart to accept the training. Some of its really dense and you, you know, way above your grade. Your pay grade. So, um, especially the first year, too. They're talking about the top of the, um, aircraft carried all the way to the bottom, to the left and right. And, you know, the electrons that go into it, the things that they need to purchase and how the Cellini cell works on the inside. And, you know some of those things you you barely glossed over in a school. But now they're giving you an in depth, um, rundown of each thing and it, you know, it just goes over your head. But the fortunate thing is, you don't have to memorize those things. I think a lot of it is just they just want you to have some experience with it. And after two years or three years, then you become a pro. And there's this, like path that you're supposed toe, you know, adhere to the whole entire time for you to become that pro. Um, so when you're going through it at the at the very, very beginning, you're you're not sure about how much you're supposed toe ingest. Technically, you could spend all watch just reading all books, which is what they expect you to do, which is what they tell you to dio, um, you could spend, um, you know, hours after your eight hour workday just still reading and still not read enough. You know, it's an infinite amount of material that should be covered. That's gonna help you get promoted on the test. You know, the higher your score like, let's say, um, you score really well and then you will be promoted based on, like the percentage that you score above other people. So, yeah, the cool thing is, there's a there's a range for everyone. So if you don't score pretty well, then you know you get promoted a little bit slower. And if you do, um, just read nonstop constantly, then their path for you to become an officer toe get promoted early. So, um yeah, As long as you take ownership of yourself, then I think that that's probably one of the most challenging things that you have is a military person in the new field.","What is the most challenging part about your job?

I I was putting forth my full effort every single weekend or maybe every other weekend. You know, depending you'd have some test on Monday. And I remember just not really understanding all the new material that that that week and just being totally confused. But I remember just going in as soon as Friday. The bell hit, you know, just stand at the library. Read, read, read. Going dinner. Come back, read, read until they kick you out, I think midnight or something. Um, Saturday was, you know, you wake up in the morning, maybe you exercise. Maybe you like, uh, eat some breakfast, and then you go in and you're there until midnight. You don't go anywhere else. Um, that Saturday was full of white boards and writing paper until my finger had, like, calluses on it. And then the Sunday would, um, would be more like, you know, review of what I did. I probably teach other people and that actually helped myself. Um, pretty much the whole day. And I wouldn't go home until I was sure that I would get a four point on the next test. Um, I think I got a four point at once, but the point is that I was I was confident in all of my answers. Um, So I did that for two years because to tell you the truth, I wasn't really interested in the in nuclear propulsion actually want to be a cryptologist. But I heard that this program, which I wasn't familiar with it had lots of math and science, and he transferred fluid flow in chemistry. It had all of that. And I thought that that would be a really good way Thio cover those things that I didn't in high school and prepared before the, you know, the intensive Naval Academy. So at at that two year point when I applied, I was, you know, had a really high G p a. I had a pretty good recommendations from all of my officers. Um, it came back, rejected, and I was actually surprised. Um, later on, the x o of the academy called me out of the blue I was studying, you know, kind of like, you know, like, um frustrated. And he called me and he said, Hey, you know, like, um, I just want to let you know, Like we saw your, uh, your application and, you know, we have some chit chat, and he said, Well, you know what? Like I think I'm gonna send you to boost, you know, because like, you're an excellent candidate, by the way, Um and then I told him I'm sorry. I'm, uh, past the age. I was 22 but I would would have been 23 by the time. And that's the cut off. And, you know, that was that was surprising to him. You know, I think it was prepared to like Cindy, and and he said, Well, what's honestly, you know, what was the case? Why did you choose your major? So he basically told me why I was rejected. I actually chose economics instead of engineering. Um, Major And I told him that, you know, I think I give some answer that I wanted to, like, learn languages. And I didn't think that it really mattered what major you did as long as you know, like you're gonna just learn leadership and other, um, military qualities at the academy. And he said, Yeah, actually, were we expect engineers, uh, you know, computer science, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering. You know, those those are the main ones that we wanted. So, yeah, we parted ways and I didn't get accepted. And that that was first time I've ever, ever really tried something other than tracking cross country in high school.

Um, I I know there's a really cheesy thing to say, but, I mean, I have my father, my mother, and they divorced when I was young, so my mother kind of just took care of me. So my impression of what family waas was based on, uh, my mother, my sister who is 10 years older than me and her three kids. And it's a group of people that kind of take care of each other. Uh, maybe some people work and then they put money into the house. Maybe someone has a car, and then they drive people around. Um, maybe people laugh and joke, you know, you go to these places and that's what my impression of marriage waas Um, it's a group of people, um, dealing with family issues.

Um, but yeah, months go by and weeks go by and you don't develop the same type of love that should be in a marriage. Uh, you should wanna call back, for instance, I'm unemployment. Um, I should really wanna call back very often to the home. And I was just so involved with work. Um, really, if I would've looked around to my left and my right, There are many husbands who would stand in line for, like, four hours, five hours just to call back to their to their wife.

I'm working for this, you know, And that's actually the wrong way to think about it. You should think every single dollar that comes to me should be split around, you know?

And that might let you know that Hey, you know what? 20 minutes ago, there was probably a big argument. I found that a lot on my last ship. Um, sometimes I would go inside and everyone's eating pizza and kind of chatting and joking around. Another time I would go in and everyone's rocking in their chairs. Or it's just sitting down like staring at the walls and stuff. You know, something kind of happened eso If the mood changes, that's one.

s001p021s01100440e01113286,Sexual Misconduct,"the way that I tend to avoid bias is number one by giving constant feedback. Um, a case in in point is, um, I'm supposed to give evaluations for, um, several people in the unit. Let's say they're 20 people. Um, at the beginning of the cycle, um, I tell them exactly what I expect for them. Toe earn the wars that they're gonna get. Earn the marks that they're gonna get. Um, I make sure during the midterm counseling, I sit them down. I give them a sheet of paper that describes how generally, um, grade them. Um, maybe not always with the direct marks, but I tell them where their strengths are, where their weaknesses are and what I expect them to do. Um, in the next six months, to kind of increase their scores. Um, and especially during counseling, I, um, make sure that I put everyone's, um I put everybody on on an Excel sheet, and I have, like, all of the roles, like professional development leadership, um, can, uh, climate inequality. I put all of those down, and then I mark exactly based on what they wrote on the back of their evaluation, how they increased each of those scores and I go through everyone. I make sure that, like if I gave somebody a good score, that someone who did the same exact thing gets that same score, a zealous for the negatives.

Leaders do need to be vocal, especially if you're talking toe many, many people. But for the rule, like, let's say your, um, grading people from being for being a second class and below, or even a third class and below. Um, you're not graded on those types of leadership responsibilities talking to 5, 10 people. So the quiet people need to have just as much of a voice and, um, need to be graded just as well as someone who is very, very vocal if they're doing the same quality work. Eso chat with the people who aren't very spoken. Um, actually, you want to praise and criticized the work, um, at the right locations as well. Um, for instance, there's a quiet person you might wanna mention everyone. Hey, I really respect um, Semen Johnson over here for doing this job. Maybe they might not say anything during that time, But everyone else knows, Like, Hey, you know what? Like that's how I can, um, make my work better.
