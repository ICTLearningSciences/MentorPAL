Then I joined the Navy Reserve. I was really fortunate. Um, be picked up. I became a nuclear, A nuclear electrician's mate. Um, I went to school for two years. I was really intense training. And then after that, then I went toe USS John C. Stennis, the aircraft carrier. Um, we were stationed overseas. We went toe a lot of different places. A lot of different tours. Um, after the six years there, eight years total active, active time. Then I got out, and I became a Navy reservist. And I've been in the Navy reserves for about the last 10 years or so. Um, they really help me out with school. They've give me a lot of education benefits. Um, during the 10 years I've gotten my undergraduate degree, U C Berkeley gotten my master's at USC, and currently I'm a master student at the Naval Postgraduate School. And, um, pretty much every year I'm really involved with the Navy as well. We spent about about a month of time, working with them between your annual trainings and, um, amount of work that you do on the weekends for your Navy drill weekends. But overall, I've had a pretty productive 20 years, and I'm looking forward to my next. My next tour, currently the most, um, intense training that I've had in the most leadership role that I've had has been the senior enlisted adviser. Um, that's when I was working in Japan last year. Um, in 2019, I was overseeing about 50 sailors, um, stations throughout the country, and I was kind of explaining what to do, how to do their training, how to do their online, um, online stuff And, um, how toe go on their next and trainings things like that. I was basically a supervisor for them, and that's generally my role. My current role in the Navy right now.",_BIO_LONG_

s001p004s00013698e00041764,"on the USS Stennis. I came in as, Ah, Petty officer, third class. I was, um, during that role. You're basically in charge of just kind of learning for the first couple of months. So going down in the plants kind of give me a feel for the layout of the of each level of where the components are and training Thio for your first watch stations that could take up thio maybe four months or so After you get your first watch, you do that job sporadically, you know, maybe every day. But it could be like maybe five hours of watch standing, uh, in one role. That's log recorder. Um, that was the first job that I had. That's when you look at lots of gauges and you make sure that everything is within specifications. If something's out respect, then you tell the watch officer Hey, you know what? I'm down here at this up for long recorder. You're actually in an enclosed environment with the officer, So you kind of just look over and say, Hey, you know what? I'm reading this high temperature on this pump or high voltage on this turbine generator s so it's kind of simple at at the beginning. Uh, the other times you're actually giving physical hands toe work. So, for instance, let's say you have to clean out, um, a turbine generator or change out a pump or supposed to change out some light bulbs. Um, you do that for about a year, kind of easy work until you become maybe a second class, and that's when you start getting higher quality works. You, um, get higher positioned, um, watch stations. So propulsion Electrician's he his job is toe walk from level to level, looking at different gauges and oil and voltages and current making sure everything's inspect, making sure there's no fires anywhere, making sure there's no smells going wrong. Um, after you do that, then you become a throttle hman. Um, that's another, um, later on, watch where you you have this little will in front of you. And there is a throttle man for every single, um, shaft. So you could be like shaft number one, and then you get ah, command from the navigation that says, Hey, you know what? We need to go all ahead two thirds full flank and you just open it up or set it down, uh, to make sure that, uh, ship starts going faster. Um, later on, Um, actually, for the for the unit. I was I think I deal with training. I was, um, uh, an lpo for supply division for a while. Um, yeah. Yeah. Just basic maintenance mechanic for the whole time.",What did you do on the USS Stennis?
s001p004s00043198e00061795,"When you think of war, you actually think, Well, I actually thought of the soldiers that are on the ground with guns in their hand, looking over Hill, maybe pulling the trigger. Being in the Navy, I kind of saw the wide range of jobs that you that you have very few people actually are shooting and are being shot at, uh, especially for the Navy. Um, they actually say that an aircraft care is one of the safest places to be. So you're out there in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Um, you have subs and destroyers around you protecting you. You have long range radar. Um, also protecting you. So your whole entire job is to get pilots, uh, toe location so that they can drop bombs or they can, you know, um, shoot their weapons and then come back safely. Uh, we're basically the the support for them. So my job was basically to drive them there to make sure that they have services when they're in the ocean. So, for instance, I provide electricity for them. I provide the the speed to get them to the place that they need to go. I provide them with, um, general electrical things. Now you have to understand that when you're in the middle of the ocean, you're not really dealing with, um, war type of things. You know that you're in a war, but you have thio as long as you understand that you're in a in a support type role than days are pretty much the same, you know, like you don't really see other than taking off and coming back. The pilots. You don't really see exactly how you affect the war at all. You just know that you got them there and that you're taking care of them when they're on the ship.",What was it like going off to war?
s001p004s00072034e00092479,"When I first heard about 9 11, I was at prototype. It's the school that trains you to work on a nuclear reactor up in upstate New York. I was walking down my room and my roommate, um, said, Hey, Clinton, take a look at the TV and I looked at the screen. I saw E. Guess there was smoke coming from the first tower. Um, at first I didn't think too much about it, just like everyone else. They said, Oh, it's maybe some smoke or someone said it was a plane. Um, things like that happened, Um, not too common, but it happens enough in American. That's not be surprised. Uh, it was pretty shocking once the second plane hit. Um, after that happened, I after, you know, being glued to the TV for about an hour. You know, they called us all back in, um to school, you know, we got there, you know, we kind of just chatted. No one really knew what was going on. And then after about an hour or two, then they sent us back. I heard that other, um, other military establishments all had to, like, stay where they were. You know, like preparing for war something. But because I was at school, you know that there wasn't really a big need for us to be there. But things changed after that. Before I had things changed my psyche because of that. Up until that time, I thought, Well, the navy is this place where they give you a decent amount of cash. They prepare you for a job, you know, doing some complex with some complex operation. We exercise a little bit, you know, we study a lot, Um, and we get free meals after that. Then I realized you know what? We are Americans. Police. Uh, we are the world's police. We actually have to do something to stop this. We have toe have to make sure that planes don't hit any of my companions again. Any of my my fellow Americans again. So it got riel. Uh, that's a long way of saying that you know what I start toe understand my position in the world after 9 11",How did 9/11 affect you?
s001p004s00101253e00132233,"when I was growing up, I I would say that it should have been involved with lots of bullying, but I had a different take on my actions. I had these glasses and, you know, thick glasses before, Um, you know, when they didn't, when they couldn't fit it out. I had these, like, um, glass holders, you know, that my grandmother gave me and, um, I also spoke proper and being in all black community, I was kind of looked at as, ah, prior it. Uh, I should have been the target of pulling a lot. However, when I experienced that, I would kind of just keep to myself, you know, I said, Well, you know what? Like thes thes people, Of course, there are lots of kids and you always, like, go out there, play tag with them. You play football with them. But I just kind of saw that they weren't, um my crew basically and kind of just stuck with myself. Um, that was when I was a young kid. Maybe before, you know, 89 I then went to Germany, and I started living on a on a military base. And after that, things completely changed. I think I had one or two more bullies after that. But for the most part, because we were all there, we all had a decent salary. We all had toys and games and intend does and bikes. And, you know, life was really good. And I think that that's one of the reasons that bullies exist because they're having some kind of problem with their lives on day kind of wanna, you know, spread the hate around. But when you're having, when you have a decent life when your when your father is in the military or your father is in the Army, your mother is like an admiral or something, and you have a standard paycheck. And, um, you can actually make your parents look bad if you do bad. If someone bullies mean, you know, their parents can actually hear it. So bullying basically stopped once I started going to Germany. Um, I was like that for two years, you know, great life. And then after another year, and then I went to the German section of Germany, and, um, even though I had the glasses, you know, like I was actually looking cooler at the time was actually also working out. Um, then I became a superstar. So for that year and a half, from seventh grade to eighth grade, Um, I was the most popular kid. Girls were liking me, and guys always wanted my friends, you know, invited me to their house. Um, life was really great. So my whole point is to say this once after spending those three years of building my confidence in Germany once I got back to the States. Um, yeah, of course. There were bullies there, but it just flew right off of me. You know, I said, you know what? Like I'm I'm a superstar, you know? You can't touch me. I'm really smart. Um, enough girls told me that I'm really handsome, you know, like So who are you? You know, like, there's nothing that you could possibly say that could actually like, Get me down, you know, and I e think I kept that, um, in high school junior year and senior. I was actually working out a lot. I think I had the body of a football player and I also got contacts. I mean, then I was I was actually really popular kid in high school. So, um yeah, I brushed, pulling off a soon as I went to Germany because I found a place Thio get my confidence from",How did you deal with bullying?
s001p004s00134916e00160645,"I grew up in Flint, Michigan. And as you might have heard from news, it's not the, um, brightest spot to be. I think the people, they're fine. I had family there, more family than I had ever had. Cousins and aunts. I had my mom and my sister and lots of kids. So there is a strong family connection there. Um, that I couldn't deny ast faras being poor. Um, I don't think that inherently, I'm I have the poor psyche, you know, I always do that. I would be successful in life regardless of what was in front of me. That's what everyone always said. You know, like, hey, you know what you're not gonna be, um maybe growing up in this area, you know, like you're not gonna This area is not for you. You, in fact, somebody I remember somebody actually said you're probably gonna be a rocket operator. And when I was working at NASA, I thought, you know, like some guy knew that when I was six years old, you know, it's it's not a coincidence. So, uh, even though I was in the midst of poverty and I can imagine a few a few cases where it could be worse. I mean, I had rats and mice at, uh, cockroaches everywhere. I had prostitutes. Um, yeah, yeah. Drugs was affected me a lot, you know, very close members died, you know, they lost their feet. They were in wheelchairs. Um, in every single case, I decided that that wasn't that wasn't going to be my life. And that wasn't the way I was going to present myself to the world. I think if you if I was to go anywhere, no one would be able to recognize me from growing up in a in an upper scale. You know, California home, because, like, that's not the way I talked that I wasn't involved with hoodlums. Uh, even though I was around drugs, I never tried it myself, and I avoided people who did it. So all of that combined just it was easy to ignore. Uh, that that's a bad word to say. Of course it was apparent, and there's no way that you could ignore it, But it's easy to put in your back pocket and say, You know what? There are other things more important. Um, let's just focus on them. That's what I did",How did you deal with growing up somewhere that was poor and with drugs?
s001p004s00163867e00181466,"I was in Germany for three years. When I was in the fifth grade. I remember being with my father's mother, my grandmother and he was in the Army. I heard that this guy, you know, was in Kaiserslautern, and he was coming to pick us up. Me and my brother and I remember him walking in tow, my classroom in fifth grade and just me being so proud. And maybe everyone had known. I I told him that he was gonna come and he came and picked me up. And I felt, um, exceptional. At that time, I went over to Germany and being with him on the American base was those were some of the best years of my life. I I still think about them constantly, even even today, Um, everyone had, uh, good things and nice food, and we were standing in apartment. But it's a good place for me, you know? Like, I think I had my own room at one time, you know? And that had never happened before. Before that I was always sleep in the same bed is my brother. Um, yeah. Everything was clean and pristine. He had a Corvette outside um, So I did that for two years, from the middle of fifth grade to the middle of seventh grade, and then he got out of the military and he start working for I think IBM or something for Germany were living with his girlfriend. So then we started staying in, um, in in her house with her daughter, and that was a nice little house. And I started going to a German school. We spoke German and on almost no one spoke English.
