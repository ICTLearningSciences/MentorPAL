00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.570
for the people in charge. I want them to know that I'm dependable and

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.280
 that I'm independent. Those two things are, I think, the most important

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.000
 for the leaders above me and for me. When I'm looking at other people,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.720
 I'm dependable, which means that I assigned a task. And even

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.440
 if there are some problems, those will be handled by him or lower. And

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.150
 he's just gonna come back to me with the final result. And the independent

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.870
 part is, um, that once I give him that responsibility, he

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.590
 takes it on, uh, as if it were his own child as and he's the supervisor

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.300
 then and and he just comes back to me with, ah, positive result.
