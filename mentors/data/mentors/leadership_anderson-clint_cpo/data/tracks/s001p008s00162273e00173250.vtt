00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.210
difficult assignments can come in many forms. One could be, um you get

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.570
 stationed to Africa for an entire year. Another could be. You could

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.930
 stationed, um, to a war zone. Um, you can come back with PTSD. Uh,

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.290
 you could come back with a riel angst with from four other people. You

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.650
 know, maybe you had a bad crew that you were working with, Or maybe,

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.010
 um, you were always on edge because of being in that war zone. So

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.370
 all of these things, the navy is really good about informing you what

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.730
 could happen. And they actually talk to your family before you leave

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.100
 to give them kind of a heads up about what you could be experiencing.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.460
 The most important thing is that you have communication with

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.820
 your family while you're gone, or while you're in that difficult, difficult

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.180
 time. If they have some kind of communication with you, they

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.540
 can see how you're changing. And then they can either tell your command

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.900
 or you can give them some kind of. So you could give them some

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.260
 kind of support from wherever you are, so that they could go through

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.620
 it a little bit better
