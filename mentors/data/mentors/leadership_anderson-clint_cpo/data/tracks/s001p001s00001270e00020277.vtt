00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.780
My name is M. C. Clinton Anderson. I've been in the Navy Reserve for about

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.710
 20 years. Um, I grew up in Los Angeles, and a couple years after

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.640
 high school. Then I joined the Navy Reserve. I was really fortunate.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.570
 Um, be picked up. I became a nuclear, A nuclear electrician's mate.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.510
 Um, I went to school for two years. I was really intense training.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.440
 And then after that, then I went toe USS John C. Stennis, the aircraft

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.370
 carrier. Um, we were stationed overseas. We went toe a lot of different

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.300
 places. A lot of different tours. Um, after the six years there,

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.230
 eight years total active, active time. Then I got out, and I became

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.160
 a Navy reservist. And I've been in the Navy reserves for about

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.090
 the last 10 years or so. Um, they really help me out with school. They've

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.020
 give me a lot of education benefits. Um, during the 10 years

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.950
 I've gotten my undergraduate degree, U C Berkeley gotten my master's

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.880
 at USC, and currently I'm a master student at the Naval Postgraduate

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.820
 School. And, um, pretty much every year I'm really involved with the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.750
 Navy as well. We spent about about a month of time, working with

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.680
 them between your annual trainings and, um, amount of work that you

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.610
 do on the weekends for your Navy drill weekends. But overall, I've had

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.540
 a pretty productive 20 years, and I'm looking forward to my next.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.470
 My next tour, currently the most, um, intense training that I've had

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.400
 in the most leadership role that I've had has been the senior enlisted

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.330
 adviser. Um, that's when I was working in Japan last year. Um,

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.260
 in 2019, I was overseeing about 50 sailors, um, stations throughout

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.200
 the country, and I was kind of explaining what to do, how to do their

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.130
 training, how to do their online, um, online stuff And, um, how toe

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.060
 go on their next and trainings things like that. I was basically a

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.990
 supervisor for them, and that's generally my role. My current role

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.920
 in the Navy right now.
