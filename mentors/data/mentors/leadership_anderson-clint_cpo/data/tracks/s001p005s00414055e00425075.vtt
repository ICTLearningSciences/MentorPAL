00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.750
So for supervisors who are unable or unwilling to get feedback, Well,

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.650
 let's do different camps. If a supervisor is unable to give feedback

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.550
 on your leadership, then that just means that you just get someone

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.450
 else. Um, they can't. For some reason, maybe they're too busy. Maybe

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.350
 they're not there at the time. Um, maybe that's not their specialty.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.250
 For whatever reason, Uh, it's very important for you to always get

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.150
 feedback on the quality work that you're doing, so it just doesn't

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.050
 have to be from him. Um, there's someone above him that you can go to.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.950
 There are other people that he worked that he works with, that you

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.850
 can go to them. And there's also your fellow compatriots. Like if

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.750
 someone has done that job before, even though they're not a supervisor,

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.650
 um, they could still give you quality feedback that you can use

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.550
 in your own career if they're unwilling to, uh, that could be a different

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.450
 type of problem. Um, for the Navy, I'm pretty sure that most supervisors

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.350
 that I've encountered are always willing to lend a hand and

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.250
 give you feedback. But if they're unable, if they're unwilling to

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.150
 them, that's, ah deeper problem that you might need toe bring up a

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.050
 little bit higher
