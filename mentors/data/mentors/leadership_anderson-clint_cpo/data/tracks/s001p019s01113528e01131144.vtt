WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.860
as a chief, I find myself getting recognition all the time. Uh, many of

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.860
 the supervisors that I'm involved with they actually, like, you know,

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.870
 explain how how thankful they are to have me, um, in front of the

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.880
 crew. They actually tell me as well. But you will find, though, that

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.880
 as you get promoted, um, you're gonna find your you're opportunities

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.890
 to be recognized like that grow smaller and smaller. Um, you just

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.900
 find that once you make chief and above, that's just not necessary.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.900
 That's not a requirement for your job. If you're gonna be promoted,

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.910
 it's going to be based on the work that you do. And it's basically

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.920
 maybe 80 90% of it. They just say, Who did you train? What did they

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.920
 do? And if they want an award, then you get promoted. So it's kind

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.930
 of an indirect, um, achievement When you when you when your unit is

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.940
 successful, when your first class, which is E six and below. Uh, then

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.940
 it is a little bit more individual. That's when they want you to ruin

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.950
 awards. That's when they want you to run, sailor. The quarter There's

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.960
 no sailor. The quarter for chief and above. I don't even think

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.960
 there's, um, something of the quarter for officers. It's just from

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.970
 first class and below. Uh, there's junior sailor quarter. There's blue

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.980
 jacket of the quarter. Uh, there's Navy calms and dams. I think I

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.980
 want to now that my last award at my last command. But I don't remember

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.990
 what it was for and, you know, thank you very much. I remember

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.000
 just doing the job A Z best as I could. But that's a side note, by the

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 way. It's not something that I was working towards. I think most

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.010
 most leadership will tell you that.
