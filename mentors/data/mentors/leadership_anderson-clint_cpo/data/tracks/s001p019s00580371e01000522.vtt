00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.650
I'll be honest right now. I don't exactly know. Um, the final destination,

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.440
 my life is headed, but I do have some paths. Maybe it's gonna be

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.240
 making my own business. Um, the business could be creating something.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.040
 I'm a computer scientist, so maybe I could create an application.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.840
 Um, maybe I could develop some type of school. Um, for instance, I'm

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.630
 studying cybersecurity right now. Maybe I could develop my own subjects

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.430
 security, business and just grow it. Who knows? I'm also trying

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.230
 to get into the federal government. So maybe I could scrap those

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.020
 personal business plans and just be the best federal person, federal

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.820
 government person. That could be. Now there's some places I could go.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.620
 Let's say there's NASA. I could be, um, someone in charge of putting

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.420
 spaceships on Mars. And that would be a non honorable goal. Toby,

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.210
 apart off. Um, I could work for the Institute of Creative Technologies,

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.010
 which is the company the company that I'm working at right now

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.810
 that they make virtual virtual environments for education and training.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.600
 That's something that I've always been interested in. Um, out of

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.400
 all of these goals, I think the most important thing is to focus on

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.200
 what's present. Um, what I'm presently doing. And that's just trying

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.000
 to be the best student that I could be at the Naval Postgraduate

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.790
 School, um, my subject to cyber security. So I have my goals in front

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.590
 of me. I take four classes, make sure that I do things now that I

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.390
 haven't done in the past, which means read the book from front to cover,

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.190
 whether it's requested or not, which means asking questions to

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.980
 the instructor's, which means which I hadn't done before. Which means

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.780
 conversing with my other peers, which, instead of like being so individual,

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.580
 I need to really, you know, get out there and see See how

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.370
 people solve these problems that are really difficult. So as long as

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.170
 like, for the next two years, um, I'm doing those jobs, though that

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.970
 work that it takes to be a really good student in one of those jobs.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.770
 It doesn't matter which one a za long as it's challenging to me, um

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.560
 is gonna come into play, and hopefully I'll be successful with it

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.360
 at that time
