00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.900
the task that I learned? Uh, well, it varies depending on what type of

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.960
 summer I'm having. If it's kind of an enjoyable summer in Japan, then

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.010
 almost zero, I get home and I get changed. Then I go out, drink some

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.060
 sake, eating yakitori, you know, experienced life with friends in

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.120
 a place that I'm then I'm at like like now I'm in Monterey and I don't

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.170
 really have that many friends, so that gives me a lot of opportunity

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.220
 for free time. I spend my time watching YouTube videos about getting

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.280
 certificates for my degree. I find myself like reading textbooks,

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.330
 so I'd say maybe a third of my time is spent doing extra material,

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.380
 not just wasting time, not just hanging out. Eso it depends on on

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.440
 where you are and and what you're doing. Otherwise, I wish I would

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.490
 have spent a lot more time developing my career when I was in Japan.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.540
 In Japan, I just had my normal job, and then the time hits And then

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.600
 I come home and I kind of waste time. So I wish I would have spent

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.650
 that time. Um, maybe a third of my free time, uh, progressing my career,

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.700
 but it depends on how you feel and just make sure that you do

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.760
 have some years where you really involved in progress in your career.
