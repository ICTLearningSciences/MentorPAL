00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.960
the way I socialized various, depending on where I'm at. When I was in

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.070
 the, um, active duty, I only had a couple of friends. We would actually

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.180
 used to live with one and basically just work. Um, maybe we're

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.280
 separate, or maybe we're together, but, you know, it varied, but we

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.390
 both go home together, And we, um you know, you only have a drink. You

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.500
 know, Netflix goto bars and pools and things like that, but at other

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.610
 places, um, for instance, like when I'm in the Navy Reserve, Um,

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.720
 you generally, once work is over, you just go home to your to your

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.830
 family. Um, you just see each other for those couple of days out of

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.940
 the month. Um, sometimes when I'm on A T and your training for the Navy

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.040
 Reserve Um, let's see, I packed my bags up, put on my uniform, and

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.150
 I work for the Navy at a shipyard for two whole weeks. Uh, that's

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.260
 when you develop a lot of report as a reservists. That's when you're

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.370
 all there together to come there as ah, you know, 12 person group

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.480
 may be different. Um, rates. So there's a mechanic over here and electrician's

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.590
 over there. But generally on the weekends we find some something

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.700
 with NWR to go do together we go to soccer festival. If we're

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.800
 in Japan, we go. We gather up all the troops up together on a Saturday.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.910
 We visit Boston if we're in, uh, in New Hampshire, Um, yeah. We

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.020
 generally find things to do outside of work on t help us grow together.
