00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.980
warning signs Warning signs on the team are If you hear loud voices, that's

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.120
 number one for most of the work that we do, You're supposed to

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.250
 go change your pump. There should never be any loud voices unless it's

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.380
 laughter. Right. So when you hear someone saying that was my wrench

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.510
 or you're not supposed to go there or you're gonna get shocked,

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.650
 there's something like that. There's some kind of argument, you know,

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.780
 um, if you just hear that from the corner of Ah, here, You know, um,

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.910

 dead silent, obviously they might not wanna work with the person that

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.450
 they're gonna go work with. Or they could have had an issue, like

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.580
 earlier on in the day that you might wanna, like, figure out, um,

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.710
 those could be safety safety issues, right? If they don't wanna work

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.840
 together, so you need to figure out their loud voices or silent voices.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.980
 Um, something might be amiss, could just be the personality. But

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.110
