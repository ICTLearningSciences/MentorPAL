00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.210
the value that my my organization puts on education kind of various, depending

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.570
 on what rank you are when you're kind of in the younger sections.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.930
 Maybe like a third class or second class. It's something that

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.290
 me as a chief, I actually, like, take down If you've got all things

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.640
 being the same If you were ableto take college class or two, um, compared

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.000
 to other people in the unit, then ideo give you Ah, a bump on

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.360
 that on your evaluation Later on, you'll find that many chiefs already

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.720
 have their A's, Their bachelors, um, someone even have master's

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.080
 degrees. It doesn't necessarily have to do specifically with advancement,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.440
 but you kind of see that the the more responsibility you take

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.800
 on yourself to get education, the more people think of you in general.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.160
 Um, for awards, though, for instance, for sale of the quarter, Uh,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.520
 there is a block on there that says, um, hey, they completed their

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.880
 education requirements, um, such as, like they have your bachelor's

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.230
 or the masters, and it does give you a few points. Also, for your advancement

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.590
 exams, there's there's a part on there where, um, that deals

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.950
 with education as Well, if you wanted to keep going and let's say

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.310
 you want to become an officer, then you definitely need at least a

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.670
 bachelor's degree in orderto apply unless you're trying to become a

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.030
 chief warrant officer.
