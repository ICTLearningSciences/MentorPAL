00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.440
through the Navy. You get a lot of leadership opportunity ever since you

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.030
 joined. So you can be tutoring somebody you can actually be in charge

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.620
 of. Ah, a small group of cleaners and painters. Um, as you progress

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.210
 through the ranks of being a petty officer, um, those experiences

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.800
 grow more and more. So I think it really complicated in my whole

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.400
 experience when I became the training petty officer as a first class,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.990
 um, for the Navy Reserve, that was the, uh that's after eight years

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.580
 of being in the Navy Reserve. Then I switched over to being a civilian.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.170
 And then, um, during that first position, I was actually in charge

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.760
 of training 35 people on, um, how they learned what things were

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.350
 learning and whether they're keeping up, Um, and on track.
