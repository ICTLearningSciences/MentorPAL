Of course, this is a question that depends on what you're trying to do

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.620
 with it for the Navy. You don't need anything if you're trying to join

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.010
 the enlisted ranks. I didn't even have any idea about what electricity

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.390
 was basically on. My and I did just fine. Um, you can think of

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.780
 it just like preparation. The better you do at your degree, whether

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.170
 it's just a sheet of paper or you're really good student or you're

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.550
 like the most outstanding student, you know, those are all just preparation.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.940
 Um, and just because it's preparation, um, you just realize

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.320
 you're going to get that preparation no matter what, just by being

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.710
 in the service. So even if you don't have the degree, you could just

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.100
 simply replace that with time and in, you know, like after two years

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.480
 or three years, you could basically have just as much knowledge as

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.870
 somebody with a degree. Eso yeah, it could give you a boost ahead

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.250
 in life, whether it's, ah, where you're working for the Navy or civilian

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.640
 job. But don't depend on your your degree. It's ah, it's It could

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.030
 give you some kind of opportunity to learn things that you wouldn't

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.410
 have learned otherwise. Um, for instance, I took English classes

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.800
 and critical thinking classes I took, um, you know, debate classes.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.180
 But for the most part, those air just like internally, they increase

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.570
 my internal knowledge, but not necessarily my field.
