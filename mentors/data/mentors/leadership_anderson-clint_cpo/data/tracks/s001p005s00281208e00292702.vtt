00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.010
The first thing I look for is what is their level of knowledge? Can I

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.180
 give them a main inside them and then come back in 20 minutes and then

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.340
 it's complete? Um, that's kind of hard toe grass with the initial

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.500
 meeting. That's something that you kind of develop over the first couple

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.670
 of weeks. Third couple weeks. Um, the way that they communicate

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.830
 with you is the second is the second piece. Do they go off, do the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.990
 main inside them, and then you don't see them for the rest of the day?

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.160
 Do they go off and then come back and update you every now and then?

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.320
 Uh, do they also say like, Hey, please give me another roll. Please

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.480
 give me a more intense role. Or are they saying, hey, you know

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.650
 what? Like, um, I just wanna stay over here in the corner. What's the

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.810
 least amount of work that I could do for this eight hour long day?

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.970
 Uh, if he assigns me the pump, I can go do the pump, and then at the

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.140
 end of the day, then if it's done, then I'm good there. Other people

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.300
 that say, Hey, you know, I finished the pump. You know, before lunch.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.460
 Is there anything that you need after lunch? So the people that

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.630
 come to me with, you know, like additional responsibility requests

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.790
 Those are the ones that I I tryto, um, interact with the most.
