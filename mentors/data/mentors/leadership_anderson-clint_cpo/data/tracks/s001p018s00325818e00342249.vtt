WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.520
as a supervisor, I generally follow whatever the Navy guidelines are.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.180
 If it's banned by the Navy, then I ban it. If it's not, if it's allowed

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.850
 by the Navy, then I allow it. Um, there are some exceptions. So,

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.510
 for instance, let's say we have a sailor who just got a red badge or

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.180
 yellow badge. You know, they got caught drinking. They got caught

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.840
 staying out after curfew. And the Navy has these rules like, Hey, you

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.510
 know what? Like now, you're not supposed to be out after 11 o'clock.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.180
 In those cases, I'm a little bit mawr, um, more strict with them.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.840
 I say, Hey, you know what? Like if you get caught past caught, if you

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.510
 get caught out past 11 o'clock in, the name is going to do this.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.170
 So I suggest I strong suggest that you make it here by 10 o'clock. Eso

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.840
 That's like a personal thing that I do because I don't want them

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.500
 to ruin their career. You know, like if you're really strict on the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.170
 line and you know, even even if you're over like past two minutes, you

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.830
 know there's no there's no remorse for those guys, you know, and

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.500
 I know that those rules could be, like, really strict like that. You

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.170
 know, you could be, uh, going to jail for bread and water with bread

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.830
 and water. You know, I I don't wanna see anyone in those situations.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.500
 So I give them a buffer to help them with their careers. So that,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.160
 like, if they do go past my band, um, I don't have toe follow the Navy's

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.830
 rules. Whereas if they go back past the Navy's band, then I would

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.490
 definitely go pack, go through with the Navy's rules, you know?

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.160
 So I give him buffers, personal buffers.
