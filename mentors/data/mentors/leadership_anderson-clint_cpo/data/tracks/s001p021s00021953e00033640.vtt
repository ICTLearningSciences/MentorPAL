00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.120
there are local rules that inform you, um, how you can date? What's general

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.390
 is that you can't fat in eyes, which means that if you're in a

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.660
 supervisory position, you can't, um, date someone underneath you. So

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.930
 there are exceptions. So, for instance, let's say your first class

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.200
 can you date second classes. Well, it might depend on whether that

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.470
 second classes, um, on a different, um, like like a part of a different

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.740
 um, unit. Then you can tow Electrician's date. Well, if ah, first

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.010
 classes in, uh, reactor room one and the second classes in reactor

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.290
 room to even though they're a part of the same electrical division,

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.560
 maybe they can date. So, um, that that that's a little bit more flexible.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.830
 Um, what's not flexible is, for instance, if you're a chief,

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.100
 you can't really date people underneath you, so they actually have to

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.370
 get off the off the ship. Um, if you're an officer, you also can't

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.640
 date, um, enlisted people. Um, maybe officers can date each other,

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.910
 but for instance, they have to be separate. Basically, the rule is,

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.180
 um, within the chain of command. Nobody can, uh, anyone up the chain

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.450
 of command or below the chain of command. You have to actually have

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.720
 to be separate or you have to be off the ship.
