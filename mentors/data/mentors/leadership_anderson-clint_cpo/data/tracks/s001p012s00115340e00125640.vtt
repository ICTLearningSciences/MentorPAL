The best military perk that I keep experiencing is on Veterans Day. I

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.540
 usually go toe Applebee's, and they give you free food. Um, eat all

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.390
 the chicken wings. Um, get a drink. Obviously, I tip the waiter pretty

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.230
 well, but it's really great to know that, like, there at least for

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.080
 one day from the year all of America sits down and shows appreciation

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.930
 for us because I did, you know, sacrifice a lot. I sacrifice my

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.770
 youth. You know, I sacrifice me meeting my significant other. I sacrifice

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.620
 my my my health, my knees, my, my ears, You write all those things

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.470
 and yeah, the payment isn't, uh, outstanding. It did set me up,

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.310
 but I think you could classify that as, Ah, sacrifice. And Veterans

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.160
 Day is kind of like America's way of saying, Yeah, we know what you

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.000
 did. Um, it's not enough. But you know what? Here's a little bit of

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.850
 a little token of our appreciation, and it makes me feel proud.
