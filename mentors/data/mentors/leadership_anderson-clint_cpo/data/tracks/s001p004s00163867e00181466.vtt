00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.850
I was in Germany for three years. When I was in the fifth grade. I remember

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.850
 being with my father's mother, my grandmother and he was in the

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.850
 Army. I heard that this guy, you know, was in Kaiserslautern, and

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.850
 he was coming to pick us up. Me and my brother and I remember him walking

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 in tow, my classroom in fifth grade and just me being so proud.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.850
 And maybe everyone had known. I I told him that he was gonna come

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.850
 and he came and picked me up. And I felt, um, exceptional. At that time,

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.850
 I went over to Germany and being with him on the American base

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.850
 was those were some of the best years of my life. I I still think about

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 them constantly, even even today, Um, everyone had, uh, good things

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.850
 and nice food, and we were standing in apartment. But it's a good

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.850
 place for me, you know? Like, I think I had my own room at one time,

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.840
 you know? And that had never happened before. Before that I was always

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.840
 sleep in the same bed is my brother. Um, yeah. Everything was

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.840
 clean and pristine. He had a Corvette outside um, So I did that for

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.840
 two years, from the middle of fifth grade to the middle of seventh grade,

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.840
 and then he got out of the military and he start working for I

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.840
 think IBM or something for Germany were living with his girlfriend.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.840
 So then we started staying in, um, in in her house with her daughter,

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.840
 and that was a nice little house. And I started going to a German

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.840
 school. We spoke German and on almost no one spoke English. So I had

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.840
 to, like, really, uh, commit myself to the community. And I did that

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.840
 for a year. So I left after my eighth and a half year, and it came

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.840
 back to the States.
