00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.840
as a supervisor, it's really important to understand your crew. You have

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.820
 to know about their past. You have to know their behaviors. You know,

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.810
 what type of person are they? Are they sweet and kind? Are they

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.790
 angry? And it's important to notice changes. So if there's a risk of

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.780
 suicide, then, um, I take all of that into consideration and make

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.770
 sure that I get them to the experts. Uh, this could be whether, um,

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.750
 they're more violent than usual, whether they're punching things where

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.740
 they're hurting, whether they're hurting other people. Um, whether

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.720
 something happens in their life. Whether, like, for instance, their

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.710
 wife just, um walked out of the house or the kids are having problems

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.690
 at school or they were having an argument with the next door neighbor.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.680
 You know, those are things that, if you hear about you, should

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.670
 take those into consideration and be it something really big, like,

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.650
 ah, huge argument with a co worker or little things throughout the

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.640
 last few weeks, a few months that you think might have some some significance.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.620
 Um, you make the call as a supervisor toe, bring it up to

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.610
 the next level
