00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.030
where you live is really going to affect your approach to the job. I know

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.210
 some people who were station, um, nothing against Livermore. But

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.390
 they said Livermore, and it just wasn't the place for them. They said

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.570
 they hated it. And I can understand if the location doesn't have

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.750
 all the resources that you're expecting. A roller skating rink. Ah,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.930
 good school. Ah, ah, Lake. If you feel like going into the ocean, um,

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.120
 the temperature that you're expecting, all those things can really

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.300
 affect affect you outside of work as well as inside. And so in general,

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.480
 you're not able to choose where you go. Um, it all depends on,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.660
 you know, your family structure and how happy you are, toe Just live

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.840
 in a new place. But yeah, it can really affect your performance. Really

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.020
 affect your family. Who hasn't, you know, nothing to do with the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.200
 military s. So you want to take those things into account
