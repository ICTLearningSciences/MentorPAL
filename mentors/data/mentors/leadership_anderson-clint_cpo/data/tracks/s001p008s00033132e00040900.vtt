00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.620
being a student here at the Naval Postgraduate School. They tend to work

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.390
 you a lot. Um, maybe about four hours, at least per day for lectures.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.150
 And then you're gonna have about two hours mawr of homework. Now,

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.920
 if you cut it off at that time, then you're your grades. They tend

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.690
 to be pretty generous with grades, but you don't. You're not gonna

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.460
 learn as much as you could have if you like, double that amount of

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.230
 time. So if you are working about 12 hours per day, which I think some

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.990
 days are, then that gives you about, like, four or five hours per

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.760
 day toe, um, kind of do your own thing. Your weekends are always free.
