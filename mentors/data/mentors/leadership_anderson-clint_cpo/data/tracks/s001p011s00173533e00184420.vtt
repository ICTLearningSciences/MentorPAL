00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.440
the leadership styles that are dying out most recently are the ones that,

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.030
 um, have the leader just think that they know it all, and they're

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.620
 just depending on their rate, Thio be correct. Um, as it turns out

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.220
 right now, you know, you have a second class who's like, really, really

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.810
 knowledgeable. Um, they could be considered the leader. And when

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.400
 compared to, like another first class or chief in some cases like

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.990
 that, that second class could be right. That's because there's been,

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.580
 ah, big boosting knowledge recently. Um, we have the Internet. We have

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.170
 smarter people coming in. We have, ah, bigger, bigger pool of people

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.760
 to work with. So you can't just depend on your laurels anymore.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.350
 You can't depend on your experience anymore. You actually have to look

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.950
 at the person and for me chewing out somebody. Um, just because

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.540
 I'm, uh, une seven and they did something wrong? Uh, that's that's not

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.130
 flying anymore, actually, have toe see why they are doing the whatever

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.720
 they're doing wrong. And then, um, adjust my leadership
