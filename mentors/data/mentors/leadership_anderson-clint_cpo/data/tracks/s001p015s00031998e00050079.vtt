00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.230
When you talk about the way that my work can change the world, you have

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.620
 to look at it. Um, with the broad lynch, I'm in the military and the

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.000
 military's job is thio police, the world basically, of course, American

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.380
 citizens and to make sure that we maintain our quality of life.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.770
 But, um, there are many other countries that can't defend themselves

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.150
 and a zoo long as you go in with the right mindset, you know, trying

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.530
 to do the right thing, then help those guys out when they wouldn't

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.910
 be able to defend themselves. Otherwise, that's that's also like,

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.300
 um, very honorable, I think ast faras being a nuke. Um, basically,

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.680
 we were an operator for the most, for the most part. So we get our

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.060
 pilots to the middle of the Pacific Ocean, and those pilots are the

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.450
 ones who actually, um, defend the country and do the attacking where

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.830
 it's needed for our marines. So, um, it feels good to be a part of

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.210
 that support role. Um, right now I'm in the Naval Postgraduate School

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.600
 and I'm studying cybersecurity. I have a focus on research, so I'm

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.980
 hoping that some of the things that I'm learning. The two years that

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.360
 I'm gonna be here is going to combine with the thesis that I'll do

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.740
 and maybe the research, um, job that I'll have later on so that we

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.130
 have better, uh, cryptography or we have, um ah, more robust I t network

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.510
 infrastructure. I'm not exactly sure how I'm going to make my mark

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.890
 in the cybersecurity world, but I'm learning the things that it

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.280
 takes and I'm trying toe, you know, put myself in the position toe change

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.660
 the world on a global scale.
