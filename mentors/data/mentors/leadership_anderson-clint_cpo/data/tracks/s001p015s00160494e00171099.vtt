00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.740
I spent my bonus. I think it was $40,000. I got a tax free and I purchased

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.620
 my house with that, and that was a pretty wise investment. I still

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.510
 have the houses to this day, and I think, uh, it's gonna go ahead

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.390
 and him with my retirement. Um, other people they spent their car

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.280
 on, I think, for for our nuclear enlistment bonus, we got like, uh,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.160
 some people got $12,000. I used my cash. I used mine for to go to school.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.050
 I think I got $50,000 for tuition assistance. But other people,

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.930
 they didn't want the education and they just got the Marine 12,000

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.820
 bucks. And next thing you know, we just barely joined and they're driving

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.700
 around in a new, uh 300 ZX or something. And I would say that

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.590
 that's a bad investment because it depreciates in value. But you can't

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.470
 convince them of that. They were having the time of their lives.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.360
 And, uh, while I'm driving around in my eclipse, they're getting all

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.240
 the girls and going to all the parties and stuff in there. They're

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.130
 beautiful car, so I think they probably think it's worth it. So it

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.010
 depends on your personal style. What you want to spend your money on
