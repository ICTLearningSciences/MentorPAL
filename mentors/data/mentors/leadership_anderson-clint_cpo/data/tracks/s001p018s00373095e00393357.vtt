00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.230
being in the Navy as long as I have been in for going on 20 years. Uh,

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.610
 you have to realize that the Navy changes all the time. There is No,

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.990
 um, there's always a right and wrong, especially like, based on guidelines.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.370
 But that right and wrong changes with time. Um, for instance,

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.750
 you know, really, a long time ago there was a separate. They were

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.130
 separate, paid between blacks and whites. And now there's not so laws

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.510
 can change and temperaments can change and emotions can change,

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.890
 and the navy changes accordingly. Um, I know that when I when I first

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.270
 joined, um, there weren't that many transsexuals in the Navy and the

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.650
 people that are that were in the Navy had a strong had strong opinions

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.030
 about that. Those same people. I'm still one of them, right? They

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.410
 have to realize that we made rules for them, And some people just

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.790
 don't wanna change their minds so so drastically. They still have

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.170
 their their opinions about the way that it used to be. So, um, your

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.540
 whole goal as a supervisor is to get those people informed about the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.920
 new rules about like how they have to change about how their career

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.300
 might be in jeopardy if they don't make that change. Um, another another

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.680
 one is PTSD, you know, like we had our opinions about that. Maybe

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.060
 we thought that those people, um, were violent and aggressive, and

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.440
 they don't deserve to have the same, um, resource is that other people

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.820
 had. Now we realize that it deals with mental health, and we should

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.200
 think of it as think, Think of their situation, mawr in a kind

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.580
 of light. Let's say so. We have to make sure that, um for the people

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.960
 with the old way of thinking, they have to get on board with the new

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.340
 way of thinking. And as a supervisor, your your whole role is to

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.720
 understand what the policies are. Um, understand. When you have someone

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.100
 who still thinks the old way and just train them to make sure that

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.480
 they're there, they're more informed
