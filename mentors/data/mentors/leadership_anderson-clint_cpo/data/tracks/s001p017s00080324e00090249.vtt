on most ships, there's at least a chaplain who can help you deal with

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.750
 some some of the emotions that you're going through. Um, if you're dealing

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.700
 with grief for loss, you can talk to them and most of the communication

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.650
 with them. It's gonna be anonymous, so you can feel free

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.600
 to say whatever you want to without thoughts of repercussion later on.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.550

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.300
 that. Um, if something sexual happen to you, then that's a an occasion

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.250
 that you have lots of grief or loss or um, or kind of high, high

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.200
 emotions and, uh, TVs, the victim's advocate or the SAARC's um, they

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.150

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.100
