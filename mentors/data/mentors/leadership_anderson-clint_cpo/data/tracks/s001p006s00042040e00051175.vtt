00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.800
when I was really young, I was a really good student. I did all my homework.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.750
 I was basically straight a student up until I got into high school.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.700
 Um, after I joined high school, I didn't really have a good relationship

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.650

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.600

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.400
 wants to stay home. So it just fell off the off the rails eso. After

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.350
 I joined the Navy, I started becoming a much better student. We joined

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.300
 the Nuclear Propulsion School, and they really, uh, intensely

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.250
 grill you every single day, so that then I shot back up to being a perfect

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.200
 student. At that time,
