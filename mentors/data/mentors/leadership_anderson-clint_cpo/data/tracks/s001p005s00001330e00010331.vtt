00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.020
My ideal team is a diverse team. What I mean by that is you have to have

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.190
 a superstar that that that is, uh, e think that builds the most morale.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.350
 When you have someone on the team that can probably do anything

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.520
 now he needs support. Uh, there's a guy that's learning. So if I

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.690
 had two superstars thin, what I would try to do is I would try to get

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.860
 one of the superstars off and try to get someone who's learning, you

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.020
 know, kind of keep it balanced. There should always be some kind

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.190
 of training involved as well. Um, uh, you got your admin guy, you know,

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.360
 that that's usually me or some kind of supervisor or something like

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.530
 that. And then, um, yeah, I think as long as you have those three

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.690
 pieces that are really good or at least learning, uh, then everything

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.860
 else is kind of like filter
