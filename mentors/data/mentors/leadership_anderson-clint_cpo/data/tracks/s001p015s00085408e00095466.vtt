00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.640
owning versus renting is something that's really going to depend on where

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.420
 you're going Going. Thio. I bought my first house when I was in

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.210
 Washington, and the house prices were pretty good. I think I I bought

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.990
 mine for 300,000 and the rates were actually pretty high. Um, you

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.780
 also wanna think about how long you going to stay there? So you have

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.570
 to stay there for at least two years if you're going to sell the house

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.350
 pretty soon and, um, not pay capital gains taxes, so things could

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.140
 change. Obviously, these are all things that you might wanna discuss

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.930
 with, um, attorney or some kind of lawyer who might give you better

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.710
 information. Um, but you might wanna think about the prices, how

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.500
 long you're gonna be staying there. You're going to stay there for a

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.280
 long time. Then generally, it's it's always better toe by, um if you're

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.070
 gonna just stay there for, let's say, uh, two or three years on

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.860
 Lee and then you're sure that you're gonna leave from the state than

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.640
 you might want to be renting, um, somewhere, um, above three years,

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.430
 but below 10 years. Say, uh, you might want to consider owning
