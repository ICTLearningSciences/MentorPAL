00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.790
as a mostly single guy. I've always been satisfied with any place that

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.730
 I've ever lived. When I was on active duty, um, you could find me,

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.660
 like, just living on on a basic bunk, and that was good enough for me.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.600
 Eventually buy houses. And, um, yeah, there were five bedroom, 3000

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.540
 square feet, house houses, But yeah, I just found myself just living

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.480
 in the living room. Um, so yeah, any place has been good enough

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.410
 for me, but from what I've seen from people who have been traveling

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.350
 around with your family Yeah, if you have three kids, then you wanna

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.290
 at least a three bedroom house. If you have dogs and cats, then you

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.230
 want at least backyard. Um, some people actually don't stay on the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.160
 military housing because its's not quite what they're looking for, and

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.100
 they stay off base. But it depends on your command, whether they

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.040
 allow something like that or not.
