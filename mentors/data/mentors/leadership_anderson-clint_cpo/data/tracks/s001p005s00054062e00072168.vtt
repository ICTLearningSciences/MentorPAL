00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.590
one good way is to have things outside of the work. So, for instance,

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.340
 if there are morale, recreation and warfare things that you can do together,

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.080
 um, that would be helpful. Um, one thing that I used to like

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.820
 to do is like, exercise together, saying, Hey, you know what? This

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.560
 Friday afternoon, uh, let's put on a PT gear and just, like, run together.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.310
 Um, if it's an easy Friday, then let's go out and play some

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.050
 volleyball together. Um, you don't really have that much opportunity

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.790
 to do that. Let's say Let's it, let's say if you're underway, then,

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.540
 um, there aren't any weekends on the beach. So what do you do then?

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.280
 Well, you have to make sure that the team has enough enough material

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.020
 outside of the work so that they can actually communicate with each

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.770
 other. Um, in a friendly way. That means make sure that they have

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.510
 enough movies. If they if they were complaining about their lunch, making

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.250
 sure that they're well fed, you know, go talk to the galleys,

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.990
 remember and say, Hey, you know what? We have this birthday coming up.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.740
 Can you bring a birthday cake in Thio to celebrate somebody's, um,

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.480
 somebody's birthday. You could actually have this award, you know,

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.220
 before you weren't really considered an award, but saying, Hey, you

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.970
 know what? Like it would really lift the spirits off the unit, help

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.710
 somebody with promotion. Let me think of how I can, uh, come up with

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.450
 an award, you know, make some kind of jobs so that they can get that

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.200
 award when you wouldn't have thought so. Otherwise. Like, there are

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.940
 many avenues that you have toe, Um, just not shove work down people's

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.680
 throats and say, Hey, you know what? Like we're in a team. I know

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.420
 this place is really long. You're sweating a lot, but let's figure

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.170
 out something else that you can do toe actually smile once once in

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.910
 a while.
