00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.280
Ah, pivotal moment in my career. I think most people who are chiefs would

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.700
 say the time that they became a chief the time that they got accepted.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.130
 But I would say that it actually came a few years before that

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.560
 when I when I made first class. Uh, that's the time that I think I've

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.980
 been in for maybe six years. And I had recently had a bolt in the

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.410
 road where I didn't get accepted. I missed the first class exam by,

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.840
 like, 60.1%. Um, uh, yeah, it is very, very close, you know, like anything,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.270
 if I would have gotten an award or like maybe one more point

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.690
 on my evil, anything would have would have bump me up to the to the

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.120
 next rank. So by that next time actually took a weekend, um, and study

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.550
 for the exam. It's the first time that I did, and I remember going

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.970
 through the books, seeing like what you're supposed to study and

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.400
 like circling things and like on a sheet of paper, you know, like,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.830
 um, writing down things that that I needed to memorize. It's kind of

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.250
 like a nuclear power school. I think I spent, like, eight hours per

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.680
 day. Um, for those three days. And then by the time I got the the recommendation,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.110
 I think I scored in the top 99% of nuclear propulsion

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.530
 engineers, and I kind of saw you know what? Like the power of self

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.960
 studying, it actually really does. Guide, um, your progress. And I think

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.390
 I still hold on to that. I now, based on what I did and the amount

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.820
 of effort that the the positive result that I saw for myself, I

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.240
 can now confidently tell my other people Hey, you know, if you study,

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.670
 you will most likely see success. And I mean that instead of just,

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.100
 like, maybe, uh, chit chat from other people who maybe haven't studied,

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.520
 but just kind of say like, Hey, you know what it za right thing

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.950
 to do. So I have experience with that myself.
