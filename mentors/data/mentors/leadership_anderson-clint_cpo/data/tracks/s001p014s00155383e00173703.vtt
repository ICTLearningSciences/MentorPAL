00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.820
I experienced many failures. Um, all the time. The one that I'm most unhappy

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.790
 with is what? When I tried to apply it to the Naval Academy and

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.760
 didn't get accepted, I think another failure that I had, at least,

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.730
 um, academically is when I was at Berkeley and I didn't go home and

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.700
 read all the chapters. You know, they say, like, this is how you succeed,

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.670
 you know, read this and do this, you know? And I didn't really

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.630
 push myself as hard as I should have. And that lasted my whole career.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.600
 Sometimes I did. You know, sometimes I was, you know, during the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.570
 weekend, I just like reading, reading code and code. But other weekends,

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.540
 I just, you know, like I got a C or a B on a test. And, you

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.510
 know, like, I feel like, Hey, you know what? I should have really pushed

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.480
 myself a little bit harder during that time. But the failures that

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.450
 I have currently are the ones that are that I'm most unhappy with

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.420
 Andi. This means as a chief, um, you have people under you and I I

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.390
 felt them all the time. I try it. You know my hardest. I tryto get

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.360
 them awards and they don't get accepted for I try to get them promoted

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.330
 and they don't get, um, the the credit that they that they want.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.300
 I try to write the most fair evaluation that I that I can and some of

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.270
 the ones that have the lower ones, you know, I have to explain. And

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.230
 then they walked out the room and I say, Hey, how did you try to change

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.200
 him? Did you try to get that? You know that three point. Oh, upto

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.170
 a four point. Oh, Did you give them all the tools that were necessary

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.140
 so he could succeed? And yeah, this is constant. So, um, you're

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.110
 still happen all the time, But, you know, you live with them and you

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.080
 have to just think that you tried toe do the best that you could

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.050
 during the time
