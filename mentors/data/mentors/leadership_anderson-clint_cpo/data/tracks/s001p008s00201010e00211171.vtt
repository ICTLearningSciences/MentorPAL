00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.590
The biggest conflict that I experienced myself was just the distance at

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.330
 the time, we didn't really used laptop so much. Um, around the 2000

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.070
 to 2005 frame, Um, I just barely had my first laptop, and I think

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.810
 we had a well at the time. So we didn't have all the tools like Skype

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.550
 and Facebook that we have right now. And I think people are still

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.290
 using letters at that time. So, um ah, large, large part of my military

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.020
 service, Uh, when I was active, duty was spent overseas. That's

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.760
 one of the reasons that my family didn't follow me. So, um, trying to

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.500
 call back home, uh, waiting in a long line. You know, maybe two hours.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.240
 You finally get to the to the pay phone on this ship, and then

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.980
 you use the card and thio kind of like catch up it Z not the same as

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.720
 just being there in person. So I think that that was a really big challenge

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.460
 that I had to overcome, um, from being in the service
