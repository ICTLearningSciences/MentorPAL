WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.580
some things that I'm doing right now that I never thought that I would

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.300
 be doing, um, you can take the last place that I was on the USS Blue

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.030
 Ridge now being ah, nuclear electrician's mate. I was basically in

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.750
 the plants for the most time, for the most part, and, you know, kind

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.480
 of supervising down there. And I hadn't done that for about eight

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.210
 years. So I thought, Well, once I joined the reserves, Well, that's

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.930
 gonna be one of last times that I'm actually dealing with, like, controlling

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.660
 what gets fixed and how it gets fixed. But yeah, I just recently

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.390
 on the USS Blue Ridge, I found myself even as reserve chief, overseeing

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.110
 a group of 15 electrician's, and we actually were in charge

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.840
 of fixing the whole entire ship from the bottom of the hole all the

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.560
 way to the top. Massive antenna. Um, I was in the radar room. I was

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.290
 in the navigation room. I was up on Vulture's row. I was dealing with

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.020
 how to fix the didn't fix the helicopters, but how to do the electrical

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.740
 checks on the helicopters. These are things that I never thought

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.470
 that I would be, um, uh, that I would have to deal with. But, um,

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.200
 the Navy Reserve actually gives you an opportunity to deal with things

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.920
 that you that air new. As long as you have some of the prior leadership

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.650
 qualities. And as long as you know some basics about it. Electricity

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.370
 deal with electricity things, then, um then they could put

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.100
 you anywhere.
