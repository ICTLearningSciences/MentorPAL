00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.710
the question that I wish I would have asked earlier earlier. Um, that

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.560
 was a really big surprise to me. Is the difference between the different

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.420
 ranks? Um, you have pity officers, then you have chiefs, and then

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.280
 you have officers and, um, they're split by whether you have a bachelor's

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.140
 degree and whether you've been commissioned. And I didn't really

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.990
 understand that critical piece until, like, well, in tow. After

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.850
 the time that I joined the join the service, um, for instance, people

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.710
 were being called Chiefs and Master Chiefs while I was in boot camp.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.560
 They were saying, Well, you know, like if we don't do these certain

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.420
 things, there's certain things that, um, things first class is

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.280
 gonna make a chief and I didn't really understand, Like how you were

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.140
 supposed to be promoted along the lines of the military. Um, being

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.990
 a kid, I just thought, all right, your private I knew what that was,

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.850
 and I heard that there was an admiral and I knew what that was. And

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.710
 I thought you just joined. And then you just stay in. You get better

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.560
 and better and better at your job, and then you're finally you know

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.420
 an admiral or something. I had no idea about the rank structure. But

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.280
 now I know that separated by, um books and learning and degrees and

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.140
 evaluation marks and awards Eso I wish that would have been, uh,

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.990
 clarified even before I joined the service. Um eh, so that I could have

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.850
 a better idea of the structure of what I'm getting into.
