00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.290
I'm an electrician's mate. Chief. The electrician's mate means that I'm

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.730
 an expert, um, for electrical operations for electrical maintenance.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.180
 Um, I think that I can handle that pretty well. I'm a chief, which

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.620
 means that, um, I handle the unit. I handle the operations that we

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.060
 do the minutes that we do, but also, um, the day to day, um, activities.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.500
 So if they need training, um, if they need other things like that

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.940
 Now, what I'm not an expert in is anything outside of that. So,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.380
 for instance, security. You put it up to the security manager, Um, let

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.830
 the experts do their job and specifically sexual things. Um, um,

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.270
 emotional things for the sexual part. We have the victim's advocate.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.710
 We have the, uh, sexual assault coordinator. Um, you refer your people

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.150
 to them for the psychological. We have the psychological health

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.590
 operation specialists. You referred to them, you know, like things dealing

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.030
 with suicide as soon as you hear it. Um, that that someone might

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.480
 be considering that. Say, Well, you know, as a chief, that's where

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.920
 my role ends. You know, he's in my unit. My goal from that point

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.360
 on is to make sure that that person is safe because as electrician's,

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.800
 you know, safety is number one always on my mind and then get that

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.240
 person to the correct, um, psychological health outreach person. So,

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.680
 um yeah, other than the obvious ones, it's a case by case thing. Um,

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.130
 if people are belligerent, you have to realize, like whether you

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.570
 can handle that in house or if you have to send that up to the to the

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.010
 MPs, um, think things like that.
