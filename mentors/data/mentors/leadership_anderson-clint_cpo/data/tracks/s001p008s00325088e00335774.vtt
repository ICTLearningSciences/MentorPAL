00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.030
military vacation is, uh, well needed. Rest from all the work that you've

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.210
 been doing. Especially if you just came back from deployment. I

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.390
 remember some of my vacations Where, um, maybe two weeks. And that's

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.560
 when I I would drive from a South Carolina toe Michigan, and just hang

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.740
 out. Just leave the Navy behind. I think I spent another, um, semester

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.920
 learning another language in Monterey. I took a flight, and then

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.100
 I think I spent maybe, uh, 2.5 months from saved up leave toe to

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.280
 go and you know, like just leaving behind, learn another language and

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.460
 then come back. So you get about a month every single year of of

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.640
 saved up leave. If you go like 33 years or four years, um, then that

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.820
 can start to accumulate. So generally they expect you to take about

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.990
 two weeks per year. But if you talk to the right people and especially

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.170
 if if you're on a downtime at your current command, then you can

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.350
 extend it. Like I said, I actually went to college for a while as well.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.530
 So you just have toe being good communication with your supervisors.
