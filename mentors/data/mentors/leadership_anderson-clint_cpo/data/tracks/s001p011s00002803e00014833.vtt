WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.670
my leadership stout, you could say, is unique because it has my personal

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.500
 flavor. But honestly, Ah, lot of the Chiefs. We don't want our our

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.320
 leadership style to be unique. We want it to be similar. We wanna

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.150
 always teach the same way. That said, um, you can add your own flavor

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.970
 to it. So we all learn that we treated Listen, you know, that's the

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.790
 most important thing we all learned. To be fair, we all learned toe

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.620
 go up the correct chain of command. You know, we all learned to keep

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.440
 personal problems personal, private, private, private problems are

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.260
 really, really not supposed to be shared with other people. And you

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.090
 supposed to keep it between you and the other person, right? All of

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.910
 those are, you know, that's 80% of the counseling that we ever do

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.740
 Now, The leadership that we do, um that is unique has a has to do with

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.560
 our personality. So I like to be generally friendly and fun and have

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.380
 a smile on my face all the time. Um, other chiefs, they might be

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.210
 very, very strict and, like, you know, like, you know, like the hard

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.030
 guys, you know, other people might be really sweet and kind, you know,

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.850
 carrying or you can go to him with anything. Eso my mind is kind

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.680
 of You can come to me with anything. You can tap me on the shoulder,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.500
 pull you to the side, but I'm letting you know that's not very, very

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.330
 unique. I'm hoping that there are many, many chiefs out there that

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.150
 are like me.
