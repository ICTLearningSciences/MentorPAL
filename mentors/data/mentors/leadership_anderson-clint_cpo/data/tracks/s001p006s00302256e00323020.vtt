00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.840
When I first joined the Navy, they were trying to promote the Nuclear

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.830
 Propulsion School and they threw a lot of things on my desk. We'll we'll

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.820
 give you lots of money for school, which they did, and I've I've

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.800
 sucked it all up after you get out of Navy, then you can have $100,000

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.790
 your job. And being a kid that was currently working at McDonald's,

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.780
 that sounded great. You know, like, uh, now I can have that $100,000

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.770
 your job. No problem. Um, they said, Oh, you know, you become

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.760
 a veteran and you go to the Post Graduate School and they provide a

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.750
 lot of different things. But to tell you the truth, all of those kind

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.730
 of sift into the back to the background. Um, I'm still the name of

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.720
 this at this time, and I didn't become a nuclear, um, operator. At

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.710
 the end, however, I did get the challenge that they were talking about.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.700
 That's the thing that really drove me tojoin the nuclear propulsion

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.690
 school. And that's the thing that I think I got the most out of.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.680
 I was challenged more than I ever had been in my life, and that's something

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.670
 that you can't put a price on And that that's a job that I

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.650
 don't think that most of the other jobs that I saw the Navy wouldn't

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.640
 provide as much as, um, after getting out of the active duty service,

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.630
 I was a chief. And, of course, I love, you know, providing opportunities

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.620
 for people and helping them promote their career, You know,

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.610
 like all chiefs will say that. But what I personally like for myself

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.600
 about being, um, still in the Navy reserves is to travel. I did a lot

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.580
 of port calls when I was in active duty. And I'm telling you, I went

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.570
 to 13 different countries. Uh, Dubai, Bahrain. Kuwait, um, Japan,

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.560
 You know, dozens of places, but being in the reserve, you actually

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.550
 go to these places. They give you a car, they give you a hotel. Uh,

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.540
 they give you a decent work, they give you money in your pocket and

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.530
 on the weekends you can explore. So I've seen New York and the capital

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.510
 and, um, New Hampshire, places that I didn't think that I would

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.500
 go for a long time. I've seen Washington and you know, swimming the

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.490
 beaches of Hawaii, and they say that I'm working. That's that's incredible

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.480
 because I think that it's kind of like a or work vacation.
