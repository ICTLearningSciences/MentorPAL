WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.310
on the USS Stennis. I came in as, Ah, Petty officer, third class. I was,

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.780
 um, during that role. You're basically in charge of just kind of

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.240
 learning for the first couple of months. So going down in the plants

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.700
 kind of give me a feel for the layout of the of each level of where

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.160
 the components are and training Thio for your first watch stations

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.630
 that could take up thio maybe four months or so After you get your first

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.090
 watch, you do that job sporadically, you know, maybe every day.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.550
 But it could be like maybe five hours of watch standing, uh, in one

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.010
 role. That's log recorder. Um, that was the first job that I had. That's

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.480
 when you look at lots of gauges and you make sure that everything

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.940
 is within specifications. If something's out respect, then you tell

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.400
 the watch officer Hey, you know what? I'm down here at this up for

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.870
 long recorder. You're actually in an enclosed environment with the

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.330
 officer, So you kind of just look over and say, Hey, you know what?

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.790
 I'm reading this high temperature on this pump or high voltage on

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.250
 this turbine generator s so it's kind of simple at at the beginning.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.720
 Uh, the other times you're actually giving physical hands toe work.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.180
 So, for instance, let's say you have to clean out, um, a turbine generator

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.640
 or change out a pump or supposed to change out some light bulbs.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.110
 Um, you do that for about a year, kind of easy work until you become

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.570
 maybe a second class, and that's when you start getting higher

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.030
 quality works. You, um, get higher positioned, um, watch stations.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.490
 So propulsion Electrician's he his job is toe walk from level to level,

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.960
 looking at different gauges and oil and voltages and current making

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.420
 sure everything's inspect, making sure there's no fires anywhere,

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.880
 making sure there's no smells going wrong. Um, after you do that,

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.340
 then you become a throttle hman. Um, that's another, um, later on, watch

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.810
 where you you have this little will in front of you. And there

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.270
 is a throttle man for every single, um, shaft. So you could be like

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.730
 shaft number one, and then you get ah, command from the navigation that

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.200
 says, Hey, you know what? We need to go all ahead two thirds full

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.660
 flank and you just open it up or set it down, uh, to make sure that,

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.120
 uh, ship starts going faster. Um, later on, Um, actually, for the

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.580
 for the unit. I was I think I deal with training. I was, um, uh, an

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.050
 lpo for supply division for a while. Um, yeah. Yeah. Just basic maintenance

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.510
 mechanic for the whole time.
