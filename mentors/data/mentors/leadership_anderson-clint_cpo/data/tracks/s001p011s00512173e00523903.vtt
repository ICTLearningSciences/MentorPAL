If you wanna work smarter, then figure out who the superstars in your

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.580
 unit are and then tag team. Um, mentor. I know you might be tasked with

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.450
 only two Simon's for that day. Go fix this pump. Go change this

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.310
 file. But if you want to be one of the best, then you probably wanna

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:20.180
 tag team along with the person who's rolling out the cable to see how

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.040
 he's doing it. The person who's opening the breaker to see how he's

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.910
 doing it in the morning, at least for Electrician's. They're going

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.770
 to say, Well, we're going to do X Y. And we're also going to use this

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.640
 crazy weird, um, maintenance item. Now you're not gonna be tasked

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.500
 with doing all of that stuff, right? Um, but if they say, hey, you

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.370
 know what, That crazy weird item I've never done that before. You might

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.230
 want to take it upon yourself to do your task and then go check

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.100
 that thing out A T end. There'll be a lot of times that they would

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.960
 be like the low dispatcher whose, uh, switching all the breakers and

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.830
 stuff, right. He's going to do some some crazy, um, item that is done

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.690
 on Lee once per month. Um, in that case, yeah, all the new people

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.560
 they gather around the low dispatcher is like, Okay, nine o'clock.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.420
 And then they're going to see exactly how he does it. See the casualty

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.290
 procedure? Right? So if you do that enough, then you will become

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.150
 an expert eventually.
