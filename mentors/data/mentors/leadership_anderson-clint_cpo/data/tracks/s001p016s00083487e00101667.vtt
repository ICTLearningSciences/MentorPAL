00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.920
the most important things on a resume. Our the things you put down for

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.990
 your experience, we want to be really concise. We want you to say that

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.070
 you worked at this unit or this shop on this ship and maybe like

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.140
 two or three, um, lines about, like a concisely what you did. Um, And

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.210
 the longer that is, the better it is. So one thing I have to say

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.280
 is, um let's say for me I was on, uh, the USS John C. Stennis and I

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.350
 was on there actually longer than I should have been. I did a six year

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.430
 tour. So for my block, it's gonna say USS John C. Stennis for six

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.500
 years. And of course, I did multiple things on there. Um, I was three

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.570
 and coordinator. I was, uh, lpo of of another unit. I was I covered

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.640
 all of the watches, but in the end, it's just ah, paragraph. You

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.710
 know, maybe a long paragraph. But it's just 11 in general, so it's better

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.790
 to have multiple ships. Um, the more things that you can do them

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.860
 or training that you can do if you could get a C school in there.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.930
 That's going to be another block. If you can stand a watch for another

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.000
 unit, that's gonna be another block. If you can qualify, uh, something

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.070
 that's out of your rate rather than become propulsion Electrician's

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.150
 let's say for like three years, um, split it up, say, Propulsion

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.220
 Electrician's for a year and a half and then, hey, you know what?

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.290
 Like let me try to qualify what works in a supervisor instead, and

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.360
 that's gonna be another block. So you're talking about quantity over

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.430
 the quality of the job because the quality in the Navy, they expect

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.510
 you to be proficient, vastly proficient at your job. So the longer

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.580
 you do it, it doesn't count. You have to, like, take something and

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.650
 then keep moving.
