00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.000
one of the most important things that achieve can learn is, uh, to know

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.150
 your people. That's one of the best piece of advice that Chief can

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.310
 have. So you always have to, like, change your your tone based on the

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.460
 person that you're facing. So if you're facing, uh, a really stand

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.610
 up guy who really knows his things, you can talk straight to him.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.760
 You don't have to, like, filter your words. It all you can say, Hey,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.910
 you know what? Like we need you to do this, you're not doing it or

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.070
 we need you to do this. And you've been great at it. You know, you could

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.220
 just, like, filter out just fine. There are other people who, like

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.370
 are very you know, you say three things to them and they start crying

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.520
 in a corner, right? You want them toe slowly change there. They're

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.670
 mode to beam or strong, but you definitely don't want to scam away.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.830
 So, like you also have to like, modify your words. You can't use

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.980
 stronger words you have tow. Um, slowly build up to the thing that

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.130
 you want to say. You know what? Hey, you know what we need you up there.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.280
 Um, toe paint. Now, if you just said, Hey, you're gonna do this,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.440
 go up there and paint, you know, with one person, that would be just

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.590
 fine. Okay, Sure. No problem, Chief, With this new person, it's

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.740
 like why they have to do that. I was just up there three days ago, and

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.890
 I was up there last month. And how come you didn't choose? You know,

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.040
 joy over there, you know, he's not doing anything, so rather than,

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.200
 you know, say it the same way and have them be mad at you being up

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.350
 there possibly angry, you know, causing danger to themselves. You

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.500
 might have to, like, give them a little bit more explanation about why

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.650
 it is what Joey is doing. Um, there's a time for that, you know,

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.800
 explain what joy is doing. Uh, but it would help them understand their

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.960
 role and their position in the unit with mawr. Explanation. Um, yeah,

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.110
 there's a wide range of people that you're gonna experience, and

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.260
 you just have to modify your tone toe account for it.
