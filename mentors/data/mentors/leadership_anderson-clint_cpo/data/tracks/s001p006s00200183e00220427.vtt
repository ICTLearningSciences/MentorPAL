WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.380
my job has had a lot off ups and downs adventures. You can call them a

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.920
 lot of port calls. Those are the things that I remember most about

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.450
 to be in the Navy, but assed faras like usefulness. I can just think

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.990
 of one story on my last ship What I was doing an annual training was

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.520
 on the USS Blue Ridge. That's one of the main ships, one of the command

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.060
 and control ships that the Navy has and we're going through Answer.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.590
 Which is this very, very strenuous big test. Uh, that looks at

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.130
 all of the departments of the ship. Make sure that we're fit for seat.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.660
 Um, I was an electrician's that was called out there because there

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.200
 wasn't a chief in the unit. So, uh, electrical department had some

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.730
 problems that needed to be corrected while I was there. And so there

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.270
 was a big light that was shining on us. So it is our job toe, you

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.800
 know, like make sure that everybody was was doing the best job that

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.340
 they could. There's this one light pole that had some problems, and

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.870
 we have this first class that, um, like he put on his fall safety gear.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.410
 Me, too. We went up the ladder. It was really dangerous up there.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.940
 You know, like, you just take one move left and right, you know,

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.480
 or you don't put the hook on, and then your life's at risk. Um, he he

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.010
 was out there for hours, maybe four hours, five hours trying to troubleshoot.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.550
 Um, thats one, um, this run transistor that wasn't working.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.080
 Um, I went down, Um, maybe since someone else else up there. He

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.620
 stayed up there for hours and hours even longer. The whole day. It was

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.150
 nighttime by the time he got down, Um, that one problem that he fixed,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.690
 uh, it was like it was amazing. I tried to put him in for an award

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.220
 for it. Um, but that that's one job that I think, uh, really stands

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.760
 out in my mind from last year that I was really proud to be a part

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.290
 of and, yeah, it is great.
