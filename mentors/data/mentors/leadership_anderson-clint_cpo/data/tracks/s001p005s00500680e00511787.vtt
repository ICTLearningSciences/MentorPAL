00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.030
for me when I'm thinking about stories that I've had, That kind of says,

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.210
 Hey, you know what? I am in the Navy. Everyone knows I'm in the Navy.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.390
 I feel like I'm in the Navy. Um, they all have to deal with port

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.570
 calls. Uh, I remember being in Australia, and we we've first we pull

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.750
 in and I'm telling you, there was a line of people outside the gates

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.930
 and as soon as you walk, walk out, you know, like, uh maybe people

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.110
 start talking to you. You get to your first bar and, you know, you

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.290
 get these looks from people, you know, you get random people sit down

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.480
 beside you is like, Hey, ah, you want a beer? Let let me get this

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.660
 guy a beer. You know, like, what's life been like for you for the

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.840
 last couple of months? You get those stories all the time, Um, you goto

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.020
 gambling halls and you see, like people just like letting off steam,

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.200
 you know, drinking and talking and chatting. And, um, you know,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.380
 and and their many celebrities for a while, for at least you know,

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.560
 for days of their life they are the stars of the show, and I think that

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.740
 that really is the is the role that I see the Navy has played for

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.920
