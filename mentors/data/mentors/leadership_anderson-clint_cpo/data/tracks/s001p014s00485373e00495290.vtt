00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.790
The thing I'm most worried about as a Navy person is the continuation

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.740
 of my career. I'm of course, I would like to do the maximum time, which

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.680
 is 24 years for a chief. But to tell your truth, being in the reserves

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.630
 really aligns well with my civilian career. Especially because

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.570
 I'm considering having a federal job and I don't actually don't want

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.520
 to get out at 24 years. You're supposed Thio. Get out and you become

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.460
 a great soldier and you just, um you're allowed to go on based on

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.410
 the base and you're allowed to experience, like, veteran things all

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.350
 the way up until you retire. And that's when you start getting money.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.300
 But actually don't wanna really experience that so much. I wanna

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.240
 keep serving. And one way to do that is to be promoted to become a

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.190
 senior chief. So that could be something that I'm working on right now

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.130
 and also to be a nawf sir. And they haven't even longer career progression

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.080
 all the way up to 30 years. And that's something that I'm

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.020
 considered right now as well
