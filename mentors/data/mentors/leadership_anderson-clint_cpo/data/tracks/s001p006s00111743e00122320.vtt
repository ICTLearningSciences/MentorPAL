00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.720
Right now, I'm in a pretty intense program at the post graduate school

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.590
 studying cybersecurity. We take four classes and, um, I'm reading entire

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.460
 textbooks for each of my classes. It's ah, pretty, pretty intense

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.330
 from the time you wake up until about eight o'clock or so. Then

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.190
 I come home and I play video games and you know about some YouTube.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.060
 But before this, uh, when I wasn't in school, I was the senior enlisted

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.930
 adviser for the Navy Reserve back in Japan, and I was working a

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.800
 kind of a federal job. I was being achieved for one of the one of the

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.670
 ships out there, um, just overlooking what the contractors were doing.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.540
 But that actually gave me a lot of time. And during that free time

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.410
 actually spent a lot of time working for the Navy Reserve, which

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.280
 is also looked at about 50 other sailors from the top to the bottom

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.140
 of Japan. Um, they all have their own lives, and I have to keep all

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.010
 of them on track about what they're doing for the nature reserve, whether

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.880
 they're going on their eighties, whether they're conducting a

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.750
 lot of their training. So I had two jobs in one a time, so that was

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.620
 also a pretty intense work as well
