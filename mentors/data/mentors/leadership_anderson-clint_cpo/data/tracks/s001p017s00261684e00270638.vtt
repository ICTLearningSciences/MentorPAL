00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.980
a good way to deal with grief is to really focus on some of the positive

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.110
 things that are happening in your life. If you have family, if you

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.240
 have kids, uh, if you have a good network of friends, then those are

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.360
 the main ones that you can go to to kind of get your mind focused

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.490
 on. You know, some of the positive things instead of the thing that's

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.620
 really cousins use, um, problems. Um, of course, you know, their

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.750
 their individual moments. You know, you're thinking alone at night you're

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.880
 driving home, Um, when there's no one around and you can't really,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.010
 like, distract reminding that way. Um, in that case, you know,

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.130
 it's Ah, yeah, just stay positive. And during those times as well, maybe,

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.260
 uh, cost someone on the phone. Um, yeah, do some kind of sport

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.390
 that works out really, really well as well
