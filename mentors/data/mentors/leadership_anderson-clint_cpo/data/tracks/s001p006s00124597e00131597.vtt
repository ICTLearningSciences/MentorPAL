00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.600
here at the post graduate school. We have four classes and each class

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.350
 last about an hour or two between each class. There's, you know, like

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.100
 a little brick. So, um, for the most part, for the for up until noon,

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.850
 you just sit there and listen and you absorb the material after

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.600
 that, then you're pretty much free. But there's no way that you can

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.350
 skip a day without, like studying something, so you take one or maybe

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.100
 two classes, and you really focus on them. You read a chapter or two

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.850
 or you do some homework.
