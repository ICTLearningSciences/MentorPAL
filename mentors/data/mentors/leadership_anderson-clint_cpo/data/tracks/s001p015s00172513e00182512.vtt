00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.130
I would say not just for junior officers, but for everyone even enlisted.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.420
 You have to know, um, how much you can afford you Have you have

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.700
 your cash? Um, laid out annually. You set some kind of budget, decide

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.990
 if I'm making 60,000. Just live off of 50,000 and then split that

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.270
 up by months. And then that's the life that you can afford. So budgeting

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.560
 is really, really useful. I personally didn't need a budget, because

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.840
 I, um I lived as cheap as possible. And I just knew, You know,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.130
 like, I have a $5000 check coming in every month and I live off of

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.410
 1000 maybe $2000 per month then, um, yeah, all the rest of this goes

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.700
 and savings, but I know a lot of people aren't aren't like that. Some

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.980
 people have family that they have to like, they'd be out money to.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.270
 Um, yeah, some people have espouses that really are very materialistic.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.550
 And, yeah, like, debt is a really big problem in the military.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.840
 So, um, a song. You keep a budget, you should be fine.
