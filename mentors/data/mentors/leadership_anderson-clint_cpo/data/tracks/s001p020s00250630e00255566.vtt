00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.960
personally, I've never dealt with a formal right up for a suicide attempt.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.080
 But I would imagine that if anything happens physically thing,

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.190
 we should, uh, write it up. So, for instance, if the person hurts themselves

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.300
 if they heard another person, um, if they're very, very violent,

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.420
 if they say, um yeah, particularly terrible things, For instance,

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.530
 um, you know I want to hurt myself. Uh, then you at least want to

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.640
 document it so that where that you or whether somebody that comes

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.760
 after you, who's who's not familiar with the situation, there's at least

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.870
 a track s so that we can either look at the past history and make

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.980
 a determination on what we should do with the person or someone who's

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.100
 not. You can actually look at the past and have a good idea about

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.210
 what they should do with that person.
