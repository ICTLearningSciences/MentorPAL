00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.290
When I first heard about 9 11, I was at prototype. It's the school that

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.740
 trains you to work on a nuclear reactor up in upstate New York. I

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.180
 was walking down my room and my roommate, um, said, Hey, Clinton, take

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.630
 a look at the TV and I looked at the screen. I saw E. Guess there

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.070
 was smoke coming from the first tower. Um, at first I didn't think

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.520
 too much about it, just like everyone else. They said, Oh, it's maybe

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.960
 some smoke or someone said it was a plane. Um, things like that happened,

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.410
 Um, not too common, but it happens enough in American. That's

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.850
 not be surprised. Uh, it was pretty shocking once the second plane

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.300
 hit. Um, after that happened, I after, you know, being glued to the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.740
 TV for about an hour. You know, they called us all back in, um to school,

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.190
 you know, we got there, you know, we kind of just chatted. No

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.630
 one really knew what was going on. And then after about an hour or

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.080
 two, then they sent us back. I heard that other, um, other military

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.520
 establishments all had to, like, stay where they were. You know, like

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.960
 preparing for war something. But because I was at school, you know

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.410
 that there wasn't really a big need for us to be there. But things

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.850
 changed after that. Before I had things changed my psyche because of

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.300
 that. Up until that time, I thought, Well, the navy is this place where

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.740
 they give you a decent amount of cash. They prepare you for a job,

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.190
 you know, doing some complex with some complex operation. We exercise

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.630
 a little bit, you know, we study a lot, Um, and we get free meals

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.080
 after that. Then I realized you know what? We are Americans. Police.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.520
 Uh, we are the world's police. We actually have to do something

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.970
 to stop this. We have toe have to make sure that planes don't hit any

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.410
 of my companions again. Any of my my fellow Americans again. So it

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.860
 got riel. Uh, that's a long way of saying that you know what I start

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.300
 toe understand my position in the world after 9 11
