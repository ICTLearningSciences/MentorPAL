00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.180
one of the very first things I try to do is, um, get enough information

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.510
 so that I don't change the the basis of the report. Um, I would like

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.850
 to know if they would like to report it. That's one of the main ones

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.180
 I would like to know if they need medical help or assistance. That's

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.510
 another one. Um, I'd like to know if they if they are just doing

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.840
 fine in general. You know, I don't want, uh, like, send them off in

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.180
 the world, um, crying or, you know, possibly even suicidal without

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.510
 getting some kind of like a connection. Because if they came to me,

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.840
 then obviously they want to talk to me. Maybe they think, um, my words

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.170
 can kind of see them Or that I can direct them to the right location.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.500
 And I'll I don't wanna send them off without understanding enough

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.840
 about the situation so that I'm doing it correctly. So the things

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.170
 I do get to know them, see if they wanna follow criminal report and

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.500
 see if they need medical assistance
