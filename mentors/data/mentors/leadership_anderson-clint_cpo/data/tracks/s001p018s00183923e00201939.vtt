00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.700
if you feel that someone is being harassed, obviously has passed the friendly

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.550
 point. Um, and you think that's going a little bit too far?

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.410
 You have several different, um, methods that you can you can resolve

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.260
 to to get it, um, get you taken care of. One way is direct. You know,

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.110
 you just go over to the person you say, Hey, um, I know. So what's

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.960
 going on? Maybe you should chill out, whoever it is, And, uh, and

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.820
 that that might work another way. It could be indirect, Which means

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.670
 that you might not know the two people, you know, they could be strangers,

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.520
 but you might notice that their friend had been hanging out with

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.370
 them. You can kind of talk with him and say, Hey, you know what?

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.230
 Like I noticed this going on because you kind of go over there and

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.080
 make sure everything's mellow. Another alternative is, uh, you can use

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.930
 the protocol, which is you go to their, uh whatever. Supervisory,

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.780
 um, person is there, So if it's on the ship, it could be an MP military

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.630
 police. If it's out in the club, you could go to the bartender.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.490
 Maybe there's a manager. Maybe there's a bartender. Maybe there's a

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.340
 local police officer, you know? Um, yeah, You have some authority authoritarian

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.190
 figures that you can go to to kind of like Mel out. The

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.040
 situation on there's also like if none of those work, um, or if you

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.900
 want tohave a little bit more casual, um, way toe talk, these people

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.750
 you can do, um, distraction. That's when, like, you see, you see the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.600
 two people having some kind of interaction and you say, Hey, you

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.450
 know what? Like let's go play pool or Lett's Let's have this conversation

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.310
 over here. Let's go dancing. Um, you don't mention the topic directly,

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.160
 but you do change the topic based on something that you think

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.010
 might be a little bit more friendly to them.
