 um, environment, in which case, like, I have so many like, um,

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.600
 mentors and teachers that I could go to, especially when I am having

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.180
 difficulty difficulties with my studies, Um, and then my personal

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.760
 life. I have my roommate upstairs. He's really great, you know, his

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.350
