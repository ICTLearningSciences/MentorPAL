00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.020
the most common mistake that I see new leaders make deals with them, providing

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.200
 information that they're not sure of themselves. As a chief,

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.370
 you always have toe think Well, you know what? I have the answers.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.550
 I know the answers. And that's not 100% accurate. Yes, I am the person

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.720
 with the answers. But the more important question is where I get

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.900
 those answers from the reason that I have all the answers is because

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.070
 I have ah crew of people behind me that can back me up that have the

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.250
 answers throughout all of the people. And, um what first classes?

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.420
 The problem that I've seen in upcoming 1st and 2nd class is is thinking

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.600
 that they are the ones that that the information comes from themselves.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.770
 And in that case you probably get some wrong answers. Um, depending

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.950
 on what they're saying. So, for instance, um, you're talking

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.120
 about an award. Oh, well, this award needs needs this and that. And

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.300
 you don't you don't need it. You don't need that block filled out.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.470
 Well, some of those things could be wrong, but because they're under

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.650
 such stress toe actually provide an answer. They provide some answer

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.820
 the difference between new answers and, for instance, Chiefs. The

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.000
 chief will say, You're supposed to felt this block this block. It's

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.170
 supposed to be filled out like this. This block. Hold on, I'll get

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.350
 back to you And that's the difference between a strong and a week later.
