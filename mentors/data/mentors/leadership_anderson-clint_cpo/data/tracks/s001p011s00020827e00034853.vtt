00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.710
one thing I do really well as a leader is I listen, and I'm not quick

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.560
 to excitement. I remember there was one time that my commanding officer,

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.420
 my officer in charge, was really chewing me out, you know? And

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.270
 there was another person, um, in other room who is listening on. And

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.130
 I guess I I think I let everybody leave, you know, um, and we still

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.990
 needed toe, have some things done. And I let him, you know, like, have

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.840
 his have his words with me, Um, and toward the end, because I just

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.700
 sat there, you know, with my hands behind my back. Yes, sir. No,

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.560
 sir. And very, very careful with my words. Um, so I see kind of realized

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.410
 like, yeah, maybe he's kind of pushing me, and I'm here to help

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.270
 him rather than hurt him. So the end of our conversation was Yes. I'll

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.120
 get right on that, sir. And then I finished it. And that person,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.980
 he was a first class at the time, you know, he tapped me on the shoulder

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.840
 and said, Boy, you know, I've never seen something like that.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.690
 And the way that you handled yourself was so impressive. I don't know.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.550
 I could have done that. You know, I think most people that were in

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.400
 that position would have been very defensive and started, you know,

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.260
 going back and forth. Maybe he had an argument, would have had an

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.120
 argument. But that's not what I do. That's not how I roll. So I think

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.970
 once the commanding officer, you know, once he got his frustration

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.830
 with the unit out of the way, he said, You know what? This person can

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.690
 actually help me, um, put him on my team rather than attack him,

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.540
 and we actually got the work done. So that first class actually became

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.400
 a chief. And I'm hoping that, um, that that model that I gave him

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.250
 will direct him and with his future, his future interactions with his

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.110
 leadership as well.
