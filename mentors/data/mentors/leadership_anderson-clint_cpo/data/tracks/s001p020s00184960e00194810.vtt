00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.730
leaders have a really fine line to walk. Um, between keeping separate

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.600
 from their sailors and their personal lives and making sure they're

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.470
 safe. Now, if you're in a situation, um, where one of your sailors has

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.350
 access to guns has have has access to violent things, Then you want

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.230
 to make sure that they don't leave your work area. Uh, with those

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.100
 intentions with those thoughts without speaking to an expert first,

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.970
 um, the chaplain is a really great person to talk to. Other supervisors

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.850
 are as well, if you're still scared that they might go home, um,

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.730
 and still might cause themselves violence. Um, in this case, I would

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.600
 just bring it up. I would, I would. I just wouldn't keep it to myself.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.470
 I bring it up toe the command master chief, or even the commanding

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.350
 officer. If if I felt it was necessary
