You should never try to push anybody to do something they don't want to

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.610
 do. Um, if someone's talking about suicidal thoughts, but they haven't

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.490
 mentioned that they do want to commit suicide, then of course,

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.370
 you should listen to yourself. If if it got to you in the first place,

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.250
 then obviously they must trust you enough for them to share their

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.130
 thoughts. Um, in some cases, it might be a little bit, um, more than

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.010
 just just talk and you don't feel comfortable with them leaving. They

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.890
 didn't say that they want to commit suicide, but you could tell

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.770
 that, um who knows what could happen tonight? Maybe they might speak

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.650
 with an ex girlfriend. Maybe they might have an argument with your

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.530
 wife. Um, maybe it's getting later. And you think they might go drinking?

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.410
 Uh, and you don't want to risk it. So in that case, um, one suggestion

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.280
 will be toe kind of guide them Thio victims victims advocate.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.160
 Even though they didn't mention, um, suicide. You might just wanna

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.040
 mention that to them so that they could just at least chat it out.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.920
 You might want to talk to the chaplain. Um, just say Hey, you know

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.800
