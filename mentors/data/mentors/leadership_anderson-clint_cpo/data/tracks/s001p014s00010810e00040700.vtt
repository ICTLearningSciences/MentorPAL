WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.920
some of the main challenges that I faced when I started, uh, going through

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.980
 my educational career was, um I mean, I I didn't have the most

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.050
 money. My mother wasn't working to regularly. My my sister was on welfare

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.110
 and she had three kids of her own. And, um, yeah, I didn't have

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.180
 all the basic necessities. It didn't really bother me too much because,

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.250
 like, I didn't feel like I needed, um, many things, But yeah,

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.310
 we didn't have a car most of the time riding around on the bus on many

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.380
 occasions, didn't have enough money for, um, for paying for things

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.440
 that school food was basically free. You know, I don't think that

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.510
 I ever wanted for food. I just didn't eat that much. So I wasn't that

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.580
 hungry. School was in the morning, and at night time we had enough,

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.640
 um, food on the table, so that wasn't a big problem. But it's more

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.710
 for things that make you a better person through life, For instance,

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.770
 like having enough money toe go to the theater or having some cash

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.840
 for your local comic book. You know, I didn't have those those type

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.900
 of things. Um, Christmas time was, uh, they give you some gloves, and

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.970
 that was among some other things. You know, they they tried and not

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.040
 gonna complain. You know, I had a good life. I had a loving family,

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.100
 so I'm not gonna push that too hard. But your basic material things

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.170
 was something that I think would have given me a bit a better or

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.230
 a different perspective. Uh, coming up through the, uh, through the

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.300
 years, I was young, um, and obviously, like, growing up like this By

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.370
 the time I let's say, got to the navy, I don't think that I had a very

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.430
 strong work ethic. I did come and I did learn I was in the nuclear

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.500
 propulsion field and I think someone who had a different lifestyle,

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.560
 for instance, you know, they had their standard 1300 s a t know that

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.630
 their tutors coming coming through it. Not all of them were like

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.700
 that, but just a few. I think that they probably had, ah, better a

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.760
 better quality of education while they were through the program. Whereas

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.830
 for me, you know, I Yeah, sure. I read the book sometimes, and

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.890
 I tried to understand as much as I could, but I didn't have the basic

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.960
 electron ICS to give me that preparation. You know, I didn't know

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.030
 what a ground was. I I barely knew what current was like. I had to understand

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.090
 everything from the very, very beginning. When I think some

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.160
 of those things I should have gotten through public education through

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.220
 the books, I would have read if I would have been a good student

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.290
 or through the training, I would have gotten, you know, had I been

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.350
 a better student in school. Um, so the good thing about the Navy is

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.420
 they do start you off on on an even playing field like you. We expect

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.490
 that you know nothing. They expected people like me, which was which

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.550
 was excellent. So I'm just saying I didn't become the superstar right

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.620
 out the gate actually had toe put in. I think all the effort that

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.680
 I should have in high school in, um in school and, you know, I took

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.750
 the challenge and that was successful.
