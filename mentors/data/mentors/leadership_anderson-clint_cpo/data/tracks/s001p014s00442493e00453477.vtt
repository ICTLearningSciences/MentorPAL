00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.340
boring work can exist all over the place, but you just have to make sure

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.830
 that you keep it light. Um, there's some kind of levity that you

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.330
 can have toe that that you conclude include to every job. And it makes

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.820
 the time go by a lot faster. Um, there's a time that, like, let's

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.310
 have a control point watch, which is when you're down in the bottom

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.800
 of the plant you have toe, make sure that everybody that goes into

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.290
 the reactor room is properly frisk, which means that they have Ah, you

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.790
 have a wand. And you, um, go up and down their body and make sure

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.280
 that, you know, like they go in without any, uh, zoom is on them and

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.770
 they come out without any zoom is on them. And to make sure that that

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.260
 they didn't pick something up on the inside, Um, it could be maybe

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.750
 two hours or three hours that nobody comes in. Maybe you could spend

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.250
 a whole six hour watch and you don't see anyone. Maybe they're coming

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.740
 in back and forth. So, uh, in moments like those when you're all

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.230
 alone, uh, it could be good toe. You know, have a book that you're

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.720
 kind of reading, Obviously, Like, uh, a technical book. Um, when people

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.210
 come back, back and forth, you kind of joke with them like, Hey,

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.710
 what's going on up there on the top side? And, you know, like, uh,

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.200
 you kind of play with them a little bit, and that makes the time go

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.690
 by a little bit faster.
