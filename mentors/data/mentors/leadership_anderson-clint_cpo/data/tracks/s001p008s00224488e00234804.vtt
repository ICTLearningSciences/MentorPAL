00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.800
If you're headed out there, especially overseas, then you need to get

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.740
 all of your household shipping goods in order. Uh, their websites and

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.690
 places to go for that. The sooner you get it out there, the better.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.640
 Because I know that people who wait, uh, they get over there and then

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.590
 all of a sudden there, there without fridges and microwaves and

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.530
 the basic necessities and that that, you know, a few weeks is pretty

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.480
 trying for them. You also want to get your support network. They're

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.430
 a swell once you get to your new command and you don't know anyone,

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.380
 uh, it's ah, kind of a long battle because by the time you you find

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.320
 the person that you're supposed to be around, uh, they could say, Okay,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.270
 well, uh, you need to do this next thing, and that next thing is

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.220
 gonna take another week. And, uh, if anything goes wrong with that

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.170
 paperwork, you could be sitting there, you know, like like a month

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.110
 without the thing that you really, really need. Uh, that could be your

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.060
 uniforms or your clothes or your kitchen utensils or your car, Um,

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.010
 a myriad of items. So just the sooner you start, the better
