00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.020
I won't lie. Fatigue really gets to There is sometimes that I was on deployment.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.180
 And I'm telling you, every four days you were up 24 hours.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.350
 That is You wake up, um, seven o'clock, one day you have your normal

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.510
 work day. You go ate lunch, then you come back after that, you know,

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.680
 one hour, and then you you have a five hour watch. All of a sudden,

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.840
 you realize that it's eight o'clock, and then you have your general

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.010
 quarters and that last and especially like the longer ones, you

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.170
 know, like it could be close to midnight. Um, and then you have toe,

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.340
 actually, uh, do some kind of preventive maintenance. Or there's something

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.500
 that that happens all the way up until the next work day. And

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.670
 then you have your normal work day and yeah, every every four days.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.830
 It tended to be, um, a really long day, and it wears on you. How do

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.000
 you deal with those things? Well, it helps to be young. That that's

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.160
 that's for sure. I I think that I could still do it now and maybe

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.330
 with a bigger smile on my face. But back in the time. I think that my

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.490
 energy really helped me. The fact that I was in pretty good shape

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.660
 the fact that you know, like, yeah, you're kind of sleepy. But, you

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.820
 know, you drink some coffee and you wake up the fact that I was, like,

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.990
 a pretty healthy from my from the top of my head to the bottom of

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.150
 my feet. So to make sure that I'm in that type of shape, you have to

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.320
