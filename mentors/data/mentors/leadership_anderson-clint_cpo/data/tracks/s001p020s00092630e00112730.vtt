00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.170
when someone has, uh, something that causes great grief in their life,

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.490
 you must realize that they're not performing at their at the capable

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.810
 at the capability that they should be. So you have to take that into

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.140
 account. And, um, you have ah few tools at your disposal. Uh, number

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.460
 one is kind of ignoring the problem, right? And that's probably

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.780
 one of the worst things that you can do. But, um uh, if you try to distract

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.100
 them from the problem, then it works. For some people, um, it

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.420
 depends on what it is they're grieving over eso. If you keep their

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.740
 mind on their work without delving too much on what it is that they're

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.060
 grieving about, that could help. Um, what's ah, better tactic is

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.390
 to get it out in the open and see if they need to be taking off the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.710
 ship or assigned to a different job. That, like, let's say, this job

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.030
 is kind of dangerous. If they keep performing it, um, you could send

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.350
 them toe something that's like, let's say, going to the library and

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.670
 helping people there. There they have a little bit more timeto think

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.990
 about, um, the thing that's causing them trouble without putting

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.310
 other people's lives in jeopardy. Um, uh, one of the last result resource

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.640
 is, is toe. Get them off the ship. Um, if for some reason like

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.960
 just being on the ship is something that they can't really um, perform

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.280
 effectively at, then maybe they should get off the ship. Either

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.600
 you give them some vacation time, and you just let them, um, grieve

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.920
 with whatever resource is they need, Uh, maybe with family, maybe with

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.240
 the psychologist, Uh, maybe with their personal chaplain, Um, you

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.560
 can send them there, or you can, um, send them to a specific place.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.890
 Like, for instance, um, there are several places on the base that

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.210
 they could go to, um, if they need help. Especially like, let's say,

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.530
 there have a drinking problem. Um, there's places for that that they

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.850
 can get that help
