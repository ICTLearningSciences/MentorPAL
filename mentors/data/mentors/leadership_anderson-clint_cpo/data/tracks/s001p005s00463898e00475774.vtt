00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.480
generally, What I found is that it's so much more easy. Thio Thio. Have

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.120
 military members do the things that you want than civilians? I think

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.750
 that there's a long there's there a lot of reasons for this number

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.380
 one because you're directly in charge off the military persons progression.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.010
 Um, maybe you're not directly in charge, but you can control

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.650
 it. All you have to do is just tell is Chief. That's kind of like

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.280
 telling the mom or the dad of some kid versus a civilian, and that's

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.910
 more like dealing with a stranger. Number one. You have no idea who

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.550
 is boss is. If you do, maybe they're kind of separated. Uh, even if

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.180
 you did know him like because they're under government obligations,

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.810
 um, they can't really chastised the person under them the same way

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.450
 that a person in the military could. So it z not night and day, but

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.080
 because you're more involved in the leadership structure of the military

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.710
 person and you can affect them. Ah, lot more. They tend to listen

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.340
 more, and they tend to be more. We're willing to fight for one team

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.980
 rather than, uh at the job site just because it's a part of their

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.610
 their their job
