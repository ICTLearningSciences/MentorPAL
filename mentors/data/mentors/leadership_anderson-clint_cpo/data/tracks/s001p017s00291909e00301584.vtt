00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.220
when there's someone who's sick chronically and frequently, uh, to tell

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.580
 you the truth, then maybe just handles that we don't treat them differently

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.950
 than any other person. Um, you can have a sprained ankle,

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.310
 and it could last for, like, three or four months. Um, ifit's something

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.680
 that commanding officer can't deal with or the your division officer

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.040
 can't deal with. Then they get sent off the ship. However, if they

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.410
 are on the ship Assuming that, you know, all these cases are on

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.770
 the ship. Then, um, you just let them live in their light, limited duty,

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.140
 um, world. And once they come back, then you treat them as normal.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.500
 If they're on light, limited duty, you don't mark them down at all.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.870
 You whatever job they have, whether it's in a limited role, you

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.230
 just grate them accordingly. We don't discriminate here based on disability.
