00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.340
sexual assault is really different than other bad behaviors in the fact

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.820
 that you can actually, like, lose valuable team members based on it.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.310
 Um, number one sexual assault generally doesn't have, um, specifically

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.800
 to do with work. Of course, they can occur, um, during the work

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.280
 environment, and that creates bad moral, um, bad morale within the

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.770
 unit. However, um, whether I can, you know, check a pump, you know,

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.260
 for for the correct voltage or not, has nothing to do with, um, me

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.740
 trying to get a date with you later on. So So there's a very, very strong

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.230
 line between work and, um dating, but they mix when you involve

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.720
 sexual assault and sexual harassment. Um, specifically, I remember

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.200
 we had a master chief, and he was one of the good master chiefs that

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.690
 I've had. Um, he was very direct. He's very stern. He got everybody

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.180
 to do the work the right way and efficiently. Um, however, he had,

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.660
 um, some communication with, uh, someone someone in our unit. Eventually.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.150
 Hey. Got kicked out of the off the ship, and, um, he eventually

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.640
 became a senior chief, and we saw him walking around his career.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.120
 You know, like it's probably gonna end pretty soon after that ast faras

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.610
 the grill like she stayed on, but she had a badge, and yeah, everyone

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.100
 knew what happened between them. Um, she got to stay on because,

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.580
 like, she's lower. Um, she had a lower responsibility in that, um

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.070
 the higher you go, the more supervisor you are, the more you're gonna

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.560
 be hammered down on, you know, And a zoo was hit, as was her case.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.040
 I'm not sure that she had a, um her rank removed, but yeah, yeah,

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.530
 that that's, ah, fragmentation in in that case, And it really affects

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.020
 the unit to have someone who's really good at their job being removed

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.500
 and having someone who stays in the unit have that cast that shadow

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.990
 above her for the rest of time that she's there. So sexual assault,

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.480
 sexual harassment, fraternization, all the sexual things that don't

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.960
 really deal with your job. You kinda want to stay away from, um,

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.450
 leave playtime and playtime and and work at work.
