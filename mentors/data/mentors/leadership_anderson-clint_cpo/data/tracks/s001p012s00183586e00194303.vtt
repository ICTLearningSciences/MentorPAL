00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.800
For the most part, we pay our general state and federal taxes just like

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.750
 everyone else. Um, for the time I joined, I just, like, sign some

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.700
 sheet of paper and didn't worry about it again. But other people are,

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.650
 ah, lot slicker than me, and this is what I mean. You always keep

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.610
 your home of record. My home of record is California, which means that

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.560
 I'll be a California resident no matter where I am. But for instance,

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.510
 when I was in Washington, Washington doesn't require state taxes,

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.460
 so there's a way that you can still be a California resident. But

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.410
 you signed the paperwork so that your ah, Washington resident, which

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.360
 means that you don't have to pay state taxes and California is your

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.310
 home of record. So you still get the benefits of still being associated

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.260
 with California. You could go to the all the universities, uh,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.220
 that you want to You could get, uh, you could go to State college and

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.170
 still have all all that access. However, for tax filing purposes,

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.120
 uh, your your tax free I think Florida is like that as well. So, um,

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.070
 you just have to look at what your state, um, how you state covers

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.020
 active duty personnel and then take advantage of it that way.
