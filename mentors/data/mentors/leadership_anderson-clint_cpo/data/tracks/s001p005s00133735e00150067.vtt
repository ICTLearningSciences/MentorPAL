00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.820
the best way that you could help prepare for our mission, especially a

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.790
 strenuous mission, is to give them knowledge about what's to come.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.750
 I recently just got off this in serve tour on the USS Blue Ridge. And

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.720
 as far as the team was concerned, there's thousands and thousands

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.690
 of jobs to be completed. Their tons and tons of work hours to be had,

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.660
 Um when I when I got there, I think they were waking up in the morning

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.620
 and then they wouldn't get to bed until, like, 10 or 11 o'clock

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.590
 at night when I would get when I would, uh, finally tell him to break

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.560
 off for the night. And I think one of the issues was they didn't

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.530
 know how long it would last. Is this gonna be how all of deployment

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.490
 is gonna be? Is it? Are we gonna ever let up this weekend next month?

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.460
 When does it stop? If you had a plan about what things they're supposed

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.430
 to be completed and the amount of time they're supposed to take

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.400
 and you divided up in the equal portions and they could actually see

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.360
 what they're working on. Then they come in with a sense of saying,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.330
 Hey, you know what? I'm gonna do this thing. And the longer I work,

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.300
 the closer I get to that goal. And with that in mind, then I think

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.270
 that will give them a better understanding about what they're supposed

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.230
 to do with their job. Without that information. Um, you kind of

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.200
 get depressed. You kind of get like down about how much work there is

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.170
 to be had.
