00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.190
in the Navy, we tend to have three distinct groupings of sexual assault.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.530
 Sexual harassment, Um, for the green light that tend, those tend

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.870
 to be like a words that you can say to another person. Um, hey, sexy.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.210
 Hey, sweetie. Things that are a little bit above friendliness, um,

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.550
 that the other person might feel uncomfortable with, or maybe even

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.890
 another person a third person might feel uncomfortable with those could

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.230
 be green light. That's when a supervisor goes to the, um to the

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.570
 parties and kind of squashes it either the offending party and say,

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.910
 Hey, you know what? You shouldn't say those words. Or you could go to

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.250
 the person who was spoken to and say, Hey, um, this'd what I noticed.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.590
 Um, are are you comfortable with that? And kind of, uh, like, ease

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.930
 the situation there just through words. Yellow light can be a little

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.270
 bit more, um, more intense. That could be slight touching, maybe

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.610
 grabbing the shoulders and and rubbing or, um, patting people on the

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.950
 but especially between, like after sporting events, you know those

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.280
 type of Pat's, um, when there is touching involved, you have to make

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.620
 sure that like the person who was touched doesn't feel that that action

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.960
 was sexual. However, it can be classified sexual, um, based on

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.300
 another person's viewpoint or even if you noticed it yourself. You

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.640
 know, like if you were offended by it, or you have some questions concerning

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.980
 it thin that could be yellow, regardless of whether either

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.320
 of the two parties thought it was sexual or not. Um, but yeah, touching

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.660
 and especially words like, you know, like more serious words Like,

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.000
 uh, I want to do this to the to you Or I think, uh, you know, we

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.340
 should go to this place, you know, like it's a It could be pretty pretty

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.680
 bad. That's in that sense. Red light is definite touching. Um,

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.020
 maybe on private sections, um, lower lower extremities, uh, maybe grabbing

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.360
 long grabs, maybe constant stairs, a certain a certain place,

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.700
 which obviously has sexual overtones on those for those cases. You

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.040
 definitely have to bring those up to a supervisor and get it documented.
