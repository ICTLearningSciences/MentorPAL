00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.910
the best budget that you can have is, ah, one that you start off with

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.970
 some of the basic materials. Well, everyone needs off cell phone, gas

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.040
 insurance, um, decent amount of food. Once you have that, then you

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.100
 slowly start to build up the rest of it until you get Thio the salary

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.160
 that you're looking for. The salary that that you're looking for

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.220
 is about, um, 70 to 80% off of your your monthly salary. That's the

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.280
 kind of, uh, version that I took on. You don't wanna be hitting your,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.350
 you know, like, if you make 5000 don't wanna be, uh, be hitting 5000

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.410
 every single month. So there's some kind of buffer is gonna change

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.470
 based on who you are and what kind of goals you're looking for. Maybe

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.530
 you're trying to buy a house. Then you should have a bigger buffer.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.590
 Maybe you're just trying to buy another car. Smaller buffer. Maybe

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.650
 you said, hey, you know what? Like I'm not gonna retire or, uh, save

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.720
 for another couple of years. Then you know, you know, have at it.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.780
 But once once you have that goal, uh, then you make the rest of your

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.840
 buffer based on your excess and your basic necessities
