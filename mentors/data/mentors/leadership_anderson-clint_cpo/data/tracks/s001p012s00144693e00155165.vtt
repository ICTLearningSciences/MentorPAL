if you tend to not be able to drink when you're when you're out in the

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.460
 water. But, of course, when you pull in Yeah, that's the first thing

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.270
 that people, uh, people do is they go to straight to the bars. You're

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.080
 not supposed to bring the beer back, but you are allowed to drink

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.890
 on the many establishments outside. Uh, if you are in the middle of

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.690
 the water, then we have these things called still still beaches, which,

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.500
 for instance, like Fourth of July, The commanding officer might,

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.310
 um, say, hey, you know what? Like we're not working today, Um, since

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.110
 everybody up to the to the hangar bay or to the to the flight deck

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.920
 and you get two beers, they give you, like these ribbons. Um, and

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.730
 those two beers, like you can either drink. I know you're not supposed

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.530
 to, but some people, like, give ribbons to other people. They catch

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.340
 you doing that, then? Yeah, you'll be reprimanded, but yeah, two

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.150
 beers for that day, and then they don't want to see alcohol again.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.960
 Um, you know, the next day or the day before, So the still beaches happened.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.760
 Like I said, during holidays or after you've gotten done with

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.570
