00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.140
As I progressed through my career, I found that I work slightly more and

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.440
 more. So I began probably with around like, nine or 10 hour workdays,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.730
 and they every about every five years, it grows about one one more

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.020
 hour with each solid workday. So, for instance, now, um, for a normal

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.310
 workday, I could work, like maybe 12 or 13 hours. Whereas when

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.610
 I started, it was like, nine. But, um, what's more important is the

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.900
 type of work that you do. So when you first come in, um, you just told

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.190
 what to do is like, Hey, you know what? Like we have toe get this

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.480
 pump changed out, Um, get the grapples and, you know, take it out.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.780
 Um, five years later, you're a part of the cruise like, Hey, you take

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.070
 those four people for people and you go and take that pump out five

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.360
 years after that, Uh, then you're the person that tells that one

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.660
 person to go do it, and you're actually not at the scene. Sometimes

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.950
 you're not at the scene on Ben. They just tell you Hey, we just did

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.240
 it. Um, you still have the same amount of work because there's a lot

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.530
 of paperwork that goes along with it. But you can see that as you as

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.830
 you progress. It goes from working with your hands toe, working with

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.120
 your mind on working with the pin.
