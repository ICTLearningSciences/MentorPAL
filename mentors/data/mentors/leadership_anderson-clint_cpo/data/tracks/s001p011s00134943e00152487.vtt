secret sauce tips for your leadership style number one. It's always good

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.490
 to make them laugh if you're up there, you know, presenting to the

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.300
 unit and you can make people start banging on the desk and laughing

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.120
 and stuff, you know? Then then your winner in their eyes. You know,

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.940
 that gives you a little bit of space to make some mistakes and have

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.760
 them say I you know, it's fine. Um, if you are so strict all the time,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.570
 then you know you don't build that communion that's necessary,

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.390
 toe. Have a good relationship. Also, put your experience in there so

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.210
 there's gonna be, let's say, for instance, so many trainings that you're

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.030
 gonna be doing. And it's gonna say, Well, um, drunk driving and

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.840
 the power plant slide is gonna be there, and you're gonna have people

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.660
 like looking off into the into the wild. But as a chief every now

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.480
 and then, you know, you assert your authority by, um, you know, you

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.300
 know, interrupting the first class is giving the training and saying,

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.110
 Hey, you know what, Um, unit. In my experience, I had this experience,

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.930
 um, one of my friends he got busted for drunk driving. He was

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.750
 fined $10,000 and he got busted down one. And he was a good friend

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.570
 of mine. And this is what happened to him, X, y and Z, you know, So

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.380
 if you would have done this, it would have been better. Continue with

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.200
 your story. If you put little spices like that little pieces like

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.020
 that in whatever you're doing, being counseling, be it training, be

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.840
 it even just jogging. You know, you just mentioned something that's

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.650
 happening or you have your own, like little flavor off a ditty that

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.470
 you can do. Then everyone's gonna respect you a little bit more, I think.
