00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.630
when you're going to a new location, you should have received several

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.410
 items from the command. For instance, you might get an email from the

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.190
 command master Chief. Uh, it might have a welcome aboard package,

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.970
 which goes through a list of items that are really useful. Tow newcomers.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.750
 You can also go to websites. Um, that, for instance, my navy portal

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.530
 or whatever the current website is, that gives you a list of documents

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.310
 that you need to fill out. And some, um, some pretty good advice.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.090
 Your ship or your command might also have a household goods item

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.870
 shipping office that can explain how much things would cost and

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.650
 the range of times that you can expect your goods to be there. Um, once

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.430
 you go to your new location
