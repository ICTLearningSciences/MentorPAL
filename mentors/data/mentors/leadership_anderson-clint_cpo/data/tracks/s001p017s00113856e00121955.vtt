The main training that we get when you have somebody who's thinking about

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.050
 suicide is to not keep it to yourself. Uh, you go to the victim's

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.140
 advocate and you let them handle it. Um, the first thing that you

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.240
 want to do is number one. Um, listen to them. Let them chat with you.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.340
 The next thing that should be on your mind is to not leave them by

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.440
 themselves, where they're gonna be sent. They should be with someone,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.540
 be it you or someone that you send with them. Um, and the third thing

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.630
 is, um, after they're in good hands is to follow up with them,

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.730
 Let them know that you know you as a supervisor and you as a ship, you

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.830
 care about them and their well being.
