00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.940
the coolest thing I ever did while I was in the Navy was when I went skydiving

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.040
 with more than one of my buddies. Um, on some random weekend

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.130
 is like 100 bucks or something. But that has nothing to do with Navy.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.220
 That that's, uh, when I had some free time. But while I was working

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.320
 for the Navy is probably when I first got to my aircraft care and

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.410
 I went up to the flight deck, you know, put your ear plugs in and

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.500
 saw all of the planes start to come in. That's when you know, like you

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.600
 smell the greenness saltiness of the of the ocean. You see the planes

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.690
 coming in, Uh, you see, like all the people in their in their skittle

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.780
 outfits, you know, sending them off and bringing them in to see

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.880
 the catapults Um, fly off the f fourteens. Um, F 22 is now. Yeah,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.970
 it Z. That's when you know, like, finally, all the training that had

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.060
 been doing for the last two years, all of the, you know, times that

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.160
 I heard about it. Now I'm finally in the navy and that that was cool
