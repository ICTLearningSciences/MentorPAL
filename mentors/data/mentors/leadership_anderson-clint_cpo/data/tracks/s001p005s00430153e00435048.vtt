The thing that I found that encourages accountability is ownership. If

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.750
 there's some task that you assigned with, if you're doing someone else's

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.200
 task, then basically, uh, the credit will belong to that person

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.650
 if it gets completed. However, if they say, um, Chief Anderson, this

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.100
 is your job and, um, its success or failure depends on you, then

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.550
 that actually puts ownership in my corner. And that makes me more accountable,

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.000
 because I know that if it's unsuccessful, it's not gonna

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.450
 go to him. That's something that you always have to think about as a

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.900
 leader. Take on every task as if it's your own, and that way you always

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.350
 be accountable for it on Did you get the credit as well as the

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.800
 failures for it?
