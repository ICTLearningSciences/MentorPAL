00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.730
I think a lot of people get put in positions that they're they're not

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.610
 very comfortable with it. It's a part of the quality of being in the

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.490
 Navy. If you're put in a position that you don't want to be in, um,

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.370
 the things you can do is you can apply to other things. Um, if that's

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.250
 not really big option, then you can actually look for the positive

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.130
 things that are in your job and maybe have some kind of lateral rotation

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.010
 if if if if you're not really digging it. So, for instance, when

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.890
 I was in the Tech pub library, we actually have to, like, go up

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.770
 and, you know, like change these books. Um, there are other jobs down

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.650
 in the shop that, you know, I could use my, uh, computer science experience

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.530
 with so maybe actually logging all of the books. I was actually

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.410
 more of a computer science person rather than, like, you know,

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.290
 like someone who wanted to, like, get books and go to these These,

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.170
 uh, these lockers and exchange books. So maybe there's something within

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.050
 the community that you're in that you don't have to change their

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.930
 jobs for, but um that you could do that instead. Um, other. Otherwise,

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.810
 yeah. You might just have toe, uh, tough it out for the year or

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.690
 two that you're doing that job.
