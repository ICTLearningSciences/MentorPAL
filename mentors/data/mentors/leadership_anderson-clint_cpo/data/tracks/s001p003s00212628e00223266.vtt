00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.270
I think the best thing that I learned was how toe look up things. I tried

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.700
 Thio be the best leader that I could all the way up until I was

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.120
 the first class. And that was, you know, going on Google and looking

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.550
 here and, um, asking around and, you know, going to another office

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.970
 and saying, Hey, what's the policy on this, you know, kind of like,

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.400
 uh, wagon, my my telling a circle. But, um, before I joined the chief

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.820
 strings, and especially afterwards, I swapped up my leadership style.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.250
 They actually taught me how to become a better leader. Um, a little

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.670
 bit during, um, my second class and my third class years, but a

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.100
 lot, especially during my first class years. And after I became in chief,

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.520
 uh, they told me which websites to visit. Uh, they told me, like

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.950
 which people in the separate departments toe go visit. So it's not

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.370
 necessarily a skill, um, of knowing how to do something but more about

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.800
 knowing who to talk to knowing that that was a resource that I

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.220
 had that I wasn't taking advantage of before
