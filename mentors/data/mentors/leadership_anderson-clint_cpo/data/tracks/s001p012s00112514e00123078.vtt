00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.950
as a leader, you tend toe, want to move more often. And that's because

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.050
 the the job opportunities become fewer and fewer if you wanna be specific

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.160
 about what you were trying to do. So, for instance, um, I could

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.260
 be a chief wherever I could go to San Diego, Aiken, Goto, Los Angeles.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.360
 I could go toe Norfolk, and they're all going to need chiefs.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.460
 However, if I wanna be, say, a command master chief, then there might

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.570
 not be a role like that, except for a few states. So I have to be

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.670
 very selective in which state I choose. Um, so obviously third class

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.770
 petty officer, you have your watch stations that you're qualified for.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.870
 You have all the training that you've done, and you have a wide

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.980
 range of places that you can go. Um it also depends on the needs of

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.080
 the Navy, but for the most part, you have more choices. But as you grow

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.180
 up as you grow in your leadership responsibilities, they become

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.280
 more and more singular. Until, um, there could be a master chief out

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.390
 there. There could be one job in the whole world that's suitable for

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.490
 him. So, um, just think about the pyramid
