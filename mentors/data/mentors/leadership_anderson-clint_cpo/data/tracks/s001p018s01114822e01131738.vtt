00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.100
just like with any other job, you're gonna find that some people are a

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.340
 lot more vocal than than others. You got to make sure that the quiet

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.590
 people, they still get the credit that they that they deserve. Um,

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.830
 just because you're quiet doesn't mean that you can't become a good

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.080
 leader. Leaders do need to be vocal, especially if you're talking toe

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.320
 many, many people. But for the rule, like, let's say your, um, grading

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.570
 people from being for being a second class and below, or even

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.820
 a third class and below. Um, you're not graded on those types of leadership

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.060
 responsibilities talking to 5, 10 people. So the quiet people

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.310
 need to have just as much of a voice and, um, need to be graded just

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.550
 as well as someone who is very, very vocal if they're doing the same

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.800
 quality work. Eso chat with the people who aren't very spoken. Um,

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.040
 actually, you want to praise and criticized the work, um, at the

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.290
 right locations as well. Um, for instance, there's a quiet person you

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.540
 might wanna mention everyone. Hey, I really respect um, Semen Johnson

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.780
 over here for doing this job. Maybe they might not say anything

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.030
 during that time, But everyone else knows, Like, Hey, you know what?

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.270
 Like that's how I can, um, make my work better. Um, And then privately,

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.520
 obviously, if they do something wrong, um, no matter what their

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.760
 behavior is, you wanna talk to them one on one personal person to make

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.010
 sure that they understand their faults and the flaws.
