00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.360
I think that this environment can be very accepting if you really try.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.860
 But for the most part, looking at the thing that they're asking you

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.370
 to do and then seeing the result from my experience, it seems that

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.870
 most of the time they asked you to do reasonable things in a reasonable,

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.380
 reasonable amount of time. Um, if they say you know what we need,

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.880
 Um, you need to do preventive maintenance on this pump on DWI. Give

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.390
 you like, two days for this. There's almost no excuse for why you

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.890
 can't do it, of course, like let's say you break your leg or let's

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.400
 say you open it up and there's a wrench in there that you have to do

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.900
 something else Thio, you know, like get it out. You know they're those

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.410
 exceptions, But, um, aside from exceptions, the Navy is really good,

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.910
 you know, in the in the top 99 percentile of asking you to do Onley

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.420
 things that you can do. And I think that it's your job that if

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.920
 you cannot do the job in the requested amount of time, it's your responsibility

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.430
 and we train you on this that you have to tell them before.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.930
 So that means with those two things, A. We're giving you a reasonable

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.440
 amount of things to do and be You should tell us beforehand if

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.940
 it ever gets to the point where it's the end and you say I'm sorry

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.450
 it didn't happen. Um, most of the time, I'm not pretty forgiving about

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.950
 that, and rightly so.
