00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.630
the first thing that you should prioritize is, uh, house that you're gonna

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.400
 be living in. Um, one of the major questions that people have you

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.180
 know, especially if they have a family, is, um is gonna be big enough.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.960
 I have some kids, so you might be stationed in a larger place

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.730
 or even a smaller place. Um, rather than the than the base. So you might

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.510
 wanna talk to whatever you need to talk to, to determine, like,

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.290
 how big your house is gonna be, What it has all the tools that you're

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.060
 that you're looking for. And then if it's not, then how do you How

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.840
 do you go about like, changing that living situation? Also the community.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.610
 So I think back in Japan, um, Japan is really, really safe.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.390
 Eso people who tend toe actually want to live off base so that they

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.170
 could be involved in, like, a local stores and and meeting other people

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.940
 rather than on base, which was kind of like far away from from everything,

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.720
 um, maybe they want to go to a different school as well.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.500
 So just keep those things in mind where your kids gonna be going to

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.270
 school and if it's big enough and those should be the two main things
