00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.910
it really depends on how egregious the the assault is. Um, it's not always

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.970
 assault. Sometimes it's limited touching. Um, and maybe if it's

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.030
 a guy or girl, they say, Hey, please don't touch me that way. And that's

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.090
 the end of it that happened quite frequently. Um, I think I probably

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.160
 saw an occurrence of that. Maybe once per year. Um, it even happened

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.220
 with me. You know, like your in your in your in your rack and

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.280
 then someone graduates like, Hey, wake up. You know, like, hey, you

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.340
 know, like, keep your space that happens. Um, you know enough to be

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.400
 noticed, but not, But but the occurrences aren't, uh, so bad that

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.460
 you have to tell your supervisors on. Then you There are some cases

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.520
 that you hear. Hey, you know what? Like um, there's gonna be There is

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.580
 some kind of, um, process with someone in the unit, Um, that that

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.640
 you hear about it. Maybe it's not in your unit, but somewhere on the

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.700
 ship. And, you know, rumors kind of spread. Um, technically, you're

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.770
 not supposed to know about it, because if there is a sexual assault,

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.830
 um, commanding officers is maybe he could know about it, but he doesn't

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.890
 have any names. But in general, people kind of know, um, who is

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.950
 getting too close to other people? And that's when rumors start. In

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.010
 those cases, the person who's making the the the accusation might

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.070
 be sent off the ship, especially if people know about about them. So

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.130
 they're not ostracized. Um, in other cases, you kind of just here that

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.190
 it did occur or had occurred. But people kind of know the rules

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.250
 in place, that you're not supposed to talk about it. So you might filter

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.310
 down to the to the people like, Hey, you know, this probably happened.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.380
 But then then it just disappears. Who knows what happens with

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.440
 that case? Um, eventually, the other person might go to jail, and,

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.500
 you know, you might not not see someone, um, based on the results of

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.560
 the finding, but for the most part you don't know who um made accusations

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.620
 or what specifically occurred, but it does happen enough t b

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.680
 to be noticeable
