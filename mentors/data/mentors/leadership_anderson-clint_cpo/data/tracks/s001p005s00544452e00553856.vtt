00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.350
if I had a problem listening, Let's say they were so uncomplaining. And

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.860
 we have a chat, and, um, he still has the same complaints. That might

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.360
 be an indication that I'm not listening to him. Well, um, I tried

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.860
 myself, obviously. You know, he came to me, and we still didn't have

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.370
 some kind of communication quality communication. So in that case,

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.870
 I know when Thio gather help I might for our next counseling session

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.370
 or if one is needed, I might have a someone else come in. Say, Hey,

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.880
 you know what? Um, give me some perspective on the conversation that

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.380
 me and this other person are having. Am I wrong? It made. Maybe

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.880
 I'm, um, listening the wrong way. Or maybe I'm talking too much. Maybe

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.390
 he's too angry as a third party. You can actually feel that out and

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.890
 tell us where both of us are going wrong.
