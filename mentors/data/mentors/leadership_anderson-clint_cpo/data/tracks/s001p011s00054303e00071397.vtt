00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.800
If you're gonna lead a team, you have to know your own inner workings.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.760
 Uh, let me explain if you've ever seen the movie band of brothers,

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.710
 you might notice that one of the leaders there, he was not very well

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.670
 respected. Um, he thought he was really good at his job, and he expected

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.620
 other people to realize that he was getting a job. But the fact

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.570
 is that he wasn't. Now I'm not the best at everything. Um, the thing

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.530
 is, I realized what I'm good at and what I'm not. As a chief, you

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.480
 always have to present, you know, expertise. But, um, every chief knows

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.440
 that they're not, and where our power comes from is that we can

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.390
 get the resource is to get the correct information. The first time

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.340
 I started doing evaluations, I didn't really know I was reading the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.300
 manual, and it's ah, you know, like, couple 100 pages long, and I have

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.250
 to get this done in a week or two. Um, I actually needed to go talk

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.200
 to other chiefs toe, help me make the correct decisions to make sure

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.160
 that, uh, that I have everything written down correctly. Now, when

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.110
 it's asked me. Hey, you know what? Can you do these evils? My answer

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.070
 is yes. My answer is always gonna be Yes. And it's not because,

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.020
 yes, I have that information. It's yes, I know how to get the information

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.970
 and you will have the correct product by the end of my journey.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.930
 Eso If you can't really do that, then, um if you can't really self

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.880
 introspect on what you're good and what you're bad at, then you're

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.840
 gonna have a bad time. But if you can, then, um, yeah, that's that's

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.790
 on your way to be a good leader.
