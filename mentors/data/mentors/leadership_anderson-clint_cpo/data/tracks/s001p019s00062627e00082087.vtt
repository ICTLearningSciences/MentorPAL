00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.800
a good goal is toe. Go online, figure out your advancement path and make

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.750
 sure that you're checking all the boxes that it takes Thio get to

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.710
 the next level. So, for instance, for first class Petty Officer as

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.660
 an electrician's, um, they expect you to be a leading chief petty officer.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.610
 Or at least, um, and assistant leading Petty officer. Other jobs

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.560
 could be training pair, officer, quality, quality assurance person

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.510
 or three m co ordinator. There are many jobs that you can do at that

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.460
 level. Make sure that you either do one job really well. Eso you

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.420
 really appeal for a long time or you have lots of experience doing

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.370
 all the other jobs eso they that you have a broad range of what they

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.320
 do. So what you don't want to do is, uh, keep doing the second class

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.270
 job that you were doing before, and there's a lot of opportunity for

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.220
 that. You might become promoted, and they're not going to switch

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.170
 you overnight. So if you wanna be promoted, um, faster to the next level,

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.130
 just say, Hey, you know what? I was a second class. I was a technical

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.080
 person. I was going down there in the in the in the turbine

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.030
 generators and opening up cleaning things, and they allow you to do

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.980
 that. But they really look highly on the people who stop doing that.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.930
 Figure out what the first classes are supposed to be doing. Um, if

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.880
 they're gonna be leading the whole entire unit of, like, let's say 15

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.840
 people and start doing it immediately, Um, start seeing what the chief

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.790
 does and saying, and you have to say, Hey, you know what? Is there

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.740
 something that I could do to help you out with that? Yeah, sure.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.690
 Take these papers or Yeah, sure. This is the qualification, Um, of

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.640
 this unit. Make sure that they're all at, you know, 90% or greater a

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.590
 songs. You start taking on the role of the next level above you, or

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.550
 at least like being very, very proficient at the job that you're supposed

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.500
 to be. Um, then you can start doing those things earlier rather

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.450
 than later.
