00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.940
I think the Navy is pretty unique because, unlike other other branches,

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.040
 for instance, I'm thinking of the Army, the Marines and Air Force.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.130
 I'm not very familiar with them, but from what I've kind of seen is,

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.220
 I'm thinking of Let's say, March Air Force Base. I see lots of buildings

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.320
 all around, and I'm assuming that there's a floor for a department

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.410
 and there's, Ah, third floor for another department, and I bet

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.500
 that they don't interact as much. And I bet that that building that

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.600
 squadron doesn't interact as much with the squadron to squadron to

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.690
 the right. Compare that with the Navy when you take all of those buildings

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.780
 and all of those floors and stack them on top of each other.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.880
 And now you have an aircraft carrier which has electrical division,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.970
 mechanical division, the cooks, the boatswain's mates, and you always

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.060
 hear what everyone's doing all the time. This is the one EMC we'd

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.150
 like to think electrical division for fixing the mass. This is, uh,

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.250
 we'd like to thank the cooks for providing a good meal to everyone.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.340
 We'd like to thank the boatswain's mates for guiding us through this

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.430
 treacherous territory. Um, we're all in this. We're all doing general

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.530
 quarters together. That means everyone has, um, firefighting pack

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.620
 on. And we're all seeing each other, talking to each other, seeing

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.710
 each other in the hallways, playing cards with each other during during

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.810
 galley mills. Um, you have a lot more interaction with the whole

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.900
 entire structure rather than being so split up. So I think that that

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.990
 navy it builds it builds community within your work center within

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.090
 your department within the entire ship. And I don't think that other

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.180
 military branches have that as much.
