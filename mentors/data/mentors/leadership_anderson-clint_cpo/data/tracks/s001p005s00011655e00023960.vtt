00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.000
The thing that I think is most important to lead by example on is following

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.150
 instructions correctly. So there are many, many opportunities

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.310
 toe kind of cheese things off, uh, to say, for instance, like there

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.460
 should be a nut that should be taken off off the off the top mast. And

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.610
 for some reason like that wasn't taken off or or something was left

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.760
 up there without a question. You know, some people going to say,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.920
 Well, you know it like next time we're up there or you know what, No

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.070
 one's gonna miss it. That is absolutely unacceptable. Um, every single

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.220
 time, you have to know that. You know, if you're coming to me as

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.370
 a chief, should I blah, blah, blah or you're gonna say, like we think

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.530
 that it might be good to blah blah blah, you know automatically is

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.680
 shot down because there's never any question whether it should or

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.830
 shouldn't be. It's written in black and white, and whatever instruction

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.980
 says, that's what you should do now, of course, uh, in specific

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.140
 occasions, there are way that there are opportunities when you have

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.290
 a choice. Like, um, I can't think of a situation now But, uh, that's

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.440
 kind of not black and white, but for the most part, for jobs, Um, I

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.600
 try to lead by example by always following instructions and especially

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.750
 pulling out construction, reading directly from what it says and

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.900
 then doing it.
