00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.990
an average day for me or an average week for me being the active duty

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.120
 military. Let's say your unemployment. Um, of course. You stand your

 maintenance. You do general quarters every now and then. Um,

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.530
 so for those free time, those moments of free time that you have,

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.670

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.800
 or learning guitar around the corner. They were, like, you know, made

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.940
 their own rock band. I remember I set up a little TV and have this

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.070
 little game console, and I played Star Wars. Um, yeah, I think I played

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.210
 the whole entire game. You know what? I was down there, um, up

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.350
 on the second deck. You know, there are lots of tables everywhere,

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.480
 so you find people playing cards and spades, Um, in some of the lounging

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.620
 areas, you know, a movie is gonna be on. Um, I found that I could

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.750
 draw a lot. I go to the N w r the Morale, recreation and, um recreation

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.890
 welfare office and get all of their DVDs. And I had a little

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.030
 CD player, Um, DVD player and I would play movies toe to my heart's

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.160

 lots of other, like many TV series and stuff. So, um, a lot of other

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.430
 people, they get their packets of cigarettes. I don't smoke, you

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.570
 know? But they go out there to the fantail, look across the ocean,

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.710
 and I have actually spent hours and hours out there not smoking, but

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.840
 just looking at the waves and water. Um, I was on an aircraft carrier

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.980
