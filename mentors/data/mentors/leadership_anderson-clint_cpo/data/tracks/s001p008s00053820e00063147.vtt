00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.660
when you're a leader. That's one of the best things about being in a supervisory

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.460
 position all the way up until your second class. You have

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.270
 someone telling you where to do, where to go, what to do, who to do

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.070
 it with. But when your leader, You have so much flexibility, you actually

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.880
 work Mawr, I think, as a leader. But the point is, you can alter

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.680
 your schedule as much as you want. You can not show up some days

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.490
 if you want. If you feel like, um, some other thing needs your need,

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.290
 your attention, you can actually just other people's schedule under

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.100
 you. If you want Friday off, that's you go into the commanding officer

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.900
 saying, Hey, you know what? Like uh, give us some free time here,

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.710
 and if you think that we should come on Saturday and Sunday, I did

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.510
 that pretty often on my last ship. You say, Hey, you know what? We're

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.320
 doing this in serve. We need you guys toe, you know, bear down and

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.120
 coming on the weekend
