WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.030
even before I joined the Navy, I really appreciated the tech guys there.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.200
 The ones I can think of are, you know, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.380
 Um, more recent ones like Elon Musk. I don't necessarily agree with

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.560
 them, Uh, personally, some of them can be, you know, really? You know,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.740
 like, aggressive on. And I know that business can be cutthroat,

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.910
 but, um, I could get over those those parts. I really appreciate the

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.090
 fact that they had this really big, really strong challenge in front

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.270
 of them that not many people could do otherwise. And these were some

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.440
 of the people that you know that they would be successful regardless

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.620
 of what they did. Let's say they started writing a book, then you

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.800
 know that they write one of the best books you've ever read. If they

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.970
 were artists, then, you know, you know, that they would probably

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.150
 one of the most famous, uh, drawers that that ever drew, you know, like,

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.330
 whatever rule that they're associated with, uh, you can tell that

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.510
 it's about them as as people rather than the thing that they create.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.680
 So I really appreciate those, um, those people for inspiring me

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.860
 to try to do that with myself.
