00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.220
I've never been on a Keiko call before. Um, that's when they go to the

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.590
 family, and they explain what happened. Um, I think they go in groups,

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.960
 and, um from what I understand, they there are two sides to it.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.330
 There's the military side. And then there's the personal side. The military

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.690
 side is when you're very, um, very by the book, you explain

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.060
 what happened. You don't go past what happened, right? You explain to

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.430
 the family, um, exactly the situations around. But whatever happened

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.800
 with that family member, you know, you know, that's kind of by the

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.170
 books, Um, and then you have to put on your personal side. You know

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.540
 what? If you knew the person, then you know, as as a friend, as a

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.910
 fellow worker, that's a fellow human being, you know, this is what I

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.280
 thought of them. This is what the unit thought of them. Um, take heart

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.640
 realized that that the person served pretty well in the military.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.010
 You know that. That's an honorable thing. Um, and you want the the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.380
 family member to feel proud of the person who passed away, So I've

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.750
 never been on one, but I imagine that that's the way that would probably

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.120
 go
