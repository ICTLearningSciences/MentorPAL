If you wanna make a change in the team, you have to be very clear and

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.990
 very organized. What do I mean by that? Let's say you have Ah, unit.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.060
 Who? They're not really working there full day, you know? You tell

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.130
 them. Hey, you know, I'll go out and, like, fix all this equipment and

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.200
 then, you know, half the day is over, and then they come back with

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.270
 only one thing changed or two things changed when it should have been

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.340
 the whole things. How do you change that? Well, number one, you

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.410
 have to be very, very clear. Um, these are the leaders, and those three

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.480
 leaders are affecting thes five people. The place that I've been

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.560
 where that hasn't been, the case was very disorganized, and no one

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.630
 knew exactly what they were supposed to be doing. Another thing about

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.700
 being very clear. Hey, these are the rules that expect you to do You

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.770
 have a white board, you label number 123 claiming cellini cells change

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.840
 the pump, fixed the valve, and then you check on those things.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.910
 Hey, was this done? It is done. Green check. Mark, Wait for the next

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.980
 thing um, yeah. So being being clear and organized are the things

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.050
 that I e I think make the biggest change. Uh, when it change needs to

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.120
 happen.
