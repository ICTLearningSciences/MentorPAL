00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.210
in the Navy. You generally work Ah lot, especially if you're on deployment.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.580
 Um, Sunday's would be your easiest day, and that day would be

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.940
 a six hour watch. And that's a lucky day for the rest of the time. You

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.300
 you wake up a 6 50 maybe a little bit earlier, if you wanna shower.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.660
 If you had the night before you're down in the plants the whole entire

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.030
 day up until 1600 off course, their breaks for lunch, you could

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.390
 go outside and smoke. Um, okay, there. Maybe sometimes that you could

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.750
 take an hour to go to the top of ship to vultures role. They're

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.110
 not pushing you so hard, but they do expect you to be working. You know,

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.480
 the whole ship is working, so it's like a community. Um, where

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.840
 nukes differ from other sailors is that we're expected toe also stand

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.200
 watch outside of our normal, um, our normal workday, which means that

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.570
 we have a five hour watch here or six hour watch there could be

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.930
 in the middle of the night. Could be at night time. There's also general

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.290
 quarters, especially when we're at war time. And we have general

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.650
 quarters every single day. That's two hours, so yeah, you will be

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.020
 worked a lot. Um, and you be proud of it, too. Um, every four days you

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.380
 were up for 24 hours, and then you get your rest and, you know, as

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.740
 a nice young guy, it's good. Outside of the six years that I worked

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.100
 on the aircraft care, Um, just being in the Navy reserves or I think

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.470
 normal people in the active duty, they tend to have 40 hour weeks,

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.830
 which are seven toe, 1500 standard.
