00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.240
being electrician's in the Navy has give me a lot of opportunities to

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.640
 see things, to understand things I would have never thought about before.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.030
 I mean, um, learning some physics in college, I learned about,

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.420
 um, current and voltage and electrons. And, um, even going through

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.820
 the new power school program gave me a really big perspective on life.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.210
 Learn about he transfer fluid flow, chemistry, lots of things. Um,

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.600
 now that I'm in the computer science field in my college, I would

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.000
 prefer that my naval career, um, kind of match that as well. So right

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.390
 now I'm trying to switch careers to b'more I t related.
