00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.270
My favorite movie is actually not a movie. It's an anime. It's called

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.690
 berserk, and I'd always been in the anime. It's like, very colorful,

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.110
 and the themes are great. Um, the first time I actually saw blood in

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.520
 cartoons and most anime. Many enemy are designed for adults rather

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.940
 than humans but adults rather than kids. But really that novel that

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.360
 it's like a novel, it Z like you're watching a novel. But there's so

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.780
 many elements of theirs. Graphic violence, which is great. But the

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.200
 main character, one of the main characters, is so charismatic, Um,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.620
 actually wanted to serve in his army. He was like, uh, this white cared,

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.040
 um um, night. Basically, who, like was tryingto get his castle

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.450
 and just listening to his words just like poetry on paper. And I said,

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.870
 Wow, if I was back in the medieval times, I'd follow this guy. You

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.290
 know, leaders can actually, like, watch this movie and understand

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.710
 how to become better leaders by by acting like him. Of course, he, uh,

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.130
 his situation is interesting, and I won't give away the movie away

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.550
 the movie for anybody that wants to watch it. But between the romance

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.960
 and the violence and the charm. Um, it has everything that you want

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.380
 in a blockbuster film and the fact that it's so long, you know,

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.800
 it's like, uh, maybe you would take eight hours and nine hours to watch

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.220
 it That just made it all the more better.
