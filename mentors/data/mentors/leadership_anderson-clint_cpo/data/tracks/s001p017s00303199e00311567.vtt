WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.220
from my active duty days. There are always temple always periods off high

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.590
 tempo that Yeah, you definitely don't get a breather on. Especially

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.950
 when we're fighting the enduring freedom. Um, yeah, there. There

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.320
 could be, I think every four days you were up for 24 hours. Non stop.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.690
 And, uh, for those for those times, you just have to make sure that

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.060
 the time off you enjoy it to its maximum. You take a nap when you

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.430
 can, you play cards and you get your mind off of work as much as possible.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.790
 But, uh, we're young and energetic for a reason. And, um, yeah,

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.160
 we, uh the youth of us. We don't need that breath. We are. We take

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.530
 it, and we we perform the mission.
