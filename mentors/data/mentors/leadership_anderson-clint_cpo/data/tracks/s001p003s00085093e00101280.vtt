00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.940
there's this quote by Sun suu. I don't recall exactly the words, but the

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.040
 meaning of it really got to me. Uh, it went along. Lines of this,

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.130
 uh, the leaders that are most beloved are the ones that just, like,

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.220
 tell anybody everything, uh, next is most feared, uh, next to the ones

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.320
 who like, um, are really prized among everyone, but the ones who

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.410
 they're most effective are the invisible ones. It basically went like

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.500
 that. So I think that the mawr invisible you are as a leader. Um,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.600
 even though you are controlling things from behind the scenes, uh,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.690
 more credit that you give him, the better he'll respect you and you'll

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.790
 see it, um, devolved into the group. Ah, lot more if they take more

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.880
 responsibility of their actions. Um, even though they have a lot

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.970
 to learn and you are teaching them a lot, um, you don't want that to

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.070
 filter down to the crew. So, for instance, um, my first class would

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.160
 come into my office say, Hey, this needs to be on. I give him the exact

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.250
 instructions so that he can't fail. Then he goes out, and he described

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.350
 it to the crew. Now, little do the crew new do the little Does

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.440
 the crew know that I'm the one who actually explained things to him.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.530
 But he was my, um my go to go through guy. And he's, um that's the

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.630
 way that you are supposed to handle leadership by passing it down

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.720
 through the ranks.
