00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.810
as a nuclear train Electrician's. Uh, one of the things that I got I was

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.770
 really frustrated with was the fact that you don't get stationed

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.740
 overseas. Um, you used to be ableto be sent toe Japan. But when I joined,

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.700
 that was off limits at the time, and we were on Lee stationed

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.660
 domestically, so I went to school. Well, the cool thing is that I got

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.620
 to see all four corners of America. So my school was in South Carolina.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.590
 Um, then I did my prototype. The school lasted about a year and

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.550
 a half. Then I did prototype for six months up in, um, upstate Albany,

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.510
 New York, Um, lots of trees and stayed in a nice house. Um, pretty

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.470
 close Thio downtown New York. Then I went to the lower left toe

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.440
 to San Diego and I'm from California. So I really enjoyed those times

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.400
 those three years that I was there half the time we were on deployment,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.360
 So that's a killer. But my family was in Los Angeles, so I actually,

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.320
 like live with my family in L. A. And every single day I drove

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.280
 the hour and a half toe to my work work was from a, I think, six toe

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.250
 12. And then at 12 o'clock just to be traffic that I drive up to

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.210
 Los Angeles. And time was times of great good weather. Uh, at the end

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.170
 of those three years, then I moved upto Washington, Um, the Washington

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.130
 State. And in Bremerton it wasn't for me. It's it's kind of gloomy

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.100
 a lot. But, you know, you find some things, uh, that are worth Well,

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.060
 lots of movies about my house, about a couple houses up there.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.020
 Um, yeah. You hang out with friends at the local bars and clubs, But

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.980
 after the three years, um, that I was there, I decided to come back

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.950
 home to California. So I'm really glad that I got to see most of America

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.910
 based on the Navy and lots of port calls. Um, so overseas travel

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.870
 as well
