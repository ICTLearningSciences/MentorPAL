00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.020
as a leader, I make sure that everything that I mentioned to them, that

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.200
 there do's and dont's on base off base on this ship or not, Um, they

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.370
 match with whatever the Navy policies are. If you're un deployment,

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.540
 um, obviously is going to change. Uh, especially when you're talking

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.720
 about, like, who can get a hotel with whom and what policies They're

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.890
 gonna be in place like when you're in isolated areas on the ship

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.060
 when you're back at home. Uh, the main thing that you have to worry

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.240
 about is fraternization within, within the units and between the people

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.410
 on the ship when you're outside of base. Then, um, like I tend

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.580
 to let them live their civilian lives. Just make sure that you uphold

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.760
 the Navy's core values. Honor, courage and commitment. Don't touch

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.930
 anyone that you're not supposed to. Uh, maybe keep your words, um,

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.100
 respectable, especially when you're going up the chain. You know when

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.280
 you're talking to officers out out in the in the streets. But in

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.450
 general, whatever the Navy says, that's what I Bye bye
