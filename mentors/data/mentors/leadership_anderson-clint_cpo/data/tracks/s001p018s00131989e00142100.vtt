00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.220
my greatest success has been when I was accepted to U C. Berkeley. That's

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.580
 when I started going to college and I put forth the effort and I

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.950
 actually applied once and I was rejected. Um, I don't think that I

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.310
 had all the classes that you needed to take, but the point is, I didn't

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.680
 really push myself as hard as I wanted to a Zai did in the Navy.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.040
 Um, I think I had, like, a 3.7 or 3.6 or something like that. And,

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.410
 um, I applied and the rejection letter came. And, um, that's basically

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.770
 the main school that I wanted to go to this whole entire time. So

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.140
 rather than give up, Um, actually, I stayed another year, make sure

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.500
 that I finished all the classes that were required, which was a big

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.870
 one. I found out later, Um, but I made sure that I got, like, a basic

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.230
 4.0, that I did an internship that that I started to cross off all

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.600
 the t's and dot all the I's that it takes to get there. And that acceptance

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.960
 letter came and I was ecstatic about that
