00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.820
generally, the Chiefs know a lot more than some of his subordinates. There

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.790
 are times that I'm at a table and we talked for an hour just with

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.750
 the Chang, the chief engineer, the other officers in the units, the

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.720
 junior officers in the unit, about the overall goal of the ship.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.690
 You know what? We have this ship in, uh, in Guam. We need to get it

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.660
 over to this other island. We have these problems with it. You know,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.620
 this pump over here effects this pump be over there and without that

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.590
 pump than this other machine is gonna work, and you have to kind of

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.560
 understand all of it. Now, the sailors under you don't necessarily

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.530
 need to know that whole entire thing. It's gonna overwhelm them. Some

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.500
 of them have just been in for a few months. Others a year or two,

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.460
 and they're they're just getting the feel for the Navy. So they they're

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.430
 not gonna understand all of those other pieces of equipment or

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.400
 how they operate, But they don't need to. And that's the point. That's

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.370
 your whole goal as a chief, to separate the critical from the non

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.340
 critical. Um, so yeah, that our long conversation that I had talking

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.300
 about How we as a group as a ship as a department are going to get

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.270
 the ship from a to B. I filter that down to say, Hey, you know what?

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.240
 Third class, Petty officer, second class Petty officer, We have, uh,

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.210
 that's led to sell. That needs to be taken out and provided with

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.170
 this new one. Can you guys do that? Yes. Thing that that whole entire

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.140
 transformation of getting the ship from point A to B is just whittled

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.110
 down to that one small task for them.
