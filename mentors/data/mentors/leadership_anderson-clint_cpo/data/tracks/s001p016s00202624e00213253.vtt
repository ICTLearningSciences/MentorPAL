00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.750
one of the best piece of information that I got waas when people would

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.650
 always tell me, Hey, you know what? Like find your bibliography and

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.550
 mainly read those chapters before I had never really picked up a bibliography,

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.450
 which is, Ah, a list of books that are required reading

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.350
 for your promotion. When you take the test, they take out little snippets

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.250
 of it or chapters from it. And then, um, they transcribe those

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.150
 into questions on I think they're like 200 questions or something that's

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.050
 supposed to fill out before that, I just thought, Well, you know,

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.940
 like I'm Electrician's, it's my whole entire career. Yeah, you're

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.840
 not supposed to go back and memorize those things. You just, ah, part

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.740
 of you. But, um, the bibliography is, like, really, really shaved

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.640
 down. And, um, it's something that you can study over the course of

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.540
 a few days Ah, week. Or for more hardcore members, you know, an entire

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.440
 month. But it's not. It's not so difficult to actually get into

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.340
 the books and read. So the fact that they gave me the opportunity Thio

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.240
 find out about that material and the fact that they pushed me to

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.140
 learn that material is something that I really appreciate
