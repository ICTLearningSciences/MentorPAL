When you're dealing with subordinates, you have to make sure that they

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.090
 understand your authority and you never want to cross down to them.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.210
 So there have been many times that I've taken people to the side after

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.330
 like, let's say, a heated argument, you know, kind of let him know

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.440
 that I'm a person, that he's a person in my eyes, Um, and even though

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.560
 you want to be their friend, you're not really allowed to, um,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.680
 not until they're your level. So, for instance, if there a chief, then

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.800
 maybe you're allowed to do that. But because there's that there's

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.920
 that line that if other people saw you and realize that you were friends,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.040
 then they would have They wouldn't have the same opinion. I think

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.160
 that they can promote at the same rate as that other person. That's

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.280
 why you choose not to be friends with another person with a subordinate.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.400
 Now that's not saying that you can't be friendly. Friendly

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.520
 is still trying to understand about their their life, their personality,

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.630
 their spouse, their kids, um, wanting to know that information.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.750
 You know, it helps you smile. It helps the day go by it well, but

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.870
 you can't go over their house and play cards with them. You can't, uh,

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.990
 sit down with them at a bar and just drink. You know, the night away.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.110
 All that has to go out the window once you, um, get promoted through

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.230
 the ranks.
