00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.370
my favorite book of all time is this novel called Siddhartha by this German

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.890
 author, Herman Hess. Now, I had read books before That really

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.410
 impressed me. But I, um I never thought reading was gonna be something

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.920
 that I really loved. But in nuclear power school, I remember just

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.440
 picking up the book. I don't know why. I guess I recognized the name

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.960
 from, um Steppenwolf author and stuff. And I read the back of Siddhartha.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.480
 Maybe something interesting, kind of thin. And I was blown away.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.000
 I was It felt like I was the kid from the never ending story who,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.520
 like, had a school and then went up to the attic real quick to keep

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.040
 reading. And I felt like I was in the novel. I felt like he was talking

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.550
 to me. Even though it's like, maybe hey wrote the novel like

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.070
 what, 50 years before that, Um, like, halfway through the novel, I felt

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.590
 like How am I gonna end? How how do I, uh how will I finish my life?

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.110
 Because it was that close to what I felt was a representation of

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.630
 my own life. And that's the first time I have actually really, really

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.150
 read a novel where I thought, Man, the guy writing This is a genius.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.660
 The guy that's writing this is like is breaking down his intelligence

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.180
 into away that's digestible. Tow us lowly human forms. And yeah,

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.700
 the novel, like really opened up my eyes, toe myself to the world.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.220
 Uh, two characters is a good novel.
