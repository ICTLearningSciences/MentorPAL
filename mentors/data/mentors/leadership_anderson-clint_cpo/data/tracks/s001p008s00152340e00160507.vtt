00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.020
personally, I haven't really needed toe change where I'm living that much.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.180
 I've never been really sick. I've never had, um, some something

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.350
 wrong with my bones or anything like that. But from what I've seen,

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.520
 the Navy is really good about giving people the right tools to use

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.690
 if something happens with themselves or their family. If something's

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.850
 wrong with you, then they get you off the ship because it's a pretty

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.020
 harsh environment toe work in. If something's wrong with your family,

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.190
 then they tend to give you all the resource is that they need toe.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.350
 Either get transferred back to the states if they're overseas or

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.520
 get transferred to the crack hospital if, um, if they need that.
