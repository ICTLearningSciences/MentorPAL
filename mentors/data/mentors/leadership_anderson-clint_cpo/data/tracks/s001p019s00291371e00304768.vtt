00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.770
the range of opportunities that you have, like, uh, they can come in the

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.680

 Let's say, um, surface where or fair qualifier. Which means that

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.170
 you know exactly how the surface ship works for the engineering department,

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.090
 and you can train other people like, for instance, cooks and

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.000
 boatswain's mates. You know how your service works. Uh, that's another

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.920
 thing you can put on your on your resume. Soto be able to do that

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.840
 to be able to train other people like that. That's, uh, one way that

 you can expand your career. You can also go to school. Um, everyone

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.670
 goes to a school, at least for uh, if they're a nuke. But there are

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.580
 other schools, like a C school, and there's a long list of schools

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.500
 that you could get from the Web that that you can go to you could

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.410
 go toe school as long as there is a freedom in your department. You

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.330
 could go to school every other year if you wanted Thio. Um, once you

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.240
 get out, then obviously, you know, you can use your Montgomery job

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.160
 Little benefits. Or I guess it's post 9 11. Now that you can, you know,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.070
 go toe, go to school and take educational classes. You can also

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.990
 do that if you're an active duty member as well. I did that as well.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.900
 I think I took two classes. Calculus, um, and in English. But I must

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.820
 admit, it is a little bit harder with, ah, full time work.
