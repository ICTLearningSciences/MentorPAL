00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.760
generally, a decision like that is set, so if you have family and their

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.670
 space available on the base, they tend to want you to stay on base.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.580
 But everything can have a waiver. Um, especially if, uh, they're close

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.490
 to maximum capacity and you choose to wanna live off base, and

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.400
 there's a good reason for it. Then you can talkto to some people and

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.310
 get off. On the other hand, if there aren't that many people on base,

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.220
 it's just cheaper for the military to keep you on base so you might

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.130
 not have a choice in that case.
