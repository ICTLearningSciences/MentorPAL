00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.620
generally, the way the Navy structured is that you could take a little

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.400
 piece from one place and, ah, like, easily slide it into the next place.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.170
 You shouldn't be having any trouble when you get to a new unit.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.950
 Um, I've known several people that came from U. S s warrior and they

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.720
 were immediately put on the USS Blue Ridge and they slid right in.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.500
 You know, after the second day, you couldn't tell them apart from

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.270
 anybody else, somebody that that just came in, he would not be able

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.050
 to say, Hey, you know what? Like this is a new guy. Um, that's the way

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.820
 the Navy is supposed to work when it doesn't. Then that's, uh, that's

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.600
 a time that, you know, you and the chief need to talk about what?

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.370
 What the problems are. Is it a personality problem? Is it the fact

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.150
 that you're dealing with this new equipment, that you don't know?

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.920
 Um, how to operate yet? But it shouldn't be that that case at all ast

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.700
 faras personality. We all try to be the same here. We try to be accepting

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.470
 opening a new person in the unit that makes our our unit better

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.250
 that makes our work go down. So you shouldn't have a problem. Uh,

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.020
 sliding into the unit assed faras work that you're getting, um we

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.800
 generally start you off at the level that you're supposed to be. If

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.570
 you're first class, you should know X, Y and Z should know how to manage

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.350
 your work center. You should know the equipment that you're working

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.120
 on. If you're second class, you should be familiar with, um, how

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.900
 to read Bull's eyes. How Toe transit about the ship. You know how

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.670
 to use the flashlight when it when it's called for how to use your earplugs,

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.450
 you know, basic PPE. So we put you in the place that you're

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.220
 supposed to be. And if you're having conflicts, then, um, that's time

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.000
 to bring it up to the leadership.
