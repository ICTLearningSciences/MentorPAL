00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.070
the Navy is really good about giving you the correct material to use the

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.290
 more dangerous job gets. I've actually been around people who have

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.510
 went into a live 41 60 volt breakers. You touch it, you're done right.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.730
 Ah, friend of mine actually was hospitalized. And what was paraplegic

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.950
 for a while? Another chief friend of mine based on doing those

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.170
 things. And you're around it all the time. Um, but in those cases

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.390
 they give you and you're supposed to use all the protective equipment

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.620
 that is necessary to do the job successfully and safely. Um, so I

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.840
 would say the mawr dangerous electrical work I've done, uh, the more

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.060
 safe I've been. Ironically, it's when you start going lower down the

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.280
 line of risk that your danger actually increases. Um, the most dangerous

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.500
 thing I've done is just being around the propulsion plant, Um,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.720
 and not putting in your in your hearing protection. You know, you

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.940
 do that for a couple of a couple of months, and then all of a sudden,

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.160
 you know, you start hearing ringing in your ears, that Z, that's actually

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.380
 pretty dangerous. That's not something that civilians are normally

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.600
 exposed to. you know. So it's something simple. Like just wearing

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.820
 your PPE is, uh, is probably the most dangerous I would feel. But,

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.040
 like physically the most like on a day basis, the most dangerous

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.260
 thing I've done is probably, um, go up to the top of one of the light

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.480
 mass. We have to change the transistor eyes, me and another guy and

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.710
 you Absolutely, where? The crack material. But sometimes, you know,

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.930
 you have to, like, take off a hook and put the other hook on, you

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.150
 know, and you do that multiple times and you realize that, you know,

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.370
 let's say like you're not paying attention. There could be a time

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.590
 that you're way up there and it's just 11 slight small move, and you're

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.810
 either hanging up there or you actually fall to your death. Um,

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.030
 so, yeah, that's another thing that civilians really aren't really exposed

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.250
 to that if you're long enough, you will be
