00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.130
So I had just given the story about, um, my time on the USS Blue Ridge.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.410
 I was a new chief there, and the unit was basically run by some of

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.690
 the younger 1st and 2nd class petty officers. We had some kind of conflict

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.980
 because, um, it was very lax in the unit, and I had to bring

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.260
 it up toe up to par. That being said, they they were being really,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.540
 really overworked. And I think that's part of the reason that they were,

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.820
 um, being lax because there was no really strong figure toe view

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.100
 them. And when you come in, when you supposed to come in at seven

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.380
 o'clock and your going to Iraq around, like 10 or 11 every single day

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.660
 Saturdays and Sundays included, then of course, you know, if if no

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.950
 one's like, you know, happening you of your back, then you're gonna,

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.230
 like be easy. Nobody wants to work 12, 13, 14, 15 hours per day every

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.510
 single day, right. So, um, in order to get the unit toe where it

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.790
 needed to be, that's actually what they should have been doing that,

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.070
 that we had that schedule so we could make it on time. And, yeah,

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.350
 it required 13, 14, 15 hours per day. Um, but that's because they weren't

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.630
 working at 100% efficiency. They weren't even working at 60% efficiency,

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.910
 right? So the response to that was, we'll just keep working

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.200
 on harder, and I didn't want to do that. I actually wanted to make

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.480
 them more efficient, but also give them more time. So my goal was,

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.760
 Hey, you know what? Let's First of all, let's stop working them so

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.040
 hard, give them more reasonable hours. Once they see that we're giving

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.320
 them a little bit of more freedom. Hopefully then they'll up their

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.600
 game to, you know, So it's kind of like the chicken and egg. Uh, we're

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.880
 not gonna give them freedom until they start working harder. And

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.170
 I want to do the opposite. I want to give them freedom so that they

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.450
 could work harder. So that's where my issues and the and the units

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.730
 on the upper leaderships issues kind of conflicted. But we found a

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.010
 solution
