WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.410
with each new decade. The way I stay in touch, it modifies itself. When

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.980
 I first joined the Navy back in 2000, the main way was, um, actually

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.540
 just driving down, um, making the 18 hour trip from Washington toe

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.110
 toe Los Angeles and yeah, in person. But of course, that gets old.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.670
 Um, I wasn't a letter writer, but I I know that people write letters

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.230
 all the time, and I have paid a pretty penny, uh, making the calls

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.800
 from, you know, from far away. Um, yeah, I saw, like, 102 $100 bills.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.360
 Um, sometimes once the internet started to become more popular than

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.920
 Yeah, a Well, um, later on Skype, the video conferencing really helps

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.490
 out a lot. And then finally, um, now I think everybody has the

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.050
 cell phone. It took me a long time to get one, but now I text and message.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.620
 And yeah, it's super cheap and super free. Super immediate. So

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.180
 those are the ways that I communicate
