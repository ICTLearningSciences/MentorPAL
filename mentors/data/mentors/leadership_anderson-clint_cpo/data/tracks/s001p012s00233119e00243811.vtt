00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.570
personally, I love traveling in the Navy. I didn't really get to travel,

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.290
 do the work while I was on active duty. But as a reservist, we travel

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.000
 all the time. In fact, we travel every single year, so they could

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.720
 send me from my home in Los Angeles, toe Norfolk. And once I get

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.440
 to Norfolk, the flight there is paid for, Um, you can stay at a hotel,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.160
 you get a certificate of non availability, which means that you can

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.870
 stay at any of the hotels off base or if they have government hotels

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.590
 on base. Then you get to stay at a nice hotel and with with maid

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.310
 service and breakfast, most likely they even pay for your car. So as

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.030
 long as you keep the receipts or you type it in tow the website, um,

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.750
 the travel website, Then for the most part, um, once you get back

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.460
 home, they'll give you the cash right there on the spot. Sometimes

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.180
 you're there, you're traveling and you need some cash. Uh, that shouldn't

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.900
 come from your normal paycheck. Uh, then you actually write a

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.620
 write request and they give you advanced pay. So basically, you don't

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.330
 have to really worry about money when you're traveling as long as

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.050
 like you write the correct paperwork. Um, it should all be free and

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.770
 paid for by the military.
