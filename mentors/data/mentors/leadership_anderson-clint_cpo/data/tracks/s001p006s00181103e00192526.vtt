00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.760
the biggest type of problem that I deal with our behavioral problems in

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.660
 the Navy. You have such a wide variety of people. You have people

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.570
 from down south. You have New Yorkers. You have people that have a slight

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.480
 racist twinge that you try toe, you know, modify and say, Hey,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.380
 you know what this is? We don't work that way. Here, let me help you.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.290
 Um, you have some people that are go getters and superstars that,

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.200
 um, should are gonna go all the way up to see, you know, if you let

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.100
 them, um yeah, all the ah wide range of people that you have to, um

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.010
 You have to get them to feel that the way, the way that Navy feels

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.920
 the best way I can say this is that somewhere in the middle of boot

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.830
 camp, um, there's a first class out there he was explaining to all of

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.730
 us. You know what he pointed to the whole entire room. You know, we

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.640
 don't know where you've been. We don't know where we've come from.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.550
 Some of you have had a hard life. Some of you have had some of you

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.450
 have had an easy life. Um, but no matter what, you all your own navy

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.360
 right now, and we have to make sure that you I understand those core

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.270
 values honor, courage and commitment, uh, in whatever you do. So my

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.170
 job is a chief is to make sure that everything that comes from all

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.080
 of my sailors, um, attribute those values.
