00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.800
when I was growing up, I I would say that it should have been involved

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.760
 with lots of bullying, but I had a different take on my actions. I

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.710
 had these glasses and, you know, thick glasses before, Um, you know,

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.670
 when they didn't, when they couldn't fit it out. I had these, like,

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.620
 um, glass holders, you know, that my grandmother gave me and, um, I

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.580
 also spoke proper and being in all black community, I was kind of looked

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.530
 at as, ah, prior it. Uh, I should have been the target of pulling

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.480
 a lot. However, when I experienced that, I would kind of just keep

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.440
 to myself, you know, I said, Well, you know what? Like thes thes

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.390
 people, Of course, there are lots of kids and you always, like, go out

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.350
 there, play tag with them. You play football with them. But I just

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.300
 kind of saw that they weren't, um my crew basically and kind of just

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.250
 stuck with myself. Um, that was when I was a young kid. Maybe before,

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.210
 you know, 89 I then went to Germany, and I started living on a

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.160
 on a military base. And after that, things completely changed. I think

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.120
 I had one or two more bullies after that. But for the most part,

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.070
 because we were all there, we all had a decent salary. We all had toys

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.030
 and games and intend does and bikes. And, you know, life was really

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.980
 good. And I think that that's one of the reasons that bullies exist

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.930
 because they're having some kind of problem with their lives on day

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.890
 kind of wanna, you know, spread the hate around. But when you're

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.840
 having, when you have a decent life when your when your father is in

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.800
 the military or your father is in the Army, your mother is like an

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.750
 admiral or something, and you have a standard paycheck. And, um, you

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.700
 can actually make your parents look bad if you do bad. If someone bullies

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.660
 mean, you know, their parents can actually hear it. So bullying

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.610
 basically stopped once I started going to Germany. Um, I was like

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.570
 that for two years, you know, great life. And then after another year,

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.520
 and then I went to the German section of Germany, and, um, even

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.480
 though I had the glasses, you know, like I was actually looking cooler

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.430
 at the time was actually also working out. Um, then I became a superstar.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.380
 So for that year and a half, from seventh grade to eighth grade,

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.340
 Um, I was the most popular kid. Girls were liking me, and guys

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.290
 always wanted my friends, you know, invited me to their house. Um,

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.250
 life was really great. So my whole point is to say this once after spending

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.200
 those three years of building my confidence in Germany once

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.150
 I got back to the States. Um, yeah, of course. There were bullies there,

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.110
 but it just flew right off of me. You know, I said, you know what?

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.060
 Like I'm I'm a superstar, you know? You can't touch me. I'm really

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.020
 smart. Um, enough girls told me that I'm really handsome, you know,

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.970
 like So who are you? You know, like, there's nothing that you could

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.930
 possibly say that could actually like, Get me down, you know, and

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.880
 I e think I kept that, um, in high school junior year and senior. I

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.830
 was actually working out a lot. I think I had the body of a football

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.790
 player and I also got contacts. I mean, then I was I was actually

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.740
 really popular kid in high school. So, um yeah, I brushed, pulling off

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.700
 a soon as I went to Germany because I found a place Thio get my confidence

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.650
