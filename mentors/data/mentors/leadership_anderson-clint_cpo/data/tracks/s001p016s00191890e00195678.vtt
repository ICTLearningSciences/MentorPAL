00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.640
you can tell who you can really rely on based on two things. Number one,

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.430
 they're experience. If they have a long history of actually doing

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.210
 right things, um, then you can tell who the superstars of every unit

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.000
 are gonna be. And number two, um, as a result of that, as a consequence

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.790
 of that, what people are saying about them Hey, you know what?

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.580

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.150
 mostly been some kind of first class from some kind of hotshot first

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.940
 class whose, uh, checked all the boxes, and you can really get a

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.730
 lot of critical information from the superstars.
