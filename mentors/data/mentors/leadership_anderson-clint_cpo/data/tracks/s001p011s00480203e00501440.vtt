00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.740
people leave the Navy for a lot of different reasons. I left the Navy

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.640
 the active duty Navy, because I wanted to have ah, college career at

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.530
 the school of my choice, studying what I wanted to. And that really

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.420
 wasn't a Knop shin for me When I was in the military, they wanted me

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.320
 to study nuclear engineering at a certain school, um, in a certain

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.210
 part of the country and actually wanted to do something different.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.100
 I'm still in the Navy, you know, part time. But it's not, you know,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.000
 active duty. Um, another reason is that people would leave the military

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.890
 is because it's not designed for them. You know, we try to snuff

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.780
 those people out during boot camp, but we don't get everyone. Um, you

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.680
 still have people who are just, um uh, complainers who are aren't

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.570
 good workers who don't work well with other people in in teams. Eso

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.460
 those kinds of things, they actually come out when you're working for

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.360
 the 2nd and 3rd and 4th year. And to tell you truth, it will probably

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.250
 be the best interest of the Navy that they're not there. That's

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.140
 a safety issue, or that's an efficiency issue. Um, so it's better to

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.030
 get those people out so they don't want to be here and to tell the

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.930
 truth, like the Navy confined other people that can replace them. Eso

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.820
 people that don't wanna be here, people that wanna a different career

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.710
 for wanna go to college. Um, maybe this was just, um, to set themselves

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.610
 up in life. Like even if I didn't want to go to college, I

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.500
 would still probably thank the Navy for the skills that they gave me

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.390
 and then continue on toe like a higher paying job in the outside world.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.290
 And there's places for people like that. In fact, the Navy actually

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.180
 came up with a new retirement system called the Blended Retirement

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.070
 System, which, um, is focusing on the people who know that they're

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.970
 not gonna have a 20 year career. Um, for the people that are gonna

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.860
 be in for 46 years, they say, Hey, you know what? We'll set you up

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.750
 with your life. You be a veteran, you get these experiences, you conserve

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.650
 the country and thank you for being on our ship. In the end,

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.540
 we'll give you the Montgomery G. I. Bill or the post 9 11 bill. A zit

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.430
 is now and we'll give you some cash. Um, for your retirement that

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.330
 you can use later on. So it depends on what you want. And, um, yeah,

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.220
 there's so many different reasons that I could list them all.
