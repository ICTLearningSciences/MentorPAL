00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.120
each day can cause lots of emotions, depending on like what you were doing

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.390
 for that day. Let's say someone made you very, very mad and your

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.670
 super angry and you're punching walls, right? Uh, things can just

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.940
 be blurted out. Um, it's not my call Thio determine whether they're

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.210
 just blurting something out or if it's the, uh, combination of a long

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.480
 history off something that's been on this person's mind that I just

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.750
 haven't been aware off. It's not my call. As soon as they say, um,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.020
 I'm thinking about committing suicide. Uh, all of the my thoughts just

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.300
 go off off off until you get to the switch that says, Hey, you know

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.570
 what? Tell somebody about it. That one goes on and then you direct

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.840
 them straight to the to the expert. I'm not an expert
