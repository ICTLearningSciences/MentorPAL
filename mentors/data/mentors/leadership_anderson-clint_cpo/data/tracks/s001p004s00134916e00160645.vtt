00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.280
I grew up in Flint, Michigan. And as you might have heard from news, it's

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.710
 not the, um, brightest spot to be. I think the people, they're fine.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.140
 I had family there, more family than I had ever had. Cousins and

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.560
 aunts. I had my mom and my sister and lots of kids. So there is a

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.990
 strong family connection there. Um, that I couldn't deny ast faras being

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.420
 poor. Um, I don't think that inherently, I'm I have the poor psyche,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.850
 you know, I always do that. I would be successful in life regardless

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.280
 of what was in front of me. That's what everyone always said.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.710
 You know, like, hey, you know what you're not gonna be, um maybe growing

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.140
 up in this area, you know, like you're not gonna This area is

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.570
 not for you. You, in fact, somebody I remember somebody actually said

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.990
 you're probably gonna be a rocket operator. And when I was working

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.420
 at NASA, I thought, you know, like some guy knew that when I was six

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.850
 years old, you know, it's it's not a coincidence. So, uh, even though

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.280
 I was in the midst of poverty and I can imagine a few a few cases

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.710
 where it could be worse. I mean, I had rats and mice at, uh, cockroaches

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.140
 everywhere. I had prostitutes. Um, yeah, yeah. Drugs was affected

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.570
 me a lot, you know, very close members died, you know, they lost

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.000
 their feet. They were in wheelchairs. Um, in every single case, I

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.420
 decided that that wasn't that wasn't going to be my life. And that wasn't

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.850
 the way I was going to present myself to the world. I think if

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.280
 you if I was to go anywhere, no one would be able to recognize me from

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.710
 growing up in a in an upper scale. You know, California home, because,

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.140
 like, that's not the way I talked that I wasn't involved with

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.570
 hoodlums. Uh, even though I was around drugs, I never tried it myself,

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.000
 and I avoided people who did it. So all of that combined just it

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.430
 was easy to ignore. Uh, that that's a bad word to say. Of course it

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.850
 was apparent, and there's no way that you could ignore it, But it's

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.280
 easy to put in your back pocket and say, You know what? There are other

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.710
 things more important. Um, let's just focus on them. That's what

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.140
 I did
