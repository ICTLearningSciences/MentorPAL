00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.940
the people that gave me the best advice about my career. Um, isn't actually

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.040
 just one specific person. It's a group of people. When I became

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.130
 a chief, um, I went through the indoctrination process, which is,

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.230
 ah, couple of month long tour that they send you through. They teach

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.320
 you all the books that you're supposed to read. They make sure that

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.420
 you have some kind of basic understanding about all the procedures

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.510
 and the admin requirements that are that are that are necessary. But

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.610
 throughout the whole entire process, um, in bits and pieces the Chiefs

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.700
 would actually like give me a little piece of pieces of advice to

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.800
 help me in my career. One person was really good at y and stuff, and

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.890
 he showed me, um uh, kind of like like the path that he took and

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.990
 some of the problems that he was going through. Another electrician's

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.080
 kind of help me with some of the background information about, um,

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.180
 about yeah, training myself and my crew on balking about the surge

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.270
 Main unit like how could help them, you know, become better themselves.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.370
 There's so many, like, um, small pieces that I guess a group of

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.460
 30 chiefs gave me during that indoctrination time that I really think,

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.560
 you know, I consider as a whole. You know, the chiefs and Doc process

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.650
 help me out a lot.
