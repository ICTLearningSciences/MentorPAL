Well, things change all the time. But currently there is this, um, website

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.980
 that you can go on. It's called CMS I d. That gives you a list

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.540
 of opportunities that are currently available. I think, uh, it's changing.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.110
 It might be my navy assignments right now, but any other case,

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.670
 it's, uh there's always a website you can go on that you put in your

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.240
 information you put in your past and you put in the things that you

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.800
 know about your things that you're an expert on, and then they kind

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.370
 of match. You doesn't have to exactly match your rate, but, um, it

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.930
 should be in the same general feel if you're doing electric. Um, if

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.500
 you have an electrical rate, you can do some kind of engineering job,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.060
 so it might be a mechanical. It might be a neat job, but a so long

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.630
 as you have some kind of experience with it, um, you have a little

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.190
 bit of freedom toe get those jobs based on the website based on what

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.760
 they need
