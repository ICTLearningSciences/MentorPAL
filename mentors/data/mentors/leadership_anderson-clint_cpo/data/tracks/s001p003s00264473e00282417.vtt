WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.170
the most difficult part of my training, I would like to say, should be

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.500
 new power school. Um, that's getting up early in the morning until

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.820
 evening. You, of course, have time for, uh, toe workout. You have time

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.140
 to eat lunch, But when you know, there's a test on Monday and you

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.470
 don't really know much about the material, you spend that whole entire

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.790
 weekend from sunup to sundown just studying. And I would like to

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.110
 say that that whole entire two year training that I had learning about

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.440
 electron ICS and he transferred fluid flow and nuclear technology

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.760
 in chemistry. Um, doesn't quite compare to the training that I got

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.080
 once I got to the USS John C. Stennis that a lot of, um, even non nukes

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.410
 are gonna experience. And this is what I mean, when you're in school,

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.730
 you're in a nice, safe environment. Um, the sun is shining. You

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.060
 can kind of see out the window, but basically, you're at a desk and

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.380
 you're typing and your writing and your, um, listening on did you

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.700
 don't develop too much sweat. But when you're on the ship, uh, you

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.030
 can have some days that are just as long or even longer. Um, when things

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.350
 could break because of you, when people get hurt, sometimes when

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.670
 you're falling asleep. But you're keeping yourself awake by drinking

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.000
 lots of coffee. You know that training on and it is called training

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.320
 because the whole entire time you're learning your actually doing

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.640
 doing doing thin learning, doing, doing, doing, then learning, Um,

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.970
 but that those years of my lives of my life was very intense, Thio,

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.290
 to say the least.
