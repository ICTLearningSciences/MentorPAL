00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.460
you can tell if someone's going to be a good mentor by how much you see

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.080
 them interacting with other people, whether they're a good listener

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.690
 and whether their hands on. For the most part, I found that chiefs

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.310
 are really good about that When I'm down in the plant. If I'm, let's

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.920
 have a new guy, their third class, you know, working with another

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.530
 person, you know, trying to, you know, fix, fix, fix the breaker. If

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.150
 I look to my right, you know, see in the next room that there's a chief

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.760
 down there with his flashlight, um, talking and explaining has

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.380
 the procedure out saying, You know, pointing with his finger touch that

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.990
 do that. It's not like this. He puts the he puts the book down and

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.610
 he goes down there and he starts the process. Then he puts the picks

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.220
 the book back up and has the other person continue. The people that

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.830
 interact like that, those are the best mentors. So you try to find

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.450
 someone who's going to be very interactive, not just listening, but

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.060
 also, you know, like, um down there in physical person with doing

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.680
 the maintenance, then you know that they're going to be good to go
