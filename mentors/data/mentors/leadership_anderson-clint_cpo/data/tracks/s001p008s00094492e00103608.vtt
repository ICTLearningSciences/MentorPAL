00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.790
being a leader really affected my life. You know, a lot of different ways.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.720
 I remember being a second class. I would really want to finish

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.660
 the work immediately. And then once I get home and I just leave my work

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.590
 at home, uh, I'm playing video games. I'm watching Netflix. I'm

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.530
 watching movies, and I don't think about work again until I come back.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.460
 However, when you're a leader, um, I tryto leave work at home. Um,

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.400
 I try to leave were at work as much as possible, but I do find that

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.330
 I think about it a lot at home. That's when you're making spreadsheets

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.270
 for the people. That's when you're emailing other chiefs. That's

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.200
 when you're talking about like, what's gonna happen the next day?

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.140
 Um, at 8 p.m. Or nine pm with with other leaders, other officers so

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.070
 it can affect you throughout the whole entire day. Um, once you become

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.010
 a leader
