00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.780
the things that keep me up at night are the things that I find myself

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.710
 most scribbling down on a sheet of paper, which is what my job is gonna

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.640
 be two years from now. Right now, I don't know. I'm a crypt, um,

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.570
 a cyber security analyst at the Naval Postgraduate School. And eventually

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.510
 we're gonna have to have a job. Maybe it's gonna be in research.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.440
 Maybe I'll be working for NASA. Maybe some federal job in Japan.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.370
 Who knows where it's going to be. But until I have that job, you know

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.300
 the job. That's gonna pretty much dictate the rest of my life. Um,

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.230
 it's kind of like, uh, not worrying a little bit exciting, but it's

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.160
 the thing that keeps me up at night.
