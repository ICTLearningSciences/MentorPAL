00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.860
for me. It, um, being a stepped out just came really, really easily. When

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.870
 I started living with my wife, she was actually pregnant, and she

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.880
 broke up with her boyfriend. So I was there when, um when her her

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.880
 daughter was born and that daughter, like, really grew on me. That's

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.890
 one of the reasons that we got married in the first place. Um, having

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.900
 the kid, you know, changing diapers and putting around my arm going

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.910
 to Seaworld with them. You know, you you really get thio to feel

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.920
 that even though you didn't conceive the child that, like, there's someone

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.930
 out there in the world who needs me, who wants me, who says that

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.930
 they love you. Um, and as long as like, you don't get too hung up

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.940
 on the biological aspect of it. Um, you really you really, really

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.950
 grow on you
