00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.070
if I'm in a situation that, um something is amiss, and I didn't cause

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.290
 it, Um, a lot of times you're still gonna be blamed for it. Anyways,

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.510
 you just realize that's the way that it is. It's always been like that

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.730
 at every single command that have had. Um, it's even like that in

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.950
 the civilian world. So number one don't take it to heart. No one's

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.170
 gonna be blaming U. S. Oh, that's wrong. They will blame you, Right?

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.390
 But in the end, everyone realizes that you're human as well. And especially

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.610
 the officers they can kind of see whether it's your fault

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.830
 or not. You know, like as a chief, you could say, Well, we didn't get

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.050
 this maintenance done. Um, it's up on. The folks will super, far,

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.270
 far in the front. And I've been in the galley in the kitchen all day

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.490
 with this 111 thing the officer can say, Well, you know what? The folks

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.710
 of things should have been done. And it's your fault, Chief. And

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.920
 the wrong answer is to say, it's not my fault. I wasn't there. No

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.140
 chief will ever answer that way. The correct response is well the officer

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.360
 is not actually blaming me. He's the one who sent me to the galley

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.580
 to fix things, but it's his responsibility to make sure that it

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.800
 gets done. And he hasn't put some blame somewhere, right, because you

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.020
 know, it wasn't correct. So the blame has to go somewhere. But he's

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.240
 not blaming me. He's not blaming me. The chiefly leader, right? Um,

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.460
 s o just accept the fact that the thing wasn't done and then find

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.680
 out where the blame should be. Should be focused, right? And then creek

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.900
 that that problem. But don't take it to heart. Don't take the complaints

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.120
 against you, Toe heart. If it is your fault, then of course,

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.340
 fess up to it, you know? But if it's not your fault, don't place

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.560
 the blame in other places. The goal is find out where the blame is and

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.780
 then correct it there without being so defensive about it.
