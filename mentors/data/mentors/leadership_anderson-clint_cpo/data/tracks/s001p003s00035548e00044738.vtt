00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.560
there are many tones that you can have when your leader, um, they range

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.260
 from being very, very direct. Especially if you're out there, you

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.970
 know, huge strong person, um, able to lead, lead the pack. Um, if that's

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.680
 not the style of the style that you were brought up in as when

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.390
 you were growing up, that you might want to take more of, ah, friendlier

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.090
 turn a friendlier, friendlier tone. So, for instance, um, people

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.800
 can come to you and you work through problems together. Um, it depends

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.510
 on the type of person that you are. But in any case, everyone has

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.210
 understand that you're on the same team. So with that in mind, when

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.920
 they come to you, whether they know that you're gonna be stern and

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.630
 strict and maybe have a few, um, strong words in there or if you're

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.340
 nice and sweet and kind, uh, they have to know that you know what?

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.040
 Like they're gonna give you a high five at the end of the day and say

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.750
 Yes, sir. Yes, ma'am, I'll go do it
