00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.780
the trick that I tend to use a lot, especially when I'm dealing with other

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.710
 people. And, uh, one person isn't satisfied with the other, whether

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.640
 it's my leadership or whether it's someone subordinate to me. Um,

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.570
 yeah, after chatting with them and trying to talk things out, especially

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.500
 if that doesn't work. Even if it does, you should just go up

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.430
 to the top. Um, look at the stars, Look at the sky, look at the sun

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.360
 and, you know, breathe. Think about other things in your life. Think

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.300
 about you know what this is. Ah, job. And it's a stressful one. And

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.230
 it's the one that you signed up for, and it's actually exciting in

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.160
 a lot of cases. Um, once you understand your you know, you just one

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.090
 little cog in the Navy and that you know you'll get past whatever it

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.020
 is that you're facing, it's easy to go back down and say, All right,

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.950
 well, let's go ahead and do this whether you're frustrate or not

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.880
 or not. You just breathing its's gone
