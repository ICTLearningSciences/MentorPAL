00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.850
Well, first and foremost, I want to say if it deals with safety, then

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.840
 breaking with the rules, it is never okay. But there are many situations

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.840
 that, um aside from safety, that you can kind of squeeze under

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.830
 the rug. If there's a person, that's, let's say, um Miss three, 33 three

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.830
 get togethers, three musters. And then, um he misses one more,

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.820
 and that that fourth one is gonna be the one that, you know, loses makes

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.820
 him lose his rank. You don't wanna have something so strict on

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.810
 him just yet. You want to understand the real reason if he's missing

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.810
 the fourth one? Obviously, you had a conversation, but maybe you haven't

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.800
 had a personal conversation yet. You have a chief or leader. You

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.800
 have to make that determination. You know, like, before I make some

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.790
 very drastic move on something really, really small. Uh, let's get

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.790
 a little bit more information about it. And, um, if the final explanation

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.790
 was good, like, oh, you know what? My car broke down. That's

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.780
 a good one. Um, the Navy has really strict policies like Well, you

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.780
 know, it's the fourth one. So regardless, no matter what? Then? You

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.770
 know you lose your rank. But as a chief, I can say you know what? Like

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.770
 I can understand that. You know what? Um, we're going to forget this

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.760
 one. I'm going to say you came in and we need to get your car fixed,

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.760
 you know, because the solution isn't actually correcting the problem.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.750
 Um, the first three times, maybe he was just coming in just because

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.750
 he's lazy. But we already had that conversation. We already sat

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.740
 down and said, You know what? You're not gonna be lazy anymore. If

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.740
 you do it again, then you know, like the result is gonna come. But

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.730
 when it when it violates the prior agreement, you as the chief can

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.730
 actually, um, use your power to, like, kind of over over overlay those

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.720
 rules and, you know, do the right thing instead of the by the book

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.720
 thing.
