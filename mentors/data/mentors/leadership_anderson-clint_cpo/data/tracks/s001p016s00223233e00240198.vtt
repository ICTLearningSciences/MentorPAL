WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.590
For the most part, I'm pretty satisfied with the way that my active duty

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.320
 career went. I went to the ship that I wanted to go to some place

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.060
 in San Diego, and I'm from California. It's where my family was. So

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.790
 I'm glad I got that. I went upto Washington, and, you know, it wasn't

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.530
 a choice of, uh, ships we were actually like I moved there because

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.260
 of a ship swap. But, um, yeah, there's no choice with that. And then

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.000
 and then I got out. Um, but two years before I actually got out of

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.730
 the service at my six year point, you're supposed to actually do short

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.470
 command, and I've never experienced a short command before. I had

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.200
 only been on a ship at that time and, um, the recruiter actually

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.940
 said, Hey, you know what? Like we have some opportunities for you, you

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.680
 could become an instructor in New York or he actually gave me the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.410
 opportunity to go to ah submarine tender in Italy slash Guam. And I

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.150
 didn't do either one of those. And he was kind of pushing forward the

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.880
 benefits of both. You know, if I was an instructor, that would have,

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.620
 you know, actually patted my resume a lot. It's actually in a field

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.350
 education field. Um, that that I'm doing right now, which I really

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.090
 wish was on my resume. Um, at this time, Um, and if it wasn't that,

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.820
 then it would have been going toe Italy. Like I would have loved

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.560
 him. Italy, I think. You know, I always wanted to go to Europe, and

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.290
 I actually jumped over that opportunity to, you know, experience that

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.030
 foreign country. Uh, because, uh, yeah, it wasn't the exact specific

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.760
 place that I wanted to go to, so I wish I would have listened to

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.500
 him at the time. And, you know, further my naval career.
