00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.300
I've known someone who I worked with for several years who was seriously

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.760
 injured. Um, they were going into, ah, 41 60 fold panel. And even

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.210
 though they had some safety application safety precautions on, they

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.670
 didn't understand, What kind of voltage is, uh, they were actually

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.120
 checking, and I'm not very familiar with the situation, but some kind

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.580
 of precautions were relaxed, and they had a really big spark in front

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.030
 of them. There was a big explosion. Um, some people were hurt, but

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.490
 the person that was directly inside, um, my friend, he was hospitalized

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.940
 for close to a year, I think. And then, um, was in a wheelchair

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.400
 for a little bit longer after that.
