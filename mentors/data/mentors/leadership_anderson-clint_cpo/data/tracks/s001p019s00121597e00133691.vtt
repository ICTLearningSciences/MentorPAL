If you're looking for a new role to help you advance, you have to make

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.210
 sure number one that it's in your field. You could do tons of jobs

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.890
 around this ship, but if it's not in your field, then it's not gonna

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.570
 quite help you so much. So I think the main source is probably gonna

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.250
 be your chief. Uh, he's gonna tell you, or she will tell you, um,

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.920
 the rules that are available. And sometimes there are things that you

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.600
 don't even no pertain to your rate. One for me was three. M coordinator.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.280
 I didn't realize that that was a job that a new could take on,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.960
 but it's a high, high, high position job. Another one that was hidden

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.640
 from me that was going on behind the scenes was, uh, the Tech Pub

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.320
 Library, the Technical Publications library. And you have to be really

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.000
 on familiar with all of the books that are associated with the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.680
 nuclear field. And you have to know, like where they're supposed to

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.360
 be located. Um, and you also help out when people are doing research.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.040
 They say, Hey, you know what? Like there's this schematic that I need

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.720
 you should be able toe, you know, find which book it's in and do

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.390
 some of the basic research for him for that. And that's another thing

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.070
 that can promote you. So, um, your chief and other supervisors in

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.750
 your chain of command can actually, like, point you out to some of

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.430
 these jobs that can kind of, like might be something different than

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.110
 what you're used to but might be hidden from you or might be useful

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.790
 in ways that you didn't know about before.
