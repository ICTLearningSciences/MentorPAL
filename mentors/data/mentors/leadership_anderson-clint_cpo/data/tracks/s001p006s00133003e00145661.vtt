00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.410
from for the Navy. I've had lots of different types of work. I I never

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.960
 just stood in a desk, and I've never been in the plants all day. I've

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.520
 gotten an opportunity to, um, be up in the stan Shins and fixing

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.080
 lights painting. I've been in the nuclear reactor room, you know, like,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.630
 um, overseeing maintenance that was going on by contractors, Um,

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.190
 as a senior enlisted adviser And what you grew up in the ranks. Then

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.750
 you you start to do actual work less and less, and it switches over

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.300
 toe overseeing work more and more. So, for the most part, I, um, at

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.860
 least for the neighbor reserves as a senior enlisted adviser, I get

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.420
 the information from my first class is about, um How the units going

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.980
 where they're going, Um, how they are on the training. Um, I help

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.530
 them out with their evils. I tell them what to do. Which chapters to

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.090
 look at, um, things like that. Um, when I grew up when I was going

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.650
 through the navy as an electrician's made, I spent a lot of time in

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.200
 the plants that's picking up a song hammer and way. Don't use saws

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.760
 and hammers, but way use our volt meters. We use our resistors. We use

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.320
 our screwdrivers and wrenches opening up panels, Um, checking them,

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.870
 cleaning them, um, doing preventive maintenance on them, Um, oiling

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.430
 them up, things like that.
