00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.800
if you're going to join any branch of service. One of the things you need

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.750
 to learn how to do if you're not on board yet is learn how to listen

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.700
 to people you're gonna be getting a lot of directions on your career

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.650
 is not gonna go very far If you can't follow them from the simple

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.600
 to the complex. You know it's gonna be coming at you all the time

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.550
 every single day, several times a day. The way that I prepared for

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.500
 myself, um, for coming into the nuclear power school actually started

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.450
 training. Um, I took a conceptual physics course and I took algebra,

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.400
 and that helped me through the school. Later on, um, after going

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.350
 through my initial school thing, I found out that, like, uh, even though

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.300
 there are schools available most of the time, you have to actually

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.250
 train yourself. So learning how to read is another big thing that

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.200
 you have to know. Um, if you haven't been a big reader before, especially

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.150
 in high school or middle school, um, that's gonna change if

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.100
 you're gonna be promoted. Um, of course, there are lots of opportunities

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.050
 and lots of training, but the ones I see succeed the most are

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.000
 the ones who actually can pick up a book on their off time and kind

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.950
 of teach themselves.
