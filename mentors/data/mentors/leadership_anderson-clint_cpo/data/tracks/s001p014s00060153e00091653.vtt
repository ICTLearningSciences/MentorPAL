00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.750
The most challenging part of my job is probably the most important as

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.650
 a military person in general. And that's taking ownership of whatever

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.550
 it is that you're doing, especially in new school. You actually have

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.450
 toe go to the library, get the steam propulsion manual and start

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.350
 reading, you know, left and right. You don't know something's And yeah,

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.250
 you have some access to other people who know where the material

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.150
 is, But they actually like force you to do a lot of research on your

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.050
 on your own to do the homework on your own. I don't think Yeah, After

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.950
 you start getting a certain G p a like 3.8 Onda above which I had,

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.850
 they don't even expect you to do homework. They just have the tests

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.750
 and say here, you know, you you study night and day Do do baby sit

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.650
 you, um, in a school toe degree. So, for instance, if you're not doing

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.550
 well, you know, you have, like, less than three point? No. Then

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.450
 you have an extra 20 to 40 hours extra that they expect from you. I'm

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.350
 I'm assuming that other, um, eight schools are similar, but maybe

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.250
 not that intense. You know, maybe the material isn't quite as dense,

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.150
 but, um, they do hold your hand through the education. You only have

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.050
 yourself to blame if you don't go through that. But after the two

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.950
 years of a school, uh, then they let you free. You're free to go and

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.850
 especially nukes. They expect you toe, you know, be smart to accept

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.750
 the training. Some of its really dense and you, you know, way above

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.650
 your grade. Your pay grade. So, um, especially the first year, too.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.550
 They're talking about the top of the, um, aircraft carried all the

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.450
 way to the bottom, to the left and right. And, you know, the electrons

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.350
 that go into it, the things that they need to purchase and how the

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.250
 Cellini cell works on the inside. And, you know some of those things

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.150
 you you barely glossed over in a school. But now they're giving

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.050
 you an in depth, um, rundown of each thing and it, you know, it just

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.950
 goes over your head. But the fortunate thing is, you don't have to

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.850
 memorize those things. I think a lot of it is just they just want you

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.750
 to have some experience with it. And after two years or three years,

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.650
 then you become a pro. And there's this, like path that you're supposed

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.550
 toe, you know, adhere to the whole entire time for you to become

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.450
 that pro. Um, so when you're going through it at the at the very,

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.350
 very beginning, you're you're not sure about how much you're supposed

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.250
 toe ingest. Technically, you could spend all watch just reading

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.150
 all books, which is what they expect you to do, which is what they tell

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.050
 you to dio, um, you could spend, um, you know, hours after your

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.950
 eight hour workday just still reading and still not read enough. You

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.850
 know, it's an infinite amount of material that should be covered. That's

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.750
 gonna help you get promoted on the test. You know, the higher

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.650
 your score like, let's say, um, you score really well and then you will

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.550
 be promoted based on, like the percentage that you score above other

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.450
 people. So, yeah, the cool thing is, there's a there's a range

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.350
 for everyone. So if you don't score pretty well, then you know you get

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.250
 promoted a little bit slower. And if you do, um, just read nonstop

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.150
 constantly, then their path for you to become an officer toe get promoted

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.050
 early. So, um yeah, As long as you take ownership of yourself,

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.950
 then I think that that's probably one of the most challenging things

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.850
 that you have is a military person in the new field.
