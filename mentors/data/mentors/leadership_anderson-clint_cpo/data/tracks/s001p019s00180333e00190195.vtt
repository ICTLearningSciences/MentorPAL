00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.760
When I first joined the military, I actually wanted to be a cryptologic

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.670
 technician. And instead of taking the test, I think there's this test

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.570
 called the D lab that you, uh, takes about an hour or two. And they,

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.480
 um they tell you if you can learn a foreign language or not, rather

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.390
 than give me that test, they actually had to take the nuclear test.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.300
 And because I did really well at that test, they kind of pushed

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.210
 me into that, um, that field. I don't think it was the field that I

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.110
 was, um, mainly interested in, and in fact, like I was kind of anti

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.020
 engineering at the time. It worked out for me. In the end, I'm glad

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.930
 that I had all of the experience that I that it wanted to with it.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.840
 But I think if I would have went to cryptologic route, um, that lifestyle,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.750
 I think, would have been more in line with what I was joining

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.650
 the Navy for, and I think I would have benefited from a little bit

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.560
 of help in determining, like how I could get into that field from the

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.470
 get go
