00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.720
Whenever I come across self doubt, I look a my past successes in life.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.590
 I was the one who was accepted to become a chief, which is a very,

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.450
 very hard thing to do something that takes a lot of like, um, long excellence.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.320
 Thio actually have happened. Um, Thio and I was the one that

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.190
 they chose. It builds my self confidence. I look at the fact that

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.060
 I was accepted to Berkeley. There's some people who have had a really

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.930
 great life, have had tutors and have been trained on distill Don't

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.790
 get accepted to that university, and I was accepted. That builds

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.660
 my confidence. I have to say that I was in the military, and particularly

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.530
 I was a nuclear trained engineer. There's some people who can't

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.400
 get into the military through their past criminality. Or maybe they're

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.270
 out of shape. Or maybe they just don't have the discipline. You

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.140
 know, I had that. I'm a veteran myself. I joined the long ranks of

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.000
 people, um, who have been veterans, and I've pride for that. You know,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.870
 that builds my self confidence and particularly the nuke field. That's

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.740
 something that I hadn't been trained for. The my whole entire

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.610
 life. I wasn't a really good student in school. And yet here I waas,

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.480
 learning what some would say is one of the most difficult things to

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.340
 learn. In general, in life, there's rocket engineering and nuclear

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.210
 engineering. You know, those are the two ones that are that are thought

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.080
 off as being really difficult. And here I was a nervous kid from

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.950
 Michigan who is actually studying this stuff. So whenever I come across

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.820
 something new, something challenging, I just have to remember Hey,

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.680
 you know what? Like I could do this because I've done almost, um,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.550
 the hardest things that you can do as an American and I was successful

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.420
 at it.
