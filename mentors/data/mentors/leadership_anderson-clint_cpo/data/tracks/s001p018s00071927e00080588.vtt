00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.090
The thing that makes me most proud is when others tell me how I help them

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.320
 and that can come in multiple forms. When I'm at a local restaurant

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.560
 and it's Veterans Day and someone buys me a beer, they say Thank

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.800
 you for service, Um, that that really gets me because, like, I do realize

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.040
 that, um, that's not just, um speaking from nothing. They know

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.270
 that I actually went halfway around the world and I was fighting for

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.510
 their rights to be free, fighting for their rights toe so that they

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.750
 could enjoy this life, and it's tough. Some of us were in danger

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.990
 there, especially like soldiers on the ground who were shot. And we

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.220
 put ourselves through that and we come back for him to acknowledge that

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.460
 that makes me very proud.
