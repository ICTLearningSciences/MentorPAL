00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.610
in order to get to the root of a problem. In some cases, of course, it

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.380
 depends on the personality. But I think one tried and true trick is

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.140
 toe kind of take off your badge for a second. You know, pull the person

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.900
 over to the side and say, Just ask him. You know what's really

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.670
 going on? Um, you lay out the what you think are the issues, what you

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.430
 think are the problems. Well, you know what? Like you've been coming

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.190
 in late three times in a row. Um, you missed this assignment. Um,

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.950
 What's going on? And now they can correct you and say, it's not like

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.720
 that or they can give you the responses. It's up to you to decide

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.480
 whether the responses are correct or not. But you can attack those issues,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.240
 right? And find out. Hey, it's actually a family issue or hey,

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.010
 it's actually, um, the fact that that person doesn't like another

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.770
 person in the unit, and they had an argument that you hadn't heard about.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.530
 So you need toe. Um, step away from the chief aspect for a moment,

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.300
 because if you still have it on, it's like, Hey, I'm a chief. You

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.060
 need to tell me what's going on then. They're just gonna be just

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.820
 by the book. But if you want to get into their personality, if you want

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.590
 to get to the real reason that they're having the issue, you kind

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.350
 of talk to them as a person. You never truly give up your chief, Um,

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.110
 your chief rank. You know, they still they still maintain that distance.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.870
 But you want to, um, let them know number one? You can be a

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.640
 friend to them. You know, that's what we're all supposed to be were

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.400
 employees. But we're also working together as compatriots, right? So

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.160
 get yourself in that friendly mode. You're not an officer. An officer.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.930
 They do need to keep that separation. But as a chief, you can get

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.690
 a little bit deeper into that
