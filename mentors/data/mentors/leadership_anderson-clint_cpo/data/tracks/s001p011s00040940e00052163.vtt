There are many types of ways that you can consider important. Um, one

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.350
 would be when you're dealing with naval careers, when people come to

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.600
 you about their officer package, when people come to you about, you

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.850
 know, like, um, problems emotionally and financially and with their

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.090
 significant other those are the most important decisions that I make.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.340
 However, um, I think although Chiefs can do that role, that's a role

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.590
 that's that we don't do that often. The vast majority of the time

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.840
 are really small things that we do that really, um, make the day to

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.090
 day operation run smoothly. We got to get people on their 80 s. We

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.340
 have to make sure that the training is up to date. We have to make

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.590
 sure that everyone has their medical. You know, those are the things

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.840
 that the commanding officers really, really depend on us for. Um, they

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.080
 have this chart that says okay, 70% complete for training, 30% complete

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.330
 on medical. Oh, that's a red flag. You know, we need to get

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.580
 on that, you know, And those are the things that are the most. I guess

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.830
 really, the truly important things that we need to do as chiefs make

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.080
 sure that everything is up to snuff every single day
