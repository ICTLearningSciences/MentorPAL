If you're gonna try to lead honorably, you have to remember what uniform

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.730
 you're wearing. You have to think about all the people that I warned

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.670
 it before. And you have to make sure that you're not going toe ruin

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.610
 that name. The good name of the Navy. The good name of the military,

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.550
 the good name of America. Especially if you're overseas. Um, I'm

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.490
 not going to say that This is always so easy to do. I've been in ports

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.430
 where Hey, New Americans air here, and you've been underway for

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.370
 two months, right on Lee on the ocean as far as I can see, And you

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.310
 get, uh, toe land. And some of those values actually are diminished

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.250
 because you're in this new and exciting environment. But you have to

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.190
 keep in mind. Hey, you know what? I'm an American representative. If

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.130
 you're on domestic soil. Hey, you know what? I'm a military representative.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.070
 And if you're in your unit hey, you know what? Like I'm an

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.010
 electrician's and they have to know that my chief and my leadership

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.950
 and the people around me take care of me. And they told me the right

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.890
 things to do. They instill me with honor, courage and commitment,

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.830
 and I have to make sure that wherever I'm at, um, that that's what's

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.770
 expected of me, and you have to live to fulfill it.
