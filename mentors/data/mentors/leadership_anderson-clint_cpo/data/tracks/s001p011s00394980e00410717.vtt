00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.720
the risk of an electrician's generally depend on other people. You were

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.590
 working, um, in two pairs, right? So there could be a lot of times

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.460
 that, um, someone's working on some kind of electrical equipment, and

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.320
 you have to trust that they did their job correctly. You're putting

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.190
 your hands in some breakers, and you're not gonna have all the electrician's

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.060
 all check the same exact panel, right? So you just have

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.930
 to depend on them to do their job correctly s so that you don't get

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.800
 electrocuted. For the most part, I I didn't really trust too much that

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.670
 that's just a general, um, general thing with me, because I I've

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.530
 seen some some shady stuff in the past, and I just tend to not trust

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.400
 so much. But, uh, there's a point, you know, there's a point that,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.270
 you know, what if they're all the panels are off and you're going inside?

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.140
 Hey, you know what? Like the person is not going to turn this

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.010
 thing on, right? The danger tags are all correctly written, right? Um,

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.880
 the person that actually read the tag correctly, right? Those are

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.750
 all trainings that we've had in the past. So You just have to assume

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.610
 that, um they read it correctly. They did their job correctly. Uh,

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.480
 they're gonna operate the equipment correctly. And now you are, uh,

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.350
 piggybacking off of that and and continue the work based on what they

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.220
 did.
