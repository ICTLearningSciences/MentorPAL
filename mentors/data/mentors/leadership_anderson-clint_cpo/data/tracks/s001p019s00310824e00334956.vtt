00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.880
in my career. I think I find that every single block above me is a leader

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.920
 that I look up to. The main one that I have is, let's say, the Devo,

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.950
 um uh, the devil could actually be a young person, maybe just two

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.980
 years in, but they've given been, given the responsibility to look

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.010
 after the unit, and they've proven that they can. They've been given

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.050
 the commission, and for the most part, like like they take it on

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.080
 full charge. And they have a lot of interesting things that they could

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.110
 tell you toe s O that you could grow as a person as well. Um, a little

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.150
 bit above that is the Chang the chief engineer? Um, that's for

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.180
 normal surface ships. I just came back where we had an awesome chang.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.210
 Who? I think she was a mechanic, but she had a, ah, large understanding

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.250
 of the way the entire plant worked. And I got a lot of information

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.280
 from her on a aircraft care. You have the reactor officer whom

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.310
 I didn't experience s o much, but I still look to them as a leader

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.340
 because you could not tell that they were not the captain of the ship

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.380
 the way they move, the way that they talked the way that they carried

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.410
 themselves. Um, everything that they did was very, very disciplined

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.440
 and organized. And you knew that nothing on that ship would be wrong

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.480
 if they were in charge. That's the way that they carried themselves.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.510
 Um above them is the CNO and then the president. I like to them

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.540
 a lot less. Obviously, you know, they have the whole entire, um, service

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.580
 to run. However, they are our commanders and chiefs. So whatever

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.610
 they're doing, you have to make sure that they're leading by example.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.640
 Um, you filtered that down to the troops. So if they're saying,

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.670
 hey, you know what? We have to go to this area and these are the reasons,

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.710
 you know, you have to take that on, and you have to, like, present

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.740
 that presidential atmosphere to the rest of the unit. Um, of

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.770
 course, it could be a little bit political when you're talking about

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.810
 you know, the president less political when you're talking about the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.840
 CNO. You know this, you know, has mainly one idea for everyone and

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.870
 depending on in for the president, depend on whether it's a Democrat

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.910
 or Republican or some other party like, um, it might be hard Thio

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.940
 get completely behind all of their words. But, um, those are the things

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.970
 that you focus on. You focus on the mission, the mission of the

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.000
 ship, the mission of your aircraft here, and yeah, you should. And I

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.040
 think most military people do have the impression that he is our leader.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.070
 And he's the example that, um, that we're following. So yeah,

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.100
 from the president all the way down, toe the chief right beside me.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.140
 You look toe everybody around you, all your leadership, Um, for that

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.170
 for that experience.
