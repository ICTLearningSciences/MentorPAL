00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.580
I think the two main things that are gonna shake my future well, I'll

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.310
 say three, um, number one. How hard I work for the next two years while

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.040
 I'm in this Masters program that I'm in right now. Um, the second

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.770
 thing is, what job is going to take me as soon as I'm done? It can

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.500
 range from anything from the National Security Administration to, ah,

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.230
 University to NASA. Who knows what is what's what's gonna happen.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.970
 But I'm not in control of that. Um but I think probably the most important

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.700
 thing for me is who I'm going to meet for, uh, my my spouse.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.430
 I'm looking at all the time, and I think I didn't realize how important

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.160
 was before, But I definitely realized, um, you know the person

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.890
 you're gonna wake up beside, where you're gonna have kids or not even

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.620
 whether I'm gonna buy a house and settle down in a city or not all

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.350
 those things depend on you know who I choose to live life with
