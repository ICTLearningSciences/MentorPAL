00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.890
after being in the Navy for so long as a chief, I think one of the things

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.930
 I'm trying to work on is become a an officer through the direct

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.970
 commissioning officer program. If that doesn't work out, then there

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.010
 are other opportunities for me. As a chief, I could be a chief warrant

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.050
 officer. Or I could continue my, uh, enlisted career as senior chief.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.090
 Or, you know, with the goal of eventually becoming a master chief

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.130
 for the civilian side. Um ah Ah, cyber security analyst. I'm going

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.170
 to school for computer science, and I'm hoping that that degree will

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.210
 lead me to a federal job. Um, maybe working for NASA may be working

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.250
 for a federal research lab or maybe someplace in Japan, which is,

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.290
 uh, one place that I'm really eager to get back to.
