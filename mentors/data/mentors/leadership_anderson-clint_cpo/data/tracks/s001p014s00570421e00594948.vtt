WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.090
one situation that really struck me is, uh, you know, having a profound

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.330
 effect on my career is when I was down in one of the plants and another

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.560
 crew member asked me, Hey, can you help me out with my maintenance?

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.800
 I said, Sure, I'm free. Hey, took me thio these two boxes and

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.040
 for most of the maintenance requirement courage, it takes one person

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.280
 to kind of look, um, maybe be a safety observer and explain things

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.510
 and another person actually be in the in the in the equipment. And in

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.750
 order to do any maintenance down in the nuclear power plants, there's

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.990
 a long process. You have to get permission from the watch officer.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.230
 You have to hang danger tags. You have to have another person go

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.460
 around and look at the danger tags you have tow. You know, say that

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.700
 you're ready to work. You have to go down to the plant and actually

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.940
 like, set up the proper equipment. You know, there, we try to make it

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.180
 a safe. It's possible. So he said that he had done all of the requested,

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.420
 um, you know, background stuff. And he said, Yeah, you know,

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.650
 like I just go up there. But I think I was changing a V c. I or actually,

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.890
 there was something that I had to do. Ah, electrician's wise.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.130
 Um, but he had me do it now. He said that it was the energized and he

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.370
 did the de energized checks. Um, and I actually, like, looked at actually

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.600
 like, um, I think that I checked it myself, or maybe I didn't,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.840
 but, um, I did all the all the maintenance for it. I clean the inside.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.080
 I was exposing myself to electrical wires. And then I shut it,

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.320
 and I looked at the sheet of paper and I was actually working on the

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.550
 wrong breaker. So he's the one who actually opened it. And he said,

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.790
 Yeah, it's ready to go. Hey, just need another person. But I was actually

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.030
 working in ah, free electrical breaker. And I think it's 450

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.270
 volts. Um, so I was pretty upset about that. Um, Or maybe it was 1

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.510
 20. I'm not I'm not really sure, but yeah, that I should have never

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.740
 been in that situation. And rather than go up until the Watch officer

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.980
 rather than make a big scene about it. I, um I got really frustrated,

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.220
 you know? I shut the door. You know, I didn't yell at him or scream

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.460
 at him. I just said, You know what? I'm never gonna put myself in

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.690
 that situation again. I'm gonna check every single breaker, every

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.930
 single tag. I'm always gonna look read every single instruction because

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.170
 I don't trust anyone at that time. And that was wrong. I should

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.410
 have ratted him out. I should have, um, made sure that he wasn't put

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.640
 in, that he wasn't able to put other people in that situation again.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.880
 And that's unethical thing that, you know, I e actually got wrong.
