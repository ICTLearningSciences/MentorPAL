00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.300
my most favorite place to live occurred when I was a kid. I was, um, in

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.750
 the military at the time, But my father was he was in the Army. I

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.190
 think he was in the six at the time, but at that time were staying on

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.640
 an American base and life was great for me. I didn't grow up rich.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.090
 I had very few things, but he had a decent salary and could provide

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.540
 me with something. For every single holiday. All of my friends were,

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.990
 uh we're in a similar position. Um, that that I had They had parents

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.430
 that were officers or high level, um, enlisted people. And we had

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.880
 lots of toys to choose from. We're all together playing, playing in

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.330
 the sand lot. Um, using, you know, like a fake guns. And the roller

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.780
 skating rink was 25 cents. I think all the food at the commissary was

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.230
 super cheap. Eso chief, that you could buy, like, tons and tons of

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.680
 food with a $5. Uh, the $5 allowance that you've got comic books were,

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.120
 you know, like, I guess tax free. Everything about the military

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.570
 base was annoyed. Idealize, uh, society. So, um, that's one of the

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.020
 reasons that I joined, um, later on in in in my career
