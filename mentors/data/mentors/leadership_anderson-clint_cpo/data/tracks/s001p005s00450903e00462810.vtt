00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.800
the best way to develop your skills when you're working with teams is

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.760
 to number one kind of get to know them. Um, what's an interesting situation

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.710
 is when you go into a table and you're not familiar with any

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.660
 of the faces that around, um, people say things that because you don't

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.620
 know them personally, it's just a statement, Um, that they say,

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.570
 And you, you don't put it in the context of the type of person that

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.520
 that is, uh, for instance, somebody should somebody could say, Hey,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.480
 you know what we need to have, you know, all of electrical division.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.430
 Go down, um, and sit around the determine generator and make sure until

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.380
 it's fixed. If you didn't know that, that person meant that, Hey,

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.340
 you know, it's like, uh, it's a department wide thing and he's not

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.290
 saying every single person cool down there. You could think that he's

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.250
 a jerk. Um, otherwise, you could Let's say he's a really strong

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.200
 character, strong leader, and he really does mean hey really doesn't

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.150
 want people to go down there, every single one of them, right? If you

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.110
 didn't know that he has a long history of being successful that is

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.060
 really respected in his unit by his department, then you also you

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.010
 might think he's a jerk. But if you know where people stand and why

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.970
 they're saying the things that they that they say, you can really respect

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.920
