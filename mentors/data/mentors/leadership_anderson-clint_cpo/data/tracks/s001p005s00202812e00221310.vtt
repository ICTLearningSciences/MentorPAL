00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.740
sometimes stories, air called for it. And sometimes, um, they're not One

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.630
 example could be. Let's say you had an outing. Uh, your younger Navy

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.510
 years where, um you wanted you wind up at some shady place that

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.400
 you weren't supposed to be at. Um, there is an officer in the corner,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.290
 and you kind of like, slipped out of out of sight. Let's say it's

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.180
 past curfew or something, and you were there when you weren't supposed

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.070
 to be. Now, of course, that could make for a good story. You know,

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.960
 when your third class or second class. Um, But if you wanted to say

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.840
 the same story as a chief, then people might lose respect for you

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.730
 even though it happened. And even though it is something to explain,

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.620
 because it does happen a lot, you know, um, you don't wanna mention

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.510
 those types of stories to your subordinates because number one they

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.400
 think that your actions air right. Since then, you've learned that

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.280
 they're wrong. Since then, you would have changed. But you can't explain

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.170
 all of that to them. You're not going to say Yeah. I was speeding

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.060
 at 100 MPH on the I five, um, and smiling at it because, like, even

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.950
 though you say Well, you know, since then, I've slowed down. Since

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.840
 then, I have a family. They're not gonna listen to that. They're just

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.720
 gonna listen to the part where you were speeding and they can speed

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.610
 now, too. So there's a time and a place for everything. Um, if if

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.500
 it's a story that makes him smile and builds, report builds morale,

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.390
 then go ahead and throw that out there. If it's a story where you've

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.280
 changed your mind and you don't think that you have the tools necessary

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.170
 or at least amount of time necessary to explain that it was,

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.050
 uh it wasn't something that you're supposed to be doing, even though

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.940
 it might make for a great sea story. You should put that in your back

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.830
 pocket.
