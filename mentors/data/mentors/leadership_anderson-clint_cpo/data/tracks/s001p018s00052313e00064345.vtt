00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.670
The most important thing I've learned about life is something that I always

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.500
 took for granted. I grew up with, ah, strong family, their cousins,

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.320
 their aunts, grandmothers, my mom and my dad and even a brother.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.150
 But slowly, I have actually siphon them all off. And right now, I

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.970
 don't really have a strong family network that I could talk to right

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.800
 now. I thought, Well, you know what? I'll make a family later on in

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.620
 the future. And here I am past my forties, and I still, um, don't

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.450
 have a wife, don't have any kids. And I've been focused so much with

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.270
 work that I've actually forgotten the things that are most important,

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.100
 which is developed, that family structure. It's been around me. I

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.920
 knew that it existed, but maybe I never found the right one. I used

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.750
 to be married before, and it was to the wrong person. I used to have

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.570
 girlfriends that were the right people, but I didn't, you know, take

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.400
 the take the bait. And here I am, you know, like ah kind of kind

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.220
 of alone. And I think that it's important for me to find someone for

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.050
 me to make my mark for me to have a kid that I can, you know, pass

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.870
 my legacy on to for me to have a wife that I can grow old with and make

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.700
 sure that in your naval career you don't forget those things. And

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.520
 that's one of the main things that you're fighting for your fighting.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.350
 For others, it's true. But don't forget yourself in that others

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.170
 mix.
