00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.920
something else that you need to know, especially uh, when it's concerning

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.990
 leaders is that you have to be the role model, and I know that's

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.060
 cliche, but you have to keep in top physical forum. There'd be sometimes

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.130
 when I'm when I was a second class or third class and we look

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.200
 at some of the Chiefs and you know they're around big guys, you know?

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.270
 And although they're very well respected, obviously, you know, they

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.340
 became chiefs and and, you know, we go to them all the time for our

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.410
 problems. Uh, in the back of our minds were just thinking, Well, why

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.480
 isn't this person in shape that's always at the back of our minds?

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.550
 As a leader, you have to be the role model. You have to be in the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.620
 top 10% of all the runners. You have to be the guy cheering people on.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.690
 You can't be the guy that people are worried about, right? Um, even

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.760
 even though if it might be true, obviously everybody can have their

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.830
 own problems and stuff, you know. But when you're projecting your

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.900
 leadership on other people, they have to be the lower ones and going

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.960
 up to you, and it hasn't always be that way. Um, maintain your military

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.030
 bearing, right, Uh, for any of the chiefs that that that I've

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.100
 seen that were wrinkled or creased or something like that, um, you're

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.170
 always gonna compare them to the hot shot first class that that's

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.240
 there, and you're gonna make that comparison and you never wanna be

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.310
 underneath. Ah, first class. Uh, if you if you're a chief for above,

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.380
 um, if you have a hot shot, then you have to be a hotshot to they have

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.450
 to see like, Hey, you know what? That chief is the one who made

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.520
 that first class be that way. So, um, a Sfar is your physicality ous

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.590
 faras your uniforms assed faras your speech as far as your connection,

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.660
 whether the people, as far as your quickness to anger all of those,

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.730
 have to be, um, at the at the top of their game. And I know it's

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.800
 a lot, but you're gonna have many years to prepare many years to practice,

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.870
 And they're gonna be other chiefs out there who wanna make sure

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.940
 that, um, all your tiny little problems, um, are chipped away, edged

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.010
 away at until you're a military model of a leader
