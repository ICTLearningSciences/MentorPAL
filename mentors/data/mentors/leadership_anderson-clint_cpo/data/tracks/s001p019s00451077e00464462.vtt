00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.120
I was really fortunate. Thio take part in mainly all of the ways that

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.380
 the maybe give you, um, educational opportunities. When I was on my

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.650
 ship actually took two classes. I took a calculus class and in English

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.910
 class for Free Aceh, Long as it was after working hours. Um, while

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.180
 I was on deployment, which was great, I actually went thio several

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.450
 schools. They send, you know, to a two week school or even a month

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.710
 long school. I got advanced electrical, um, knowledge based on, uh,

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.980
 those many schools that I went to, uh, when I became a reservist, they

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.240
 actually, like, send me the other schools as well. There, too. You

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.510
 do your annual training, which is two years. Uh, I'm sorry to two

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.770
 months that two weeks that you go out and you do your your normal training.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.040
 But then they provide opportunities to go to schools, uh, ranging

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.310
 anywhere from two weeks or two months or, um or even longer so

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.570
 that you can put adventure. Your professional career also did, uh,

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.840
 the Montgomery G I. Bill and the 9 11 bill. I had the opportunity to

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.100
 experience both of them. Uh, the G I Bill, they just gave you money

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.370
 based on whether you're in college or not. And the 9 11 bill, they

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.640
 actually, like, pay you, um, your living expenses and your tuition it

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.900
 as well as some book fees. So they break it down a little bit more.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.170
 But I think that actually, uh, end up giving you more money as well.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.430
 So those are all the ways that I found? Um, you can have, um, educational

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.700
 benefits through the navy. There are a lot more.
