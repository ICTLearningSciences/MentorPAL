00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.640
the cause of the most stress is when you have a job that needs to be done

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.430
 and you're not the one doing it, especially when you deal with people

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.220
 who don't have as much ownership of it as you would like them

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.010
 to. So, uh, one case that a recent experience I was a chief in charge

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.800
 of in serve and we have to make sure that all of the electrical equipment

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.590
 across the whole entire ship was complete to satisfaction. And

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.380
 you send to Electrician's up there. Maybe it's a third class and

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.170
 a seaman apprentice. You send another first class here to do that job

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.960
 second class here to do that job, and you have to walk around as a

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.750
 chief to make sure that everything gets done. And there's no way that

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.540
 you can check every single thing. And yet, like you realize that

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.330
 if something isn't done particularly right, we check an automatic bus

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.120
 transfer and it doesn't transfer. You know that's gonna look bad on

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.910
 you on the sailor, slightly but more on the department in general,

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.700
 and it's it's kind of scary, you know, like like for most of the things

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.490
 I wish I was the one doing it. I wish I was the one, you know,

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.280
 correct. You know, correcting things, But, um, we don't work in that

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.070
 environment. We work in a team environment, and as a team, you actually

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.860
 have to really depend on your other team members. So some of them

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.650
 you wish were a little bit stronger. But that's a part of being in

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.440
 the Navy. That's a part of, like, training people. That's the part

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.230
 of, like, learning from your mistakes and making sure that, like, um,

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.020
 hey, you know what this was done incorrectly. Let's get it right

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.810
 the next time.
