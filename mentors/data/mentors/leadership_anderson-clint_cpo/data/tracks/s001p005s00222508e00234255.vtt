00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.930
The most important piece of counseling that you can hear is that you have

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.000
 to listen. There have been so many times that I've actually witnessed,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.080
 um, counseling sessions that go on where the person that was

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.160
 giving the counseling was speaking a lot more than the person being

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.240
 counseled. Um, whenever I've seen it, I've I've kind of explained, you

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.310
 know, like, hey, you know what? Like it's a it's a listening session.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.390
 You can give them the tools. Hey, they wanna be an officer. Fine.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.470
 Give them the material. Hey, they want to win an award. Okay, tell

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.550
 them what it takes to get that award. But for the most part, counseling

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.620
 is kind of It is a back and forth session, but it's also an opportunity

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.700
 for the person being counseled. Toe let go of some of the

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.780
 things that were on their minds. Um, if it's for a positive award, um,

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.860
 let them explain things to you so that you can take material toe.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.930
 Take notes on how you can help them get that award. If it's a behavioral

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.010
 counseling session, then let them explain their story to make

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.090
 sure that you have all information. So that You know that you're not

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.170
 mistreating them so that you have the full story, that, uh, so that

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.240
 so that they feel that they've been they've had their full story heard

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.320
 and that you can that the justice will be fair.
