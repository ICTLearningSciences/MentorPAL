00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.000
being in the military is kind of like what it depicts on the TV for a

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.140
 lot in a lot of aspects. So, for instance, um, there's the Brotherhood.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.290
 Uh, that's absolutely true. Uh, there's, ah, stable paycheck. That's

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.430
 also right there is exploring different parts of the country that

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.580
 all of that is absolutely true. And you'll check all those boxes.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.720
 Um, What I have found that the preconception that I had coming in that

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.870
 hasn't been true is, um Well, I want to say the fitness, we're all

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.010
 kind of fit, and I think we're generally more fit than the rest of

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.160
 society. However, I thought like you'd be big and strong and, you

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.300
 know, exercising every day. And, um, that's not quite true. In the Navy,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.450
 at least it might be for the Army or the Marines or other services.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.590
 But for the Navy, um, generally, you're stationed on an aircraft

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.740
 care and there are tons of electric of exercise equipment, no doubt,

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.880
 and you can go at five o'clock in the morning and you can see it's

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.030
 full. They also give you lots of Jim facilities that people go through

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.170
 all the time. I was in the basketball court almost everyday. However,

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.320
 um, it's generally not so required that you're exercising, um,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.460
 with everybody at the whole time. My dad was in the Army and I actually

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.610
 saw his whole crew like running around the building, run around

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.750
 the camps and things, So I thought I'd have a similar experience with

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.900
 the Navy. But that's actually not true. Generally your physical

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.040
 fitness is more your own thing, and you could just get tested on it

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.190
 a lot.
