WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.680
currently. I'm not married. That doesn't mean I'm not looking. I got married

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.520
 pretty young. I think I was 24 or something like that. And e

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.350
 got married for the same reason that everybody else does. Um, my wife

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.180
 was, uh, model in my eyes. You know, she loved me a lot. I was really

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.020
 good friends with her family, and I thought that that was a good

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.850
 reason to get married. However, um, I think the only reason that you

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.680
 should be married is you have someone who's supportive of you, and

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.520
 you expect to grow old with them. And I don't think that that was,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.350
 uh, the reason that I got married. We were married for eight years and

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.180
 we broke up a lot. We, uh we were separated a lot. I think we got

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.020
 married. And then pretty soon after that, I I went on deployment. By

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.850
 the time it came back from deployment, we were already separated.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.690
 We got back together. Um, but then, of course, I go to another state,

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.520
 and her kids were in school in California. I was in Washington, Um,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.350
 another separation once I got out of the navy, Um, then I finally

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.190
 came back to California and we tried again. And that's when our personalities,

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.020
 uh, really living with each other. You find out that, you

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.850
 know, like, um, maybe two people. I need more time to grow together

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.690
 instead of just, uh, delving into the relationship. You need to become

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.520
 a boyfriend and girlfriend first and way had to tackle some of that.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.350
 We tried again after I was started going to college. You know,

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.190
 that's ah, house with three bedrooms and, um, trying to get her a job

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.020
 and then you start toe, see that it's being married is one of the

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.850
 most important decision that you make in your life. And I think I would

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.690
 have benefit benefited from thinking about who I was getting together

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.520
 with.
