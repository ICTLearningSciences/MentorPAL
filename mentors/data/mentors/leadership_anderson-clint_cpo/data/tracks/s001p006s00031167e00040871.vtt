00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.650
when I was when I was a kid. I want Thio do something completely different

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.460
 than what I'm doing right now. I remember my grandmother had this

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.260
 piano that I used to play, and after my keys, my hands went on the

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.060
 keys and I started listening to music. I knew I was gonna at least

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.860
 give it being a musician, a shot. And then I used to live with my mother

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.670
 and she used to draw all the time. And so, after drawing my first

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.470
 few cricketers, I said, You know what? I'm an artist. And I think

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.270
 that really stuck with me the whole entire time that I was a kid when

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.070
 I was in middle school, I used to live in Germany and, uh, I was

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.880
 going to a German school and I didn't speak German at all. And then,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.680
 um, we had to learn French while I was in Germany. So I was learning

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.480
 French in German, and I was translating the both at home so that

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.280
 I knew I was gonna be, um, an international relations this guy. But

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.090
 none of that worked out. Eventually, I became an electrician's an engineer,

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.890
 and right now I'm a computer science scientists. So
