00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.020
I've been influenced by so many people throughout my naval career. It's

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.190
 not just one but several dozen who have give me leadership opportunities

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.360
 who have provided feedback on how I'm treated, how I'm treating

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.530
 my people, how I'm treating my career. But I think the the most influential

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.710
 person would be some of the friends that I've had, uh, coming

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.880
 through coming through a school and onward to my next ship. I have

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.050
 one particular friend. Uh, he went through the whole entire, um,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.220
 to your school with me, and I went to the my first ship, USS John C.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.390
 Stennis, And you followed behind me because I was there and all of

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.560
 the conversations that we had about what we're gonna do with our career

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.730
 where we're gonna go afterwards. What school we're gonna go to.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.900
 You know, they were all influenced by bouncing off of each other. We

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.080
 eventually, like, uh, both switched over the computer science. We

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.250
 both eventually, like a even went to the same community college afterwards.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.420
 So I think, uh, he gave me some really influential words toe

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.590
 work with while I was going through my naval career.
