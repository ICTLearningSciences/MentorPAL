00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.610
one of the problems that I found when I was doing undergrad is that I'd

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.370
 always, um, study. And then as soon as word got out or school got

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.130
 out, then I immediately go home and try to do my homework there. Sometimes

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.890
 you would find in the library sometimes you'd see me hanging

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.650
 out in groups and and with friends. But for the most part, I tried to

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.410
 do work at home. Um, I learned a lot, but I found it Mawr productive

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.170
 to do things. Um, the way that I did it in the Navy when I was going

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.930
 through the nuclear nuclear propulsion school. Um, there you're

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.690
 not allowed to take any books home with you. You have your dormitory,

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.460
 but because the books are confidential, you tend a study while you're

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.220
 there and because we didn't have ah, access toe laptops there, um,

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.980
 it was straight studying You just open your book and you read and

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.740
 you do your homework and there's nothing else you take a snack or something

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.500
 like that. So I'm trying to get back to that. So even though

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.260
 now I, um, I am allowed to bring the books home at the Naval Postgraduate

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.020
 School. I tend to stay there until the library closes it at

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.780
 8 p.m. And then I come home. And then at that point that I'm free. Then

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.540
 I try not to study it all.
