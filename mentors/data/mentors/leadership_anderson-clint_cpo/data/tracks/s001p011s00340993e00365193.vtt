WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.000
So as ah, reserve electrician's mate Chief, I recently went to the USS

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.160
 Blue Ridge. I was in the electrical department and I was in charge

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.310
 of this of a group of maybe I'm 15 electrician's who we were going through

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.470
 this really intense program. It's called unserved, and they hadn't

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.620
 been in chief there in the unit for a long time. So basically

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.770
 the, uh, second class in the first class classes that were there, they

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.930
 were actually running the unit. And to tell the truth, without a

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.080
 chief there, it had gotten a little out of hand. Um, there's a lot of

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.230
 gun decking going on. There's a lot of gun decking is when you say

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.390
 that you're supposed to do with some work, but you actually don't do

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.540
 it or you don't do it correctly or you don't do it completely. Um,

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.700
 there had been, uh, I guess lots of lots of team members like leaving

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.850
 throughout the day and then coming back later on, and you don't really

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.000
 know where they are, you know, chances are they could have been

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.160
 in Iraq. They could have been just walking around the ship or on the

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.310
 flight deck you know, not really working, You know, their mind and

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.470
 things like that going on. And they hadn't been corrected for a long

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.620
 time for for many months. You know, there's only one officer in the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.770
 unit, and she couldn't really look at the whole entire unit. So when

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.930
 I once I came there, um, I have to correct those things. And so

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.080
 one of the things that I wanted to do was say, Well, we should write

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.230
 down all the things that we're gonna be doing with little boxes and

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.390
 and once they get complete, then we check the boxes off. And they were

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.540
 very adamant against that. At least the the first class and second

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.700
 class leadership that was there. Um, that's because that's kind of

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.850
 like going into their field. It's like, well, you know, micromanaging.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.000
 But it's not micromanaging, you know, like I I I've done the same

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.160
 at my university. I've done the same with all of the other units

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.310
 that I've been with, you know, so and I think it really works. It really

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.470
 helps the leadership know exactly what's going to be accomplished.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.620
 Tells a unit what we're expecting of them, and it allows us to keep

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.770
 track throughout the rest of the day. So I was pretty adamant about

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.930
 wanting to do that. And, um, the first class and second class is

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.080
 did not want to do that, just like we'll get it done at our own pace.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.230
 Don't worry about it. New Chief. So that was Ah, point of conflict.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.390
 Um, yeah. It was, uh, strong words there, and eventually it I had

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.540
 to go into the friend zone and try toe work with them as a team rather

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.700
 than this, you know, super strict, chief to get it done and eventually

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.850
 was done my way. But it didn't come without a price.
