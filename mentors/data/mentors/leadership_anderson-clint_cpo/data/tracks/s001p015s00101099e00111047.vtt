When you're on a navy base, almost all of the major items are covered.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.760
 Um, between the any X, the navy exchange and the commissary. The commissary

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.720
 is really cheap, and it has most of the main foods. The any

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.680
 X has a range of, uh, cheaper clothes. Thio more expensive clothes,

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.630
 but they're not going. Thio tend to have local items. So, for instance,

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.590
 when you're in Japan, um, all of the delicious items, like a yakitori

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.550

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.460
 the newest Jordans or a necks pensive skateboard aren't gonna be,

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.420
 um, at the at the base. Uh, the index and the commissary has the basic

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.370

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.330
