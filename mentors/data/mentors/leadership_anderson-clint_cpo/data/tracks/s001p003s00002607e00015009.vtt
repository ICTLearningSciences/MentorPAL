00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.670
a statement that you hear over and over as you become a leader in the

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.490
 Navy is you have to know your people. I think that that's, ah, great

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.310
 quality to have. But you also have to pair it with listening. You have

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.130
 to listen to your people. So I I know that there are many leaders,

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.950
 um that have people come in. And then the leader just yelled at them

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.760
 and screams of them and says, You should do this and you should

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.580
 do that and then seems the way. So, um, there's a time for that. But

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.400
 for the most part, everyone has some kind of story. Nobody's out there

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.220
 trying to be evil. No one is out there trying to do the wrong thing

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.040
 for for the most part. So listen to their story, Um, and also be

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.860
 empathetic. So even if they were wrong, you should know, especially

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.680
 if they're young sailors. They didn't grow up the same way that you

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.500
 did. Um, yes, of course they can be treat out, but it's more important

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.320
 for them to understand why you're telling them to to do things a

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.140
 certain way and to get them on board What you don't want to do is instruct

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.960
 them. They know the right way, but then they leave, not wanting

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.770
 to do the right way. You have to make sure that your words come

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.590
 out so that hey, you know what? We're a team. You did it wrong. You

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.410
 understand that? You did it wrong. You're gonna be a leader for other

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.230
 people. So you have to do it this right way and you have to go. You

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.050
 have tow, have them leave saying you know what? Um, he was right.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.870
 And let's do it the right way from now on.
