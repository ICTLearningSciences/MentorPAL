00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.950
Well, hopefully your separation is done on honorable terms. Now, assuming

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.040
 that you don't get discharged for, you know, like some kind of violation,

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.140
 then there to pass that you can go either. You separate completely.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.240
 Um, yes, but let's say you do four years. You still have four

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.330
 more years to do your entire service. But those last four years,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.430
 a kind of invisible. They just want you to be around in case there's

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.530
 a war or something like that. But for the most part, if you finish

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.620
 your active duty tour, uh, you still have a role to play in the Navy

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.720
 because you'll always be a veteran until the day that you die. So

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.820
 you take that on, you have to make sure that you always, um, upstanding.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.910
 You don't wanna be involved in crime. You don't wanna be, uh, you

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.010
 don't wanna do anything that's gonna cause disgrace on the Navy,

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.110
 because you could be like 73 years old. If you do something wrong, guess

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.200
 what's going to be on that report. They're going to say he was

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.300
 a prior military servicemen or she was a prior military servicemen.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.400
 And you don't want to cause that disgrace. So, um, you get out and just

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.490
 make sure that you maintain that military bearing from that point

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.590
 on, Otherwise you could be like me. I'm in the Navy reserves and I

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.690
 still continue that Navy tradition just in a minimized capacity. I

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.780
 still go on. I still put things uniform. I still, um, serve on some

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.880
 kind of ship or some kind of shipyard every year, um, in a fully naval

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.980
 capacity. But otherwise I just take advantage of my educational benefits,

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.070
 and I still make sure that I'm always have that military mindset

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.170
 with everything that I do.
