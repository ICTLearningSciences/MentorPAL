00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.130
the most common crime that I see. Um, not so much in the nuclear field,

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.420
 because we were, you know, smacked on a hand about that. But ever

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.700
 since I became a reservist and going forward, um, in electrical side

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.990
 not to put them on blast. But I Honestly, I just see more. See it more

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.270
 common is negligence. It's when your gun decking gun decking means

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.560
 that you have, like, some some task that you're supposed to do and

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.840
 like, let's say it's you're supposed to look at all the fire hydrants

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.120
 and make sure that, um, they're they're cleaned and you're supposed

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.410
 to, right? Yeah, sure. Like like I actually looked at it and it

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.690
 could be many of them, you know, it could be 100 of them. Um, some of

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.980
 them are hard to find or some of them, Uh, maybe you're just lazy

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.260
 that day, and you can kind of, like, sign sign it off as being complete.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.540
 You'll get it on the next round. And that does happen. Um, as a

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.830
 chief, you just have to make sure that you spot check these things

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.110
 and and there's a whole pro program about that. Where where leaders

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.400
 Ah, look at random things and make sure that, you know, like, um, everything

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.680
 is being done to completion, but they still find them. Um,

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.970
 those people still get in trouble, but that's the number one thing that

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.250
 you have to be aware of as a leader.
