00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.940
for the longest time. Especially after we, um we were divorced. I did

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.020
 try to keep some contact, but I I did eventually realized that that

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.110
 might not be the best way to go forward. Um, she was trying to make

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.190
 her life. I understand that, like her new husband was was very, um,

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.280
 maybe jealous of me. Or we had some kind of conflict. And to keep that

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.360
 relationship going knowing that I was, uh, involving stress in your

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.450
 life. It just didn't seem wise to me, because there there are other

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.530
 people out there, and sometimes you just have to know window, um,

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.620
 cut it off and start fresh.
