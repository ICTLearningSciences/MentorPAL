00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.350
This is one one item of concern that really affect all work centers. Um,

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.840
 especially when you've been out there for see when people know each

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.340
 other and for for a long time. And, uh, you really talked about a

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.840
 lot of things. Um, there's not really much you can say to kind of increase

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.330
 the morale except for talking about the goals about the future.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.830
 About like, um, once you're gonna pull in, What's gonna happen?

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.320
 Um, generally, you try to keep things light. You try to keep things

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.820
 fun. Um, but it's it's really hard. Thio do when, uh, they've already

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.320
 had that that fun exciting, you know, goal oriented thing the first

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.810
 month of deployment. What about the third month? What about the fifth

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.310
 month? Right. So in that case, uh, it's one of the goals of leader

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.810
 toe tryto get their hopes up any way possible. I found that, you

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.300
 know, like, food is a really big motive. Uh, incentivize er motivator.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.800
 Um, maybe time off is another one thes air. Things that you know

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.300
 are beyond words. You actually give them something physical tangible

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.790
 that they can actually say. Yeah, you know, let's get our hopes up.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.290
 Let's get our let's keep our hopes alive. And, um, they're gonna be

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.780
 lots of times that what? You have to work all day and you're gonna

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.280
 be like that for the whole entire week. Um, of course, you gotta talk

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.780
 about what's gonna happen afterwards, but during in the middle of

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.270
 it on the second day, that is happening on the third day, that's happening.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.770
 Like I said, just keep it light and hope for the best.
