00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.850
I'll go with the second most important step, which is to know the material,

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.860
 to understand what it is you're talking about. And you might ask

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.860
 Well, how can that be? Number two on the list? Uh, the first thing

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.860
 that you, uh, that supersedes that is to know who to ask and where

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.870
 to get your material from. You don't have to memorize things. Uh, there's

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.870
 so many instructions, so many things that change on a day to

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.870
 day basis, it would be impossible. You make yourself go crazy, but you

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.870
 have tow have your google at your side. Um, it's not Google, but

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.880
 you have to know where to get things from. So down in, um, I t you have

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.880
 to know the person to talk to going to this website, you know, that's

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.880
 where the instruction is. As long as you have those materials.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.890
 Uh, then you can focus on other things like memorizing things and,

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.890
 um, putting, putting it out
