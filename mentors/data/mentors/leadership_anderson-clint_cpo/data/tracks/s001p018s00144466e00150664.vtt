00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.250
I define success as having a challenging goal put before you that takes,

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.640
 you know, either a small amount of time or a large amount of time.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.040
 But, um, it's not easy. You actually have toe, you know, like, challenge

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.430
 yourself to achieve that goal. And once you do, then, um, you

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.830
 know, that's your success.
