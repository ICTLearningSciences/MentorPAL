00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.720
I think the main benefits that, uh, people don't take advantage of if

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.600
 they're in the military. Um, number one. While you're active duty, you

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.470
 should definitely go to college. And you should definitely start,

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.350
 Um, um, putting money in stocks and there are people out there that

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.220
 can give you the tools for that after you get out of the service. I

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.100
 heard that, Um, yeah, only a small portion of people take advantage

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.970
 of their educational benefits. Many people who like toe give it thio

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.840
 their their family members just because they don't use it or they

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.720
 just let it disappear. Um, I think there's some, uh, law in Congress

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.590
 that allows you to have it indefinitely, which is really good. But

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.470
 even though you have it, um, and you don't use it, um, that's that's,

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.340
 I think, a shame that more people should take advantage off
