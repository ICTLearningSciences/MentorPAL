00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.720
when you're in the regular Navy active duty service, then you're not expected

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.590
 to travel too much except for when you're on deployment. Now

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.460
 that I'm in the Navy reserves, they expect me to actually go outside

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.330
 of my, um, my command every single year. So we have these things called

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.200
 annual trainings and being in the surge main unit, we actually

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.070
 go toe five different places. We could go toe Hawaii or Norfolk or

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.940
 New Hampshire, Japan, Um, and, uh, other small places as well. So for

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.810
 the most part, they really want you to go toe one place so you can

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.680
 know the people and get to know your job Well, but as the chief, I

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.550
 decided to go toe all of those places because, hey, why not? You know,

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.420
 it's not gonna hurt anything. And I don't actually want to know where

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.290
 my people are and what they're doing, eh? So that gives me an opportunity

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.160
 to say I know what all these shipyards are like. I know exactly

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.030
 where you're going, and I know those people. So, um, I've had

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.900
 a chance to travel a lot in the Navy reserves
