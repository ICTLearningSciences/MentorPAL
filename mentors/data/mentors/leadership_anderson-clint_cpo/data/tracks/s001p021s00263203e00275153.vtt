00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.640
sexual assault can happen anywhere. And as a chief, you have to be aware

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.420
 of some really isolated events, Um, that have a higher risk of having

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.210
 sexual assault. Thes could include working in, um, you know, like

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.990
 in the far reaches of the ship. Maybe they're down in the build together.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.780
 Maybe two people are up on the vulture's row together. Um,

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.560
 make sure that, um, there other people around so that they will be less

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.350
 apt to kind of get together. You wanna keep people separate? Um,

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.140
 another place, obviously. Wherever there's alcohol involved, you know,

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.920
 bars and clubs. So whenever you pull into port, I make sure toe

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.710
 describe to people Hey, you know what? We're all together on the same

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.490
 team. Make sure that you don't get too touchy feely out there even

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.280
 though, like you've been working with this person for the last, like,

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.060
 a few months together, and you might have stronger feelings. Um,

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.850
 for them, compared to strangers, make sure that they don't get out of

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.640
 hand once whenever you pull into ports. Also, like whenever we're

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.420
 doing counseling. As a supervisor, I make sure that I always have the

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.210
 door open. Um whenever I'm doing like one on one counseling, or that

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.990
 there is a third person in the room thin, the door could be shut.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.780
 But as long as there, um there is in a situation where it's one person's

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.560
 word versus another person's word, right? You want to try to avoid

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.350
 those situations as much as possible.
