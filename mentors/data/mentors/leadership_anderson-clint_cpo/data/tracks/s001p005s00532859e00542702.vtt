00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.720
the core team members that I found. And this is from the time that your

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.590
 third class all the way up to master chiefs that I've seen are the

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.460
 first class and the chief. That pairing combined is the backbone of

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.330
 the Navy. The lPO, it's his role as ah, as a chief in making is to

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.200
 talk to the whole entire unit, and the chief is the one that Davies

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.060
 out that information to the officers above, and he gets all the requirements.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.930
 What? There's the things that they're supposed to do. And

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.800
 it's kind of like an hour glass. And the chief is the thing on the top.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.670
 The sand at the top in the lpo is the sand at the bottom, you know,

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.540
 going going down. And that structure is so crucial. Um, where if

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.410
 you didn't have that, let's say you had a week chief or weak lpo. Um,

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.280
 then, um, yeah, it's all downhill. Downhill from there
