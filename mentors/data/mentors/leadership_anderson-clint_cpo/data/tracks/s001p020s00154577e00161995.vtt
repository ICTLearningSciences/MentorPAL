00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.650
so before someone tells me that they're suicidal, like if they say I'm

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.450
 suicidal, you direct them to the expert, the victim's advocate or the

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.240
 Stark. But before that time, if I think that they might say that

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.040
 the best thing to do is just to directly ask them. Hey, I've been noticing

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.840
 this. Are you having thoughts of suicide? If the answer is yes,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.640
 then, um, you stay in contact with them, you direct them to the V

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.430
 A. Uh, otherwise, they might just give you some of the main topics

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.230
 on their mind. And then your goal is just to listen. Listen, listen.
