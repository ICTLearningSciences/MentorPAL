If you want to earn the trust of your sailors, then of course you have

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.300
 to know what you're talking about. But no one's gonna expect you to

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.520
 be perfect. You just have to know how to find the material. So, for

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.740
 instance, someone says, Hey, I wanna have a really quality evaluation.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.960
 Can you help me? What's good is being able to explain all of it.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.190
 What's better? What's you know? Just as good is being able to fill

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.410
 out the first page and not knowing what Block 28 29 are saying, Hold

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.630
 on, coming back in an hour and saying, Oh, Block 20 is this Block 29.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.850
 Is this What's bad is saying, Oh, this is how you felt the first

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.080
 page and I don't know, But this is how you fill out block 28 29. Once

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.300
 they figure out that you don't know what you're talking about or they

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.520
 find out the correct answer and you were insistent that your answer

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.740
 was correct and you didn't give them any any any buffer for that,

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.970
 then they're gonna lose respect for you. So just make sure that you

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.190
 you always present yourself in an honest manner, and that's the best

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.410
 way
