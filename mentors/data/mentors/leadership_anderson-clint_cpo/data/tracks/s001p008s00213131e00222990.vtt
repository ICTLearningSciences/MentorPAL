00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.760
I think for people that have families I didn't understand at the time.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.660
 But I think it's very important now is that they have as much time

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.570
 with their families as possible. I think if you have a one year old

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.470
 kid, you should be there. You should be a physical presence. You should

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.380
 be there as much as possible. Um, and of course, you have Thio do

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.290
 deployments. You have to, like, go away for, like, six months. But

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.190
 the counter to that is that when you're home, you really need to be

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.100
 home as a single guy. I remember going overseas and then coming back.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.000
 And then, um, I still wanna work, uh, even longer once 1 1600 hit,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.910
 which meant, um, yeah, we have preventive maintenance. Let's get it

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.820
 done. Uh, yeah, we have to, like, do some kind of volunteer service.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.720
 Let's let's go ahead and do that like every single thing. Like I

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.630
 I didn't mind doing it, but I can completely see how someone with family

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.530
 needs toe, you know, make the snippet, you know, cut it off and

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.440
 choose to have that time dedicated to his family.
