I tend to find the annual training that we get on sexual assault prevention

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.350
 and response. Um, to be particularly valuable there a lot of definitions

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.600
 that aren't really common because we don't talk about them.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.850
 Um, so much that the training provides useful information on what

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.100
 is the V A What is the SAARC? What medical facilities do you have available

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.350
 to you? Um, should police be involved. Who is that? Who is

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.600
 in your chain of command, who you can talk to about? About that? All

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.850
 of these things, um, they're experts on there are people who are experts

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.100
 on it, and they could give much better information on it. And

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.350
 we should just have general knowledge on on how we can direct those

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.600
 people to go to it. So annual trainings are really good.
