00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.790
the ones you mainly want to focus on when you're talking about, like a

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.740
 choice that can really, um, disperse you out to many different places

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.680
 is number one, your family. If you have ah, wife or husband back

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.630
 home, um, it's gonna really uplift their career. You have to make sure

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.570
 that the thing that you're trying to do doesn't conflict with their

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.510
 own personal job. Um, with your kids, uh, they tend to be a little

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.460
 bit more flexible, but make sure that you're not disrupting their

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.400
 life too much. You know, they have a career that they're trying thio

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.350
 to make for themselves, you know, as far as like, their school and

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.290
 their grades. Maybe they don't wanna, like, go to another school just

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.230
 yet. Ah, lot of people. And you might think that that's trivial. But

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.180
 I found especially in Japan Ah, lot of people, like, stay at a certain

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.120
 place or extend their careers even longer based on their kids

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.060
 finishing school at a specific high school. Um and yeah. So make sure

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.010
 you put your family number one, uh number two. You want thio? Talk

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.950
 to people in the in your chain of command who might have experience

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.900
 with the place that you're going. One place I was considering going

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.840
 was, um, going to be thio the ship a submarine tender in Italy. Now

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.780
 I was told that it was gonna be in Guam, and I was prepared toe like,

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.730
 go to that place. But they actually, like, changed their spot and

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.670
 they were in Italy at the time, or it might have been vice versa. And

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.620
 so you think that you might be going toe certain ship, but in reality,

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.560
 you don't know what's actually happening. You don't know the mission

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.500
 of that ship. You don't know the type of job that you're doing

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.450
 on that ship. So the more information that you get from online from

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.390
 other people who have been on the ships from your supervisors, the

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.340
 better and more informed. Um um, answer that you could give yourself

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.280
 to make sure that it's the right decision for you
