00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.760
the right presence to have is for everyone to know. They're all, um do

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.660
 people have to understand that? You know what? Like I can't boss anyone

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.570
 around first class, petty officers have to understand. Hey, you

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.470
 know what? I was the second class, you know, a couple of months ago.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.380
 I don't have the right to boss them around, despite my my new title.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.280
 Chiefs have to understand. Hey, you know what? Even though I can

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.190
 boss people around, I don't want to, because they have to work for me.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.090
 And officers have to realize that Yes, I have a commission. And yes,

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.000
 I am your commissioned officer, but, um, ultimately, you guys are

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.910
 the ones doing the work, and I have to respect that. So if everyone

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.810
 knows their role and they don't abuse their rules, uh, that's the

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.720
 best way to get along. So how can you do that? Well, you have to make

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.620
 sure that each of those lines is very, very clear. Um, this is our

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.530
 officer. He's in charge of X y Z. Um, if he spends most of his time

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.430
 up in the office, you know, that's fine, but it should be clear to

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.340
 the unit that he is serving a really good role. You know, you can't

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.240
 just say, Oh, we have an officer and you never talk about him. You never

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.150
 talk about his rules, his responsibilities. You know that's not

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.060
 good for the team because they don't develop a reporter with him. So

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.960
 I have to say, as an officer, he has a different rule than you guys.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.870
 He's not down here working on equipment. He's not down here. Um,

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.770
 you know, cranking valves. I I want to say that because when I was coming

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.680
 up through the ranks, I didn't understand this difference. And

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.580
 I had a little resentment towards some of the officers that I saw was

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.490
 like, Hey, you know, we're down here sweating. We're busting our

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.390
 chops. How come I never see him? Um, now, as a chief, I make sure to

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.300
 explain that role toe the team toe to make sure that everyone understands

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.210
 everyone is working really hard. Um, and also explain the newest

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.110
 person you know, to the officer. Hey, you know what? Like even though

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.020
 he's just knew, you know, you have to realize, even though you

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.920
 don't see it, but he's down there in the build, getting his brand new

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.830
 uniformed dirty, you know, scrubbing and chipping and painting. You

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.730
 know, just to make sure that, you know, um, he's a valuable member

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:13.640
 of the team. So as long as everyone knows the value of each member

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.540
 of the team and it's very, very clear and there's no, uh, there's no

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.450
 crossing over, then that's how you build report with the team.
