00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.940
my marriage didn't work out for the same reason that I think it doesn't

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.030
 work out for a lot of, uh, new people in the Navy. Number one. I didn't

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.120
 really understand what the purpose of a marriage was for. Um,

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.210
 I I know there's a really cheesy thing to say, but, I mean, I have my

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.300
 father, my mother, and they divorced when I was young, so my mother

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.390
 kind of just took care of me. So my impression of what family waas

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.480
 was based on, uh, my mother, my sister who is 10 years older than me

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.570
 and her three kids. And it's a group of people that kind of take care

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.660
 of each other. Uh, maybe some people work and then they put money

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.750
 into the house. Maybe someone has a car, and then they drive people

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.840
 around. Um, maybe people laugh and joke, you know, you go to these

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.930
 places and that's what my impression of marriage waas Um, it's a group

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.030
 of people, um, dealing with family issues. But that's not the right

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.120
 reason to get married. I got married really young, um, in my eyes

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.210
 24 years old. And I found this, uh, this gorgeous model. Uh, she was

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.300
 my, um I lived with her for several years after I split up with my

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.390
 father. I was 18 years old. I bounced around from house to house,

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.480
 and eventually I moved in with my best friend. And, um, like, just staying

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.570
 with that whole entire family for years, One year, two years,

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.660
 uh, hanging out with the kids and the family and the, you know, going

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.750
 toe all these barbecues. And, you know, you develop a love for everyone

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.840
 in the house. You develop a love of strong connection. And I

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.930
 thought that that was, uh, a good way to make a family. However, when

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.020
 I eventually asked the like, my best friend at the time, she was my

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.110
 best friend to be married. I didn't think about her as you know what?

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.200
 Like I'm going to get old and die with this person. I was just thinking,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.290
 You know what? Like she supported me, I support her. Um, let's

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.380
 just do it. Um, but yeah, months go by and weeks go by and you don't

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.470
 develop the same type of love that should be in a marriage. Uh,

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.560
 you should wanna call back, for instance, I'm unemployment. Um, I should

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.650
 really wanna call back very often to the home. And I was just

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.740
 so involved with work. Um, really, if I would've looked around to my

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.830
 left and my right, There are many husbands who would stand in line

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.920
 for, like, four hours, five hours just to call back to their to their

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.010
 wife. And that wasn't me. And I should have, you know, I should have

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.100
 actually, like, been in more contact with my wife to make it less,

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.190
 and I didn't. When she's asking me for money, I would be thinking,

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.290
 Well, you know, like, I'm the one who joined the service and this money,

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.380
 it actually belongs to me. You know, it's It's my cash. I'm working

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.470
 for this, you know, And that's actually the wrong way to think

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.560
 about it. You should think every single dollar that comes to me should

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.650
 be split around, you know? So I was very selfish at the time as

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.740
 well. Um, yeah, I could go on with a lot of the reasons that I'm I was

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.830
 a bad person to be a husband to at the time. Um, I think now, maybe

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.920
 I'm ready. Every single dollar and make should go to my kids in my

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.010
 family. Um, every single free time that I have each our free time

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.100
 that I have should go to my friends and family. And I just didn't think

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.190
 that at the time, um, she had her, um, her items of concern as well,

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.280
 you know, like, but I'm not her and yeah, it just didn't work out.
