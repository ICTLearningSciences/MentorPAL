00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.790
the biggest risk I've taken in my career would probably be when I chose

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.730
 to take the shipyard superintendent role in festival. Now, I have

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.670
 been a nuclear propulsion engineer for my entire career, Um, tears at

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.610
 school and then six years on an aircraft care. Um, once you stop becoming

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.560
 Anak, did you remember and you switch over from a nuke to a

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.500
 regular electrician's, Then you're dealing with things that you have

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.440
 never seen before and some of it's great. Um, I actually put armatures

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.380
 in for motor before I've never done that. I've actually, like dipped

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.320
 huge pieces of mechanics, uh, mechanical pieces. I've actually

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.260
 ran cables. I've taken out entire circuit breakers with civilians, you

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.200
 know, like all these things I've never seen before and and it really

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.140
 build your, um, build your experience. But the shipyards superintendent,

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.080
 though that's, um, after eight years of doing the reserve and

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.020
 doing electrical things, you know, things that I kind of knew about.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.970
 The shipyard superintendent was an entirely new role. That's when

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.910
 you actually have to get out of the propulsion plant and see every

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.850
 single thing that there is to know about the ship and multiple ships,

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.790
 ships I've never even seen before. Um, em cm's mine sweepers. Um,

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.730
 destroyers, uh, you actually have toe go up to the navigation room

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.670
 and understand what's going on there. You have to go to the the main

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.610
 deck and the quarterdeck and, uh, you know, like fixing walls and paint.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.550
 And, uh, like there's so many things that I had no idea about,

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.490
 and yet I had to learn at the time. And for shipyard superintendents,

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.430
 they don't really have a tutor in front of you. You actually have

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.380
 to, like, just hop in there and just start learning, you know, like

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.320
 asking people, What is this? What is that? You know, reading computer

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.260
 drawings and books. And it was it was pretty intense. But, you know,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.200
 you step up to the challenge and luckily you have a good support

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.140
 network there. I didn't know about that, but I didn't realize how how

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.080
 good it was. And you have successful in the job
