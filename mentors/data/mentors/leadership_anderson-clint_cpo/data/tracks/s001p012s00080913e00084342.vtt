00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.280
Whenever there's a high volume area, then guaranteed, you're gonna have

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.710
 to live off base. And, uh, you always want to keep things in mind.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.140
 How close is it? It has the right space. I knew some some person, like

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.570
 lived an hour outside of base just because, like, there was a big

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.990
 field for the kids and a nice school system and and they just took

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.420
 the hit and just made the made the long drive. But of course, it has

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.850
 to be within the stipulations. Um, there could be some rules about

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.280
 how far it could be a way. There could be some rules about, like, how

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.710
 much it costs. So, um, it's just gonna vary depending on where you're

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.140
 going to go.
