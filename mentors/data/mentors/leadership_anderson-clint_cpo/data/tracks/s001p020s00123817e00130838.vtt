If you're going to be in an environment that has, AH, strong military

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.480
 population, then one thing that most do commands give. Everyone is a

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.800
 car that has the victim's advocate hotline, and most people put it

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.110
 in their wallet. In this way you have a direct communication, Thio,

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.430
 um, somebody who's an expert in the field so that if somebody comes

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.740
 to you and they have that for suicidal thought, that you can call the

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.060
 hotline and then you're in constant connection with that expert.
