00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.980
if I could change something about my job, I would think the type of things

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.100
 that are requested from me. I would definitely want to expand that

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.230
 right now. As a zone electrician's chief. I mean, the most of the

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.350
 time I'm in the role of Y N. C s senior chief Yeoman, that does a

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.480
 lot of administration work. I make sure that all of my my sailors go

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.600
 to the places that they're supposed to for their annual training, that

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.730
 they have the words that they're supposed to get that I, um that

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.850
 they have the evaluations, um, back and back and forth that they're

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.980
 correct, that they're done correctly, um, that the people that are

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.100
 supposed thio be the EPS and the MPs and the piece, uh, that those are

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.230
 the rankings that we give that they're fairly distributed on. Uh,

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.350
 I'm glad I'm in that position, but I would also like to have other

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.480
 opportunities. Not just that and for the reserves, you know, because

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.610
 we we're not active duty. There are only limited roles that we can

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.730
 take. Um, for most of the people in Los Angeles, we go to this one building

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.860
 and all of the people in l. A. Go to that same building. Um,

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.980
 surge main has one single floor, and, you know, like there aren't that

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.110
 many jobs that we can take. Um, whereas if you were an active duty

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.230
 member as electrician's, there's a long list of jobs that you could

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.360
 take throughout the country that you could go toe Norfolk for this.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.480
 You goto Japan for, uh, to be a shipyard superintendent. You can,

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.610
 you know, be, uh, get in the chemistry if you want to. You can go back

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.730
 to an aircraft, care to be an electrician's. You know, there's,

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.860
 ah wide range of jobs that you can take, but being in the reserves,

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.980
 you know, it's very, very limited, so I prefer that to be extended.
