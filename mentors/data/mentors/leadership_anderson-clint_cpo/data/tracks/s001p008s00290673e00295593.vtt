WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.630
before you deploy, somebody should have already given you a list of items

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.420
 that you need to have ready the main ones being your uniforms. You

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.200
 know, once you have your uniforms, you can basically go anywhere

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.990
 and then everything else can come later. But it's the things that come

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.770
 later. Those are the things that make life good or bad in that place.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.560
 So, um, you might want to talk to somebody else who's actually

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.340
 done the deployment to the same place that you're going to or you can

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.130
 get in contact with someone who's already there to kind of get an

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.910
 idea about what else you need. Things like that could be, um, your personal

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.700
 items if you play video games if you have a TV. If you have,

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.480
 um, some cooking habits that that you want to be shipped over there,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.270
 um, there's a long list of items, um, that you can get help for either

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.050
 locally or from your new command.
