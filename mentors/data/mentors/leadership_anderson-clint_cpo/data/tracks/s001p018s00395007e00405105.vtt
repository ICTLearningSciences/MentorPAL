00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.660
when you're involved with someone who thinks that they're doing something.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.470
 Um, that's perfectly fine. And you want them to change, Um, there

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.280
 step that you could take the first one. Especially as a supervisor.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.100
 You go up to them, explain exactly what they're doing. That's wrong.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.910
 Um, you know, tap on the shoulder, hopefully in a friendly way.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.720
 Um, t try to change your mind if you see it re occur. That's when you

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.530
 have the direct counseling. Um, maybe it's another verbal counseling,

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.340
 but you make sure that, you know, they're saying they're seeing

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.150
 their seated in a chair and the third person is there, and, um, they

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.960
 know exactly what you said. Um, they know what they need to change.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.770
 Another type of counseling is a written counseling. You know, you put

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.590
 in the record, you say, Hey, you know what? Like now something's

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.400
 gonna happen if you do this, then I have it written down that these

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.210
 things are gonna change. Um, so yeah, just as the supervisor, make sure

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.020
 that the steps are included on that, they know exactly what they

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.830
 need to change
