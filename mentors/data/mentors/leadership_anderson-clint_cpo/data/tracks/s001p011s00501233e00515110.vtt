00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.800
currently, I would say that I don't really worry about my professional

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.750
 future. I only see things that is positive. Um, even if I got out of

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.700
 the military, uh, in my current form, I think I could be okay with

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.650
 that. When I was a first class, I think the chief told me, You know

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.600
 what? I'm a chief, and you know, I'll probably retire the chief, and

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.550
 I'm comfortable with that. And I didn't quite under understand it

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.510
 at the time. I said, Hey, you know, you should always try toe push forward,

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.460
 push ahead. You know, like, there's so many things that you

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.410
 could do, you know? But, um, now that I'm a chief, I kind of see you

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.360
 know his point. You're doing something really productive. You definitely

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.310
 see your place in the military community as being valuable. And

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.260
 you've had a long history of it. Uh, there's that. That's absolutely

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.210
 honorable. Um, so now that I'm not worried about being so strict

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.160
 about that early promote being so strict about, um always trying to

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.110
 get the highest quality job that I could get being the senior enlisted

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.060
 adviser, or being the command master chief or if those things are

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.010
 out of my mind Thin those air, Just goals. Now, I'm not worried about

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.960
 it. I I just feel that those I can put forth the effort that it takes

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.920
 to get there. And if someone gets chosen over me, you know, I I

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.870
 clap my hands and say good on him. Um, tryto be like him as much as

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.820
 possible. And if I'm not, then I'm not gonna beat myself up over it.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.770
 There's so many other opportunities out there a Sfar as family and

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.720
 friends and my civilian promotion that you know what? Like it's just

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.670
 one small piece. My military career is just one small piece of a really

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.620
 big, huge and enjoyable life puzzle that I'm trying to fill.
