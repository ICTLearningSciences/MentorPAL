Whenever I find that there's an increase in tempo. To tell you the truth,

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.220
 you just go into auto mode before you know it. Like it's six o'clock

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.400
 in the morning and, uh, you eat breakfast. You think you eat breakfast

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.590
 and there could be, Ah, dinner in there, but all of a sudden

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.770
 you're in Iraq about toe knock out and sleep So some people don't really

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.960
 like that, that extra sweaty running work. But for me, like like

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.140
 that just made the day go by a lot by a lot quicker. And, um, you

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.330
 know, if you're doing interesting work, So, for instance, like, let's

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.510
 say, there's, ah, a casualty control procedure. Um, you're down in

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.700
 the plants and then the reactor scram. Then all of a sudden, you have

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.880
 to, like, go to your post and you know, turns from switches and

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.070
 call into the watch up through this and you have tow, you know, like,

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.250
 uh, put on your PPE to go fight a fire, you know, then those can actually

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.440
 be kind of kind of exciting, and you actually look forward to

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.620
 those those high temple times
