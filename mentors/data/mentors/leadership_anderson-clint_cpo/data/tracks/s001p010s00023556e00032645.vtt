If you're trying to get an award, unless it's the voluntary A service

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.120
 medal, then maybe you're thinking about it the wrong way. There are

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.750
 many people who actually do their job, and they try to do it really

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.390
 well. And then they want an award for it later on. And I think that's

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.020
 the wrong way to go about it. Basically, if you do your job, you do

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.660
 what you're told and you do it inefficient, fast manner. Then words

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.290
 gonna come. Um, sometimes there are unexpected, like the last name

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.930
 that I got. You know, it was very unexpected, but I could see why they

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.560
 gave it to me, because I did something very difficult in a really

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.200
 fast way. Um, but other awards, uh, they they come just from being

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.830
 on the team, and the leadership generally Davies it out. So if you

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.470
 don't get an award and you think that you should get award, I say you

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.100
 just bide your time. And as long as people know you as someone who's

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.740
 dependable, whose independent, then you get an award
