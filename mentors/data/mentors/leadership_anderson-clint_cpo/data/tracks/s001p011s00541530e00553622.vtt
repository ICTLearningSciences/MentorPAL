00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.110
My biggest weakness used to be the fact that I always wanted to do things

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.370
 myself. I thought it was ownership when I was giving a task and

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.630
 said, Hey, you know what? You have these five people go ahead and get

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.890
 this done. Or maybe just you yourself, go ahead and get this done.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.140
 And I wouldn't want to ask people how to do things I was very, very

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.400
 interested in, You know, not only getting the credit for it, but also

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.660
 learning about the thing that I'm trying thio to fix or, you know,

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.920
 operating as my with my team, Um, to make sure that like it's it's

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.180
 a goal that we ourselves completed. And even though there is some justification

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.440
 to that, that might be the wrong way to go. Um, if there's

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.700
 something that you don't know about rather than spend half an hour

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.960
 or two hours or even longer to try to figure this out myself just

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.220
 because I'm so stuck on the ownership portion, uh, what I've learned

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.480
 as a chief is you know what we're about. Speed here is well, so you

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.730
 have to, like, turn around, walk across the room, say, Hey, Have you

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.990
 ever experienced this? Get it in a few seconds and then go across

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.250
 and and keep it flowing. So I think about I'm a lot more efficient

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.510
 assed faras, um, asking questions when I don't have the immediate answer.
