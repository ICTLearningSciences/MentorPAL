00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.830
for me. It was really confusing when I joined. I didn't know anything

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.800
 about engineering or electron ICS. When I first came in, it took me

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.780
 the longest time to figure out what a ground was. Everyone kept saying

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.750
 it was the Earth that it was like dirt. You know, I didn't understand

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.730
 how it like, uh, match with electrical work. Um, a couple years

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.710
 in after hearing the same things over and over and over, you start

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.680
 to get good at it a couple years after that. Then you start to become

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.660
 a master at it. Um, a few years after that, then you're in the position

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.630
 that you can actually teach. It s so it's got gotten easier the

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.610
 longer that I've been in, just like with any other job.
