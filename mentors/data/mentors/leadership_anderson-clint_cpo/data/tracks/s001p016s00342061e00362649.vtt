00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.050
getting into a different field is something that I wish I would have known

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.240
 Maura about before I joined the, uh, field that I went in. I'm

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.440
 happy with being electrician's, but I did think coming in that you did

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.630
 have more opportunity to do different things. I thought maybe one

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.830
 day I could be in Germany doing X and another time being in the bottom

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.030
 of Africa. Doing why, um, as an electrician's, you know, I thought,

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.220
 Okay, well, sure, I'll be, um, taking voltage on these pumps. But

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.420
 I thought it could, You know, every place has electrician's, uh jobs

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.610
 associated with it, so I thought I could be associated with any of

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.810
 them. But that's actually not true. Um, for me, we have the submarines

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.010
 that we could go to and the aircraft carriers that we could go

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.200
 to, and those are the main places. You have a little bit more freedom

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.400
 when you're talking about the short commands that you could go to,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.590
 um, because we don't just want you always focus on these three ships

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.790
 all the time, so it's kind of like it's not a vacation, but it's more

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.990
 like a different work environment. so that we're not, like, so focused

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.180
 on just electrical things. But those short commands are few and

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.380
 far between hope for the majority of your work, you're expected to

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.570
 kind of, like fall within the field. If you're an officer, then you

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.770
 have a lot more choices. You can do some kind of lateral transfers,

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.970
 but as far as the enlisted side, you're mainly stuck with the field

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.160
 that you're, uh, that you've been trained to do. Now. If you wanted

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.360
 to do something else, you could force yourself into it. So, for instance,

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.550
 you could go to several schools, Um, a songs. You have your

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.750
 main career set. You know, I'm electrician's. I did. I went to electrical

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.950
 schools. I could also learn, Let's say, for instance, I'm, um

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.140
 I could go to a chemical school where if I learned that that rate and

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.340
 that school and those those tools, then I can start doing those jobs.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.530
 It's not a lot more, but it is something toe. If you're If you don't

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.730
 wanna keep doing your same job
