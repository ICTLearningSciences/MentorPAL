WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.800
whenever you work with a team. First of all, you have to know your team.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.750
 And once you know how they interact with each other, uh, you're bound

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.700
 to find some kind of dissension among these peoples. Um, they have

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.640
 lots of time together outside of work. Um, they might see each other

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.590
 at bars. Some of them might be dating other people that might have

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.540
 family problems. And those small problems can actually filter in

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.490
 into the unit now. Generally, there's not so much of a problem with

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.440
 that. That's how come you have, like people high fiving and people

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.390
 joking around and people like, uh, tapping each other. You want that

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.340
 kind of familial bond? But, um, if there is a problem, for instance,

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.280
 like, let's say, two people are dating and then they break up, then

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.230
 they're not gonna wanna work with each other or they're gonna work

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.180
 with each other bad. And for the most part, uh, it tends to go away.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.130
 But if you don't take care of it, it can grow to be really, really,

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.080
 really big problem. Um, people's lives on the line. And if you have

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.030
 somebody that doesn't want to go down and check on someone when they're

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.970
 supposed to, or if you have someone that says like, hey, argument

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.920
 with this personal yesterday and I'm going to give him a bad recommendation,

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.870
 things like that that could get really, uh, out of hand

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.820
 pretty fast.
