00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.470
my home life was very varied. You could say, um, I grew up with so many

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.100
 different people with my grandmother from my mother's side and my

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.720
 grandmother from my father's side, and my mom and my dad and I would

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.350
 split those four places all over the place. Um, sometimes in Alabama,

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.970
 which was, um, all black, which it was in an all black community.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.600
 Um, e didn't really get along with the kids. You can tell that my speech

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.220
 is very, very proper. And there they have ah, very Southern, um,

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.850
 southern heritage. And it kind of clashed. I didn't make fun of a

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.470
 lot. Um, maybe where you from? You know, you don't speak like us. So,

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.100
 um, the regular building that everybody gets, um, moving up to Michigan.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.720
 I stayed with my my mother, and, uh, that was mawr. That was

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.350
 more of an urban feel to it, but they we didn't grow up very rich at

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.970
 that time. You know, there were mice in their home. There was, um,

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.600
 drugs. I remember, you know, prostitutes in the house. So I didn't

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.220
 really try to stay home so much, but I really had a good relationship

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.850
 with my mom and my sister, who cared for me a lot. Um, later on around

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.470
 high school, high school time I lived, started living with my father,

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.100
 and it was just him. He didn't really, uh, care too much for

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.720
 me at the time. He had two jobs, and I could tell he was overworked.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.350
 Um, so basically, I stayed at my school and I stayed around. My friends,

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.970
 uh, that led to us not having a really good relationship. So I

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.600
 moved out of the house when I was 18. So my my childhood was pretty

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.220
 interesting, to say the least.
