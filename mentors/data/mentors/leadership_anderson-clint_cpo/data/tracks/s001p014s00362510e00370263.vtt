00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.260
the way that I find the deal best with the stress is toe let out your

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.670
 grievances. Um, you get all your people together, you have a chat about

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.090
 what just went on, whether it's something in the future, and you're

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.500
 not sure that they could do it correctly, whether something in the

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.910
 past that they maybe have gotten wrong or even just yourself, you

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.320
 know, like maybe you don't perform always perfectly. Maybe they have

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.730
 some grievance since grievances towards you. So you want to actually

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.140
 talk to them and say, Hey, you know what? Like wrong the same team

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.560
 here. Let's figure out how weaken move forward from now on successfully.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.970
 So just chatting and talking about is the best way to relieve

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.380
 stress.
