00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.290
my priorities changed a lot. Um, since I first joined the Navy when I

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.730
 first got in, I was always thinking about Well, how much am I going

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.160
 to get for school? Okay, put that inside. How much of my saving up for

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.600
 my time after the Navy. Um, if I were to join the Navy Reserve, put

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.040
 that off to the side. What kind of certifications can I can I get?

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.480
 What kind of training can I get that goes on my record that I can

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.910
 have for later on later on, You kind of realize you don't realize it's

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.350
 actually like training on you. And, um generally, most chiefs feel

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.790
 this way. All the things and all the activities that I've done are

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.230
 kind of they're not meaningless, but their second fiddle thio the type

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.660
 of work or the type of things that I could give to my sailors. So

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.100
 for me, my e is whenever somebody gets promoted, um, second to that

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.540
 is whenever anyone gets an award and although that's not necessarily

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.980
 on my record, I do get, you know, some kind of credit for that. Um,

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.410
 I just feel like it's more important kind of like handing down the

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.850
 torch to someone else, and I think that's that's one of the best things

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.290
 that you can have as you grew up in leadership.
