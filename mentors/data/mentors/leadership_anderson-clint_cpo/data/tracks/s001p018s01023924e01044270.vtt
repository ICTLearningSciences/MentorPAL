00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.420
sexual assault is one of those weird situations that you have to be very,

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.000
 very delicate with. If there's some contention, um, outside of sexual

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.570
 assault, let's say then, um, there could be situations that you

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.140
 don't want to, as especially as a chief. But you start sending people

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.710
 tow opposite, um, workstations. So whereas before you can send anybody

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.290
 with anyone, um, you to just choose two names, you go up there.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.860
 Um, fix this machine or YouTube. Go, go, go check the voltage. Uh,

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.430
 you you have to know who your people are and how they interact with

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.000
 each other, and you don't wanna push some buttons. Maybe it might

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.580
 take a few weeks to kind of like, um uh, decrease the intensity in the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.150
 in the unit. So in that case, you know, for temporarily you separate

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.720
 people, um, that might work with with sexual assault. Um, however,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.290
 when you're dealing with sexual assault, things can happen anywhere

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.870
 you know, especially with with a small unit. So in that case, you

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.440
 might want toe have other people aware of the tension between two people,

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.010
 so that, like whenever there's a new opportunity for the two

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.580
 of them, to be alone that as a as a group, as a team, you kind of like,

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.160
 make sure everybody is on the up and up. Um, for instance, like

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.730
 people could be sitting with each other at, um when they're eating lunch

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.300
 together. And that's ah, really prime opportunity for, um, words

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.870
 to be said, um, threats to be made right If people kind of know the

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.450
 other people in the unit. Um, so even as a supervisor, if you're not

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.020
 there, they can still kind of quell the situation. Um, it might get

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.590
 to a point, uh, that you have to send the person to another unit

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.160
 if if they can't interact with each other. Well, um, if it escalates

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.740
 too much, then you might want toe talk to the VA or the Stark, and

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.310
 they can kind of see where they were to go from there. The experts
