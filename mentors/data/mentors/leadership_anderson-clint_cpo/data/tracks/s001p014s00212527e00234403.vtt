00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.700
a chance that I recently took when I was on annual training was at the

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.560
 USS Blue Ridge. I was the chief, the new chief in charge of making

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.410
 sure that we successfully passed our insert requirement in service.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.270
 I mean, it's ah really comprehensive test that all the departments of

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.120
 the ship have to pass. And as a new chief, I was I was supposed Thio

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.980
 get all the electrician's to do all of the jobs that they were supposed

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.830
 to, and I think that they were very, very far behind. That's

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.690
 one of the reasons that I was called there and, uh, we didn't do too

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.540
 well. I think we scored in the mid range and the most of the ship.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.390
 They passed pretty pretty well, either green or, you know, like slightly

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.250
 under. But our electrical division was just so so in that. In that

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.100
 respect, I think that we were working really hard every single day.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.960
 Um, warning tonight. You know, uh, kind of directing some of the

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.810
 guys toe, go fix things and do preventive maintenance on things. However,

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.670
 we couldn't catch up from the like maybe year. That had been

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.520
 kind of like slowly keeping behind us. There were too many things to

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.380
 fix. Too many lights that we hadn't seen too many rooms that we didn't

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.230
 know where they were too many like bakers that we couldn't open

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.080
 once they were open, like inside. We have to, like, do some other things

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.940
 to make it work properly. And we couldn't catch up, Um, to the

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.790
 time, um, that insert was to be successful in that regard. Who did I

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.650
 talk to? You know, uh, that's the thing. You always have to have feedback

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.500
 to the people above you, your superiors, your devo, Um, even

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.360
 the commanding officer in this case, you know, I remember the commanding

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.210
 officer of the Blue Ridge was down with us down in the in the aft

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.070
 steering room. Um, making sure that the the I think it was some kind

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.920
 of valve that was supposed to be, um, that was affecting the engine

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.770
 room. He was there, you know, like turning a wrench with us. So

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.630
 as long as everyone up the chain knows exactly where you are and what

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.480
 your problems are than they're a little bit more forgiving for that,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.340
 it's when you try to hide things. And, you know, you say, like, Hey,

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.190
 I could do it. You know, I'm a single individual or I'm the leader

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.050
 of this crew, you know, And you don't feed the information back up

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.900
 the chain. That's when they start, um, being frustrated with you.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.760
 So a songs You have that chain that you keep informed, you good to go.
