00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.960
Well, my name is M C. Clint Anderson. Ian stands for electrician's mate.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.080
 I've been the Navy for about 20 years in the Navy Reserve right now.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.190
 Um, for the first six years of my naval career, I've been on lots

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.300
 of different tours. Aircraft care, USS John C. Stennis, start off

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.410
 with a nuclear power school. So, um, the first tour that I had was working

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.530
 in the nuclear engine room in the propulsion plants, fixing electrical

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.640
 lights, um, working with other people, trying toe repair pumps,

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.750
 repair valves, um, moving the throttles on this ship toe provide

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.860
 propulsion. I had a lot experience with that. Um, there's a lot of

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.980
 clean that went on, but for the most part, it was satisfactory tour

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.090
 that I spent in South Carolina in New York. Um, um, the most recent

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.200
 place was Washington. And after that, that initial six year tour actually

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.310
 extended for two more years to have a total of eight years,

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.430
 two years of school, six years on the ship, and then I actually got

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.540
 out. I didn't want to get out of the Navy. Um, completely actually started

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.650
 joining the Naval Reserve. And I've been in the Navy Reserve.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.770
 Um, for the last 10 years, for that whole 10 years, I've actually been

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.880
 in school, working on and off. But for the most part, I, um I got

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.990
 to see a lot more of the world through the Navy reserves than I did

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.100
 ever on the ship. They take me toe all the all the different states.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.220
 Washington, Hawaii, New York again. Norfolk, Virginia, San Diego.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.330
 Um, yeah. Every single year, actually. Do something with the Navy for

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.440
 about this summer. We go and we we go to a shipyard and we repair

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.550
 some things or they give us some kind of training. Um, outside of the

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.670
 navy, I've been in school, I've been in, um, I've been going to USC,

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.780
 and I got my masters there for computer science. Before that, I

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.890
 was an undergrad at UC Berkeley, and currently I'm at the Naval Postgraduate

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.000
 School in Monterey, California. So for the last 20 years, I've

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.120
 had a a wide range of experiences from, you know, touring overseas.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.230
 Um, the first time I joined the Navy was right after, um, 9 11 happened,

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.340
 So I was really involved with wars, and I got to see a lot

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.450
 of things that most people would never see. So I'd say that the Navy

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.570
 has been been pretty good, and I'm looking forward to my next tour.
