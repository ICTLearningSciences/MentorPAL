00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.920
the best way that you could help your team meet standards. At least for

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.980
 me. It was to lead by example when it was for fitness. I made sure

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.050
 that I was always, um, pushing people clapping them on, you know, being

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.110
 one of the top performers of my physical fitness assessment. Whether

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.180
 it's for awards, I made sure that, like I have some awards myself,

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.250
 I know what it takes to get awards. Aiken, tell people if you wanna

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.310
 get sailor recorder, you need X, Y and Z let me help you. I've

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.380
 also done X Y Z Um, here's here's my my resume. Here's my recommendations.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.440
 Um, go to some other people and get there is, you know, and give

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.510
 it to them. That's called leading by example when you have, ah,

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.580
 pristine example, or at least as close to what is possible. And then

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.640
 you filter that out to other people, um, for standards of, let's say,

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.710
 fixing some equipment, right? Um, if they don't know how to do it,

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.780
 then you lead by example. You are the one who goes down there and

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.840
 says, Hey, you know what you want through these things you bust out

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.910
 this tech manual and you you report to this person. Um, the worst thing

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.970
 that you could do is, uh, knowing that they don't know that they

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.040
 might not reach the standard. You still direct them from the office?

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.110
 It's like, Hey, go down there and and fix it. Once they come back

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.170
 with substandard work, you don't really have ah position Thio. Explain

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.240
 to them like, Hey, you know what? Like you were wrong in this case,

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.300
 if you weren't there or if you didn't show them what the right example

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.370
 was, then you're the one who is wrong.
