00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.840
so there are many different leadership styles. You could be you direct,

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.840
 you could be friendly. You could be sweet. You could be stern. I think

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.830
 if you wanted to. And all of those can have success. No doubt,

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.820
 especially it depends on the person. But for me, if whenever I wanted

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.810
 toe really build a connection with people you have thio get outside

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.810
 off the work environment and I mean, I mean it like this. You have

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.800
 to know about the people outside of the job that they're doing. It

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.790
 could be learning about their family. It could be knowing about their

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.780
 kids. It doesn't have to be super friendly. It doesn't say, Hey, you

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.780
 know what? Let's go drinking on a Saturday afternoon. But it should

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.770
 be saying, Hey, you know what? I care about you more than just my

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.760
 subordinate justice worker that I that I have, um, I care about your

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.750
 life to, um not just like your safety, but also your well being. Um,

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.750
 S o tell me about it and get to know me, get to know you and yeah,

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.740
 that's the best way to build trust
