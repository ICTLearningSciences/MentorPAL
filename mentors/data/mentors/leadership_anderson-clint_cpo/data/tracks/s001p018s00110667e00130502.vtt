WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.930
the sexual harassment can, uh, take form in a variety of different ways.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.010
 We have red blue. I'm sorry. Red, yellow and green lights red is,

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.090
 uh, agree. Just green is, um you know, you can get rid of those with,

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.170
 uh, stern and strict words. Yellow is somewhere in the middle and

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.260
 green, I think, happens fairly often. And the reason for, uh, slight

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.340
 sexual comments throughout the work days Because, especially on deployment,

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.420
 you know, you're with everyone all the time. Um, from sunup

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.500
 to sundown. Um, you have guys and girls and they have their emotions.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.580
 They have their feelings. And some people, actually, I think the

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.660
 military isn't is a wonderful place toe. Meet a spouse. There are many

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.740
 military couples. And without, like, talking to each other during

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.820
 work house, are you gonna get to know the other person? It's when

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.900
 you ah kind of go too far in trying to show your emotion to the other

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.980
 person. I'm allowed toe talk to anyone on this ship and say, Hey,

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.070
 you know what I think that's Ah, nice outfit that you have. And that's

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.150
 one way that you can start. Ah, communication. Um, once we get out

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.230
 of work, for instance. I see them outside. I could maybe get their

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.310
 number at work, and then we take it further outside of work. Um, if

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.390
 you're on deployment, you don't have that opportunity. Uh, everything

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.470
 that you do, you know, if you're gonna talk to them, it's going to

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.550
 be at work because you're at work for 24 hours per day. Uh, the most

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.630
 important part of the most important thing to remember is that it

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.710
 cannot exist on this ship. There is no dating. There is no getting

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.790
 together. There's no kissing and hugging on this ship at all. Um, so,

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.880
 yeah, you can get to know people. You can sit down, chat, talk, talk

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.960
 about the general quarters that happen, talk about like when we get

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.040
 off the ship, you know, like like let's continue this further. But

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.120
 on the ship, you know, just make sure that it's purely platonic and

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.200
 and that that will save you a lot of heartache in the future.
