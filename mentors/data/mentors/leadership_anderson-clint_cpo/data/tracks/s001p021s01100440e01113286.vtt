00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.060
the way that I tend to avoid bias is number one by giving constant feedback.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.270
 Um, a case in in point is, um, I'm supposed to give evaluations

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.490
 for, um, several people in the unit. Let's say they're 20 people.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.700
 Um, at the beginning of the cycle, um, I tell them exactly what I expect

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.910
 for them. Toe earn the wars that they're gonna get. Earn the marks

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.120
 that they're gonna get. Um, I make sure during the midterm counseling,

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.340
 I sit them down. I give them a sheet of paper that describes

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.550
 how generally, um, grade them. Um, maybe not always with the direct

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.760
 marks, but I tell them where their strengths are, where their weaknesses

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.970
 are and what I expect them to do. Um, in the next six months,

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.190
 to kind of increase their scores. Um, and especially during counseling,

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.400
 I, um, make sure that I put everyone's, um I put everybody on on

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.610
 an Excel sheet, and I have, like, all of the roles, like professional

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.820
 development leadership, um, can, uh, climate inequality. I put all

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.040
 of those down, and then I mark exactly based on what they wrote on

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.250
 the back of their evaluation, how they increased each of those scores

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.460
 and I go through everyone. I make sure that, like if I gave somebody

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.670
 a good score, that someone who did the same exact thing gets that

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.890
 same score, a zealous for the negatives. And then, um, I think that

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.100
 that's how I prevent bias in my own grading That goes the same for

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.310
 awards if I'm handing out awards or if I'm giving promotions.
