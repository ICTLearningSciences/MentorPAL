00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.160
college is one of the main reasons that I joined the military service.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.460
 And if you think that you're gonna have the naval, um, the naval profession

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.770
 be your your main career, then I would suggest going to college

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.080
 as soon as possible, even while you're in, preferably before, but,

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.380
 um, sometime, Um, after, uh, after you, after you join, based on

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.690
 some of the free education that you get on and try to become an officer.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.000
 If that's your thing, um, they have a longer career, spanned,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.300
 maybe upto 30 years. Um, yet I think a wider range of professions, Um,

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.610
 plus, maybe you joined the service when you were younger. You didn't

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.910
 really know what you wanted to do, and you might be in a profession

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.220
 that, um, you could enjoy. But you could also want experience, different

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.530
 things. I think officers have a much wider range of things

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.830
 that they can do. You can still do the same rate that you are that you're

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.140
 in. There are many nukes that continue to be nukes afterwards.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.450
 But if you're an officer, yeah, you have the chance toe, um goto many

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.750
 more places to be in a higher responsibility profession, I think

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.060
 eso you you consider? Um, Officer, if you were, if you had a degree

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.370
 during the time now, you could be like me, which is use the profession

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.670
 of the naval profession as a way to get your education. And in that

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.980
 case, I would say you go to school after you get out. Now, um, for

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.290
 me, I stayed in the Navy Reserve, and that really worked really, really

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.590
 good with with going to school. Um, I did my six years active.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.900
 I took a few classes online. Um, I think I had, like, three or four

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.200
 classes that that I was attempting, at least. And then at the end of

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.510
 eight years, um, after joining the Navy Reserve, I I was in school

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.820
 for full time, basically for the I guess the last, like, eight years

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.120
 or so. I did my undergrad and I did a master's. And I'm currently,

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.430
 um, still in the Navy Reserve and still getting my masters. And I think

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.740
 that freedom that you have without worrying about full time work,

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.040
 uh, is really beneficial, Especially if you want to do really good

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.350
 at your at your at your, um, class in your classes
