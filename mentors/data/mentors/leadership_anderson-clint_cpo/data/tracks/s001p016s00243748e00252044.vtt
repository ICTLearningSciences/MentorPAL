WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.760
you could have asked me about my interaction with other branches of service.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.660
 For me, the answer is I experienced ah, little bit off communication

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.570
 with some of the Marines, especially when we're on deployment.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.470
 Um, and every now and then I go up to some of the Air Force bases

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.380
 and occasional army bases. Uh, that's when I had actually see them

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.280
 and kind of realized, Hey, every place is not just the navy, but yeah,

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.190
 depending on what your rate is like, you interact with other people

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.090
 a lot more, especially if you're in the medical field. I think, you

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.000
 know, like all the services if your hospital Corman, but, yeah, other

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.900
 service, other branches of service to exist and we don't interact

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.810
 with them slightly.
