WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.280
when I was in active service. Um, you start off at South South Carolina.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.710
 We were going to school, and basically I had no responsibilities.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.150
 Just learn. Once I was at prototype in New York. Um, then you actually,

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.580
 like dealing with moving switches and turning knobs and trying

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.010
 to understand things, trying to change things. Um, after that, we went

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.440
 toe USS John C. Stennis, and that's when you became an operator,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.870
 but a new entry level operator. Um, by the time I left there, after

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.310
 three years, I was a senior level operator, and I was actually, um,

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.740
 doing lpo responsibilities for the rest of the rest of the crew. So

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.170
 you can see that basically, with each new city, I had a new level of

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.600
 responsibility and just turned out that way. It doesn't have to be

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.030
 that way, but for me, um, when I finally left after eight years of service

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.470
 and I, um, became ah, Naval Reservist, I was in the position

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.900
 toe to be a first class and a chief at that time, and my whole entire

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.330
 experience had kind of been leading up to that point
