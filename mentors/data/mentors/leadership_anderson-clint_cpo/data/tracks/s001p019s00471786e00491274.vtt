00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.450
This is ah, really complex question. It really depends on what you've

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.040
 done for your career, how broad it was and mainly what job you expect

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.640
 to have once your complete as an electrician's. Um, of course, I'm

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.230
 gonna have that, uh, eight years that I had and there's so many things

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.830
 that that go into it. There's the schooling that I had there the

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.420
 you know, grad level, um, classes that I took during my school. Um,

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.020
 there's the extra classes that I took while I was on my ship there.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.610
 The college classes that I took while I was on my ship. And toward

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.210
 the end of my career, I had all of that supervisory, um, supervisory

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.800
 roles that I could also put, um, saying that I had experience with.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.400
 So if I got a job as a nuclear operator at the end, all that years,

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.990
 all of those years would contribute to getting that, uh, that job.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.590
 I have eight years off doing that job. However, if I chose to change

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.180
 my career, which is exactly what I did then I don't have to throw all

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.780
 of those away, But I can't really, um, depend on the the nuclear

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.370
 aspects of it. I'm a computer scientist. I'm in the i t field, so they

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.970
 don't really care that I know how toe do, uh, how to change pumps

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.560
 or how toe check voltage that that doesn't really apply toe apply to

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.160
 that. But what they do care about is, um, the leadership roles that

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.750
 have had the fact that I'm a veteran the fact that I can actually

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.350
 teach myself the fact that I did two years off training in the in the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.940
 most difficult, um, things that you can imagine as an American. Um,

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.540
 all of that kind of gives me a bump up. Um, but yeah, you just have

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.130
 to make sure that it relates to the job that you're gonna get, um,

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.730
 once you get out
