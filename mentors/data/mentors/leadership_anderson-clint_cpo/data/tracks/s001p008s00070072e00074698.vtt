00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.060
I think I changed my life. Ah, lot. Ever since becoming a supervisor,

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.260
 I remember being a second class, um, getting done with the work. And

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.470
 you want the work to be done as quickly as possible because, you know

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.670
 that, um, soon you get done. That means that, like, come 1600 they're

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.880
 gonna let you off at that exact time. If you're ever, um, if your

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.080
 job ever needs a longer amount of time, then you know you're gonna

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.290
 just stay there longer, so it's better to get it done quicker than

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.490
 later. Um, as a supervisor, though, like, things are slightly different.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.700
 Of course, you want the work to be done, uh, immediately, but

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.900
 you see everything that's on your plate so you actually want to do to

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.110
 be most efficient with your time.
