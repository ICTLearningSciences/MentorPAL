00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.750
I've been in the Navy for 20 years, and I picked up many awards during

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.640
 that time. You generally get an award or a ribbon every two or three

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.540
 years, and these are the ones that I've received so far. They're labeled

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.440
 in order of precedence from the top to the bottom at the very

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.330
 top. I have, ah, Navy achievement mental now. And this is generally

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.230
 the highest award that most people most enlisted people get. I got

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.120
 this one for being a shipyard superintendent at my last command. Sassa

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.020
 Bill. Um, the shipyard was going through an intense availability

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.920
 at the time, and I did quality work there. On the next road down, you

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.810
 can see that I have meritorious unit commendation amok. And this is

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.710
 when I was on the USS John C. Stennis. The aircraft care and the whole

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.610
 entire ship received this award. So as long as you're part of the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.500
 team, you get that, uh, next over, we have a good conduct awards,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.400
 and as long as you're in the military and you don't have any infractions,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.290
 then you pick those up. Besides that, we have the, um, National

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.190
 Defense Service medal. You get this award for being in one of several

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.090
 wars, Uh, could be the Korean War, Vietnam War, Iraqi freedom or

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.980
 the Persian Gulf War. So I was in Iraqi freedom. The next road down,

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.880
 you can see that I have to global war on terrorism medals when it's

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.780
 for service, when it's for expeditionary. The expeditionary medal

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.670
 I got for being unemployment, fighting counterterrorism. The one after

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.570
 that we have the sea service deployment ribbon. And I was on a deployable

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.460
 unit USS John C. Stennis. So I got that one. The one down

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.360
 is things is the Navy and Marine Corps overseas service ribbon. So many

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.260
 reserves don't get this. But I was fortunate toe be able to go to

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.150
 Japan and then work accessible several times. And I got that one from

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.050
 doing that, Um, these air to marksmanship ribbons. One is for pistol.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.950
 One is for rifle. The pistol, uh, you shoot far away targets standing

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.840
 and kneeling and the rifle you also have toe lay flat. And you

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.740
 get that. I was also fortunate enough to pick up my warfare pins.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.630
 Um, we have the surface which is your main qualification, and then

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.530
 air and you pick these up by understanding what different types there

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.430
 are, what different payouts there are with different weapons systems.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.320
 They have things like that. It's pretty intense training about half

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.220
 year, but yeah, I was fortunate to get those.
