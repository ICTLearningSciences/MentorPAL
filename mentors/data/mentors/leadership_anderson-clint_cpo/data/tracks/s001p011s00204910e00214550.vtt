00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.880
the complainers are the ones that caused the problems. If you hear a person

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.910
 that says I hate the Navy, I don't like this place. I hate this

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.940
 ship. I hate my life. I hate blah, blah, blah. Um, whenever you hear

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.960
 the word hate, you know, you have to, like, pay a little bit more

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.990
 attention because, um, yeah, everyone has their own opinion, and that's

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.020
 fine. And maybe that that person wants to actually, like, just

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.050
 do it for six years and then take off. You know, more power to him.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.080
 As long as he's doing his job, that's fine. But what is the problem

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.110
 is that he's spreading that discontent within the unit. Right? Um, maybe

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.140
 there's there could be somebody who wants to make it a career,

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.160
 and this person is actually like putting his negativity on that person.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.190
 And, you know, I changed his career trajectory. Or maybe, um, like

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.220
 it's reducing the morale of the unit. So all the complainers you

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.250
 have to like, stop that as soon as possible.
