00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.950
Whenever you find out about the death of the ship you have toe, make sure

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.050
 that you're saying things the right way in the right mood in the

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.160
 right tone. Um, of course, the family needs to be, um, be contacted.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.260
 And they're they're the lines of communication for that, Um, but particularly

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.360
 for the ship, Uh, that person had friends. That person had

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.460
 close close contacts on the ship. And you have to make sure that,

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.570
 um, at that time, their well being is the most important thing. Um,

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.670
 the way you address the ship, you have to be a somber. You have to

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.770
 be in a somber mood. You have to make sure that, like, um, stay positive

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.870
 about their time on the ship. You never wanna speak poorly of someone

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.970
 who just passed away. Um, make sure that, like a we know that

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.080
 we always have a mission. You know, we have a mission, and that comes

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.180
 first so that you have to make sure that you can't really be dwelling

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.280
 on the death for such a long time. The people that need to get

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.380
 off the ship, you know, if if it comes to that, then they need to be,

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.480
 um, put off just to make sure that everyone else is safe. And the

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.590
 people that are on the that are still on the lines. You have to make

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.690
 sure that they could do their job effectively. Um, but keeping in mind

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.790
 like how that person died, make sure that that doesn't happen again.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.890
 Especially if it was an accident on the ship. If they were killed

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.000
 out in town or if something else happened out in town, maybe it was

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.100
 some kind of disease. Or maybe, um, you know, it's an accident with

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.200
 a car or something like that. Then whatever training needs to happen

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.300
 should happen for car things. Make sure that everyone's buckled

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.400
 up. Make sure you give training on, uh, reducing your speed. Um, ifit's

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.510
 accident, Let's say a fall. Make sure that, um, the local policies

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.610
 are in place. Um, so, yeah, I just respect the death and respect

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.710
 the people that knew that person
