00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.730
as a chief. If you've been, uh, in the unit a lot, you kind of know if

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.600
 the mood changes after there's been some kind of discrimination or

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.480
 assault or things that could really affect the unit, Um, you might notice

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.350
 a difference in the mood or the tone of the unit. And that might

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.230
 let you know that Hey, you know what? 20 minutes ago, there was probably

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.100
 a big argument. I found that a lot on my last ship. Um, sometimes

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.980
 I would go inside and everyone's eating pizza and kind of chatting

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.850
 and joking around. Another time I would go in and everyone's rocking

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.730
 in their chairs. Or it's just sitting down like staring at the

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.600
 walls and stuff. You know, something kind of happened eso If the mood

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.480
 changes, that's one. If you see a decrease in the quality of work,

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.350
 that's another one. Um, especially if a really good person who never

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.230
 has any problems starts handing and shoddy work. Then that's cause

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.100
 for you to say to sit them down and say, Hey, um, did something happen

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.980
 recently
