00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.000
unemployment. Your access toe communication tools, uh, kind of goes hand

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.150
 in hand with your role. I think the more supervisory you are, the

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.290
 more access you have If you're, uh, third class or maybe even a seaman,

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.440
 um, new to the command, then you might be waiting in longer lines.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.590
 Um, it also depends on when you're trying to access things. So if

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.740
 it's during the middle of the day, then yeah, during your lunch time,

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.880
 you might not even get access to the phone at all. So you have to,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.030
 like, how many people are there And there could be like that third

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.180
 person in line who just is intent on talking Thio, uh, their husband

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.330
 the whole entire time. So you have to take that into account. Um,

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.470
 however, if you tryto talk at night time, you know, it could be like

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.620
 2 a.m. Then, Yeah, you could be talking the whole entire time. Um,

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.770
 as faras Internet goes, uh, library tends to have some kind of station

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.920
 for you, and there's some kind of sign up list, so they're pretty

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.060
 good about, like, at least letting you access the Internet. But things

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.210
 change. It depends on which ship you are with ship you're on and

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.360
 what the structure is
