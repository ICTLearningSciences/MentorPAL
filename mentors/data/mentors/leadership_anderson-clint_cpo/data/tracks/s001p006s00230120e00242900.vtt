00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.470
for me, one of the main benefits that I found from being the Navy comes

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.090
 from. I mean, I walk down the street and I get so much respect for

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.710
 being a veteran for serving the country and considering what I've done

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.330
 and what I've seen other people in my in my rate and in my, um,

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.960
 service do I think that is justified as a civilian? I so most right.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.580
 I've been a student this whole entire time, and I have done some jobs.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.200
 I've worked for the for NASA. I've worked for Institute for Creative

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.820
 Technologies at USC. I've done I've seen what software engineers

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.440
 do, and, um, they get a lot of pay for, um, strenuous work, no doubt.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.060
 But there's no comparison for getting maybe paid half what? Your

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.680
 half. What your civilian counterparts get but doing ah lot more work

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.300
 for and most people in Navy don't Don't consider this. You could get

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.920
 paid more as you go askew. Go further in your career. But, um, most

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.540
 people in the Navy don't do this fourth salary. We do it for the

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.170
 type of work that we're doing, which is hard, strenuous. You know, young

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.790
 person you know, bottle physic, physical work. Um, that's serving

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.410
 the country. So I think that that's one of the main benefits that

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.030
 I got the fact the private get from being able to be one of the few

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.650
 people who can do that.
