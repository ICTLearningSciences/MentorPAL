The main thing that you have to learn as a new leader is the type of responsibility

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.020
 that you have versus what you used to have. So, for instance,

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.100
 um, working with your hands cleaning the Cellini to sell your

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.190
 expected to go out there and then twist it off and drink it off and

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.270
 put the new one in. And, um, as a leader, you have to get that same

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.360
 job done without actually doing it. It's kind of weird, I know, but

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.440
 your role is to tell someone else to do it. And I've seen a lot of

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.530
 leaders have that problem, especially people that that have the new

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.610
 position. So a second class becomes the first class. I'd actually have

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.690
 to go down there and tell them. Hey, you know what? Get off that

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.780
 pipe. Get off. That's Lenny to sell. Um, you have three other people

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.860
 here. They're not gonna learn by you actually doing it. We know that

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.950
 you can do it. You've done it thousands of times. Now it's your time

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.030
 to put the wrench in that person's hand and watch him do it. Um

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.120
 and then, yeah, after, after about a year or two, they finally get on

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.200
 board with that. And that's how you become the next rank. After
