00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.200
a restricted report is a situation where someone was violated, but they

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.560
 don't want the whole entire command to know about it. Which means

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.910
 that only a few people know are aware of it. Um, the V a, the Sark,

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.260
 the person, um, even even medical people if if they're in in that in

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.610
 that line and the commanding officer finds out that, um, something

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.970
 happened, but no names are given and the specifics aren't given and

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.320
 unrestricted and unrestricted report on the other hand, uh, it zone

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.670
 by a lot more people, you know, probably the police can be involved,

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.020
 and the commanding officer actually knows the exact situation. So more

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.380
 people are involved and you can actually follow criminal report

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.730
 based on an unrestricted report as opposed to the restrict the restricted

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.080
 report.
