00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.270
When you think of war, you actually think, Well, I actually thought of

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.680
 the soldiers that are on the ground with guns in their hand, looking

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.100
 over Hill, maybe pulling the trigger. Being in the Navy, I kind of

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.510
 saw the wide range of jobs that you that you have very few people actually

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.930
 are shooting and are being shot at, uh, especially for the Navy.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.340
 Um, they actually say that an aircraft care is one of the safest

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.760
 places to be. So you're out there in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.170
 Um, you have subs and destroyers around you protecting you. You

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.590
 have long range radar. Um, also protecting you. So your whole entire

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.000
 job is to get pilots, uh, toe location so that they can drop bombs

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.420
 or they can, you know, um, shoot their weapons and then come back safely.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.830
 Uh, we're basically the the support for them. So my job was basically

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.250
 to drive them there to make sure that they have services when

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.670
 they're in the ocean. So, for instance, I provide electricity for

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.080
 them. I provide the the speed to get them to the place that they need

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.500
 to go. I provide them with, um, general electrical things. Now you

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.910
 have to understand that when you're in the middle of the ocean, you're

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.330
 not really dealing with, um, war type of things. You know that you're

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.740
 in a war, but you have thio as long as you understand that you're

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.160
 in a in a support type role than days are pretty much the same,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.570
 you know, like you don't really see other than taking off and coming

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.990
 back. The pilots. You don't really see exactly how you affect the war

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.400
 at all. You just know that you got them there and that you're taking

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.820
 care of them when they're on the ship.
