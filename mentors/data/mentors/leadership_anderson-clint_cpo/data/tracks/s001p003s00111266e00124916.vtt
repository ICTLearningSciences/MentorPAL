00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.050
there is a strong line that you need to draw between, um, your friends

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.240
 and your co workers and especially your co workers and your subordinates.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.440
 Um, it can't be crossed over. They generally say that once you

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.630
 become a chief, all of the friends that you had, you know, if they

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.830
 were in your corner and if they were going to bat for you, then they'll

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.020
 understand the distinction that has to be drawn once you become

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.220
 a chief and they're not gonna treat you the same way that they did

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.420
 before. So you used to go toe clubbing or bars or joking around about

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.610
 the latest people on board this ship. All of that stops completely.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.810
 So in that case, once you turn that switch off, how do you turn it

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.000
 back on? All the people have toe develop a new type of respect for

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.200
 you. Uh, it generally comes from the fact that you're very knowledgeable

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.390
 about your your subject. That's why you're promoted in the first

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.590
 place. And the second part has to do with the fact that you're caring

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.780
 for them. You know you're caring for them as a team member and that

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.980
 you're looking out for their safety. With those two pieces in mind,

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.180
 um, the balance will actually, um, come as a side point. Um, whenever

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.370
 they become the the same leadership position is useful. For instance,

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.570
 off. You know, third class petty officers become first class

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.760
 petty officers, first class, first class. Petty Officer has become

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.960
 chiefs and chiefs. Maybe they become officers. Once those huge balance

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.150
 or jumped, then you're able toe like I have the same communion, but,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.350
 um, you definitely need to make that distinction.
