00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.950
I find inspiration from a lot of different avenues. Um, sometimes it's

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.040
 the people that I'm around. Um, sometimes it's especially friends when

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.140
 they're when they're successful, in their own jobs or in their own

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.240
 school. Um, but to tell you the truth, my biggest inspiration comes

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.340
 from the past historical feature. Historic historical figures. I

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.430
 have been learning about Albert Einstein recently, Isaac Newton. Some

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.530
 of the scientists that have pushed forward quantum mechanics and quantum

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.630
 computing. Um, those guys, you realize that for the vast majority

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.730
 of of their life, they're just normal guys. They have a wife and

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.820
 kids and they watch TV just like us. They go out and buy pants and

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.920
 clothes and hats, but, you know, for ah, section of their life, they

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.020
 actually really put forth their full effort. They read the books that

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.120
 it takes. They talk to the people, they do the math, Um, and and

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.210
 it's not normal, you know? That's what did you do for this Friday?

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.310
 Well, I was watching Netflix and some kind of YouTube movies, but what

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.410
 they did was they. They pushed themselves forward to the limits of

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.510
 human understanding, and then they made their own mark, and those

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.600
 are the type of people that I find inspiration from the people that

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.700
 are changing the world.
