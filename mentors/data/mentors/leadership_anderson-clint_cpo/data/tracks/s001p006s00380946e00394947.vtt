00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.400
One of the misconceptions that I had going in was being labeled an electrician's

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.940
 mate. And even though I dealt with a lot of electrical things,

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.490
 you know, I was a mate for Electrician's, um, generally the first

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.030
 six months that you that you're in the new power school deals with,

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.580
 like teaching about electrician's and about electrical things. Electrical

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.130
 equipment. However, once you become a new electrical operator,

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.670
 you deal less with fixing things. Um, there's a caveat to that.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.220
 If you go on a submarine, then they don't have regular electrician's.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.760
 There are only nukes Nuke Electrician's. So then you're you're fixing

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.310
 laundry machines and changing lights and, uh, changing out pumps.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.850
 And you know, there's there's only so many people on that ship. So

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.400
 you're expected to do everything, however, on an aircraft care, which

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.950
 is where I was, um, other electrician's. They take care of everything

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.490
 above the plants below the plants. There aren't that many, um,

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:09.040
 really complicated electrical things that you have to fix. Our goal

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.580
 was just toe maintain things. So there's a turbine generator. You take

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.130
 off everything, you dust it off, you increase it up and you put

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.680
 it back. If there is something broken. Oh, yeah, You know, the they

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.220
 tend toe pull in and they take off the whole entire machine and put

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.770
 a whole new contraption on it. So I I didn't get so much of fixing things,

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.310
 but I did become a much better operator. That's the difference

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.860
 that that I found being a nuclear electrician's mate.
