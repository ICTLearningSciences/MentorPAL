00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.360
So I think when a lot of people here in this question like, who would

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.880
 you like to meet? They probably think of celebrities, Um, maybe Eddie

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.390
 Murphy or, uh, Michael Jordan or something, you know, people that

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.910
 they look up to. But I think people are just people. I don't really

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.420
 have any interest in meeting most celebrities. Um, what I would like

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.940
 to do is, um, meet this girl that I had met, Um ah, couple of times

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.450

 coronavirus, basically, just when you're in my life just just sitting

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.480
 here doing, um, uh, college and playing video games and stuff. So

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.990
 I kind of But take that opportunity to kind of, like go to Japan.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.510
 That's where she is and kind of say, you know what? Like, um, I've been

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.020
 talking to you online. It would be really nice if we could just

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.540
 have a coffee and just talk a little bit. So coronavirus kind of like

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.050
 a makes me answer it that way.
