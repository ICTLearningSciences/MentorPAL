00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.360
sexual assault can almost happen anywhere in public places and private

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.880
 places, but they tend to happen more often, Um, and in intimate settings

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.390
 at the job. Then, uh, if you're working with another person, um,

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.910
 and you find them sexually attractive in a isolated location, those

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.420
 tend to be high risk areas. Uh, for me, as a chief, when I'm giving

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.940
 counseling, I always try toe have the door open, because when you

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.450
 have, uh, a person that that that could happen with and you have the

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.970
 door shut, then you know words gonna happen. Um, especially like,

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.480
 if if the two of you don't really, um, connect so much, then you know,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.000
 like false accusations can fly. So those air scenarios that you tryto

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.510
 have other people around so that they can kind of diffuse the situation

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.030
 or at least like make sure that, um, words aren't sad and touching

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.540
 aren't going on. Um, and it zips in the wide open area outside

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.060
 of work. The obvious places are bars and clubs, you know, even though

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.570
 it's ah very public setting because you don't feel as much, um,

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.090
 stress due to the job, um, like people are actually looking at at you,

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.600
 you know, like thinking about sexual assault. You let down your

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.120
 guard and you get a little bit more touchy, You know, out there in the

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.630
 drunk E you know, like, uh, hanging out areas and stuff. So, yeah,

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.150
 clubs bars isolated areas on the ship.
