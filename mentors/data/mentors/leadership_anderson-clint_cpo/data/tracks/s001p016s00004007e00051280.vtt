00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.920
foreign electrician's for active duty. You tend to do your first two years

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.990
 of school. That includes electrical training and learning about

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.060
 how the nuclear, uh, nuclear reactor works on how to become an operated

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.130
 for it. Um, the next four years should be spent on a ship. Now,

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.200
 that's just basically, uh, understanding how to do the technical aspect

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.270
 of it. Um, you're gonna be, uh, third class petty officer, second

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.340
 class petty officer, um, down there in the plants, Um, sometimes

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.410
 in the bills sometimes, um, working in, uh, in close operating station

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.490
 with, uh, watch upside down That's down there sometimes just going

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.560
 from level to level level, um, looking at pumps and valves and gauges.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.630
 And, uh, you know, the fixing things, doing preventive maintenance

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.700
 after you become a first class petty officer, then you've done that

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.770
 for the most part, and you're kind of supervising people. Um, you

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.840
 do that for about a couple of years, So you're at about your eight

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.910
 year mark, maybe even nine year mark, that you've been doing that Not

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.980
 only have you been a first class petty officer who who's been training

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.050
 people, but you've also had other experiences you've been maybe

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.120
 the training pitch officer, which, um, has a job of showing people

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.190
 all of the tech manuals and what's inside the tech manuals and how

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.260
 to read things from the tech manuals and doing power power Point presentations

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.330
 on some equipment that they've never seen before. You know,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.400
 that's when you kind of like extend, um, how our extended learning

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.470
 that we've done. Um, there's like three m co ordinator, where you

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.540
 and three in coordinator is not just a job for just Electrician's. It's

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.610
 like for for all the rates. And that's where you, um, make sure

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.690
 that all of the all of the work is done in accordance with some procedure,

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.760
 according Thio, whatever equipment you're supposed to be working

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.830
 on, so, um yeah, I'll leave it alone. But the point is, you go from

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.900
 job to job to job a za first class. So you have a really good perspective

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.970
 of the whole entire ship. Um, thing you might become a chief,

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.040
 And once you becoming chief, you actually start talking to the officers

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.110
 a lot more. It's kind of like your world kind of flips up. Um,

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.180
 you can think of it like a like one of those. Our glasses and the

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.250
 first class and the chief are kind of like in the middle. And once

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.320
 you become a chief, you still have to talk to the unit, Um, some. But

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.390
 it's more about telling the first class what he supposed to do. He

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.460
 filters it down, and then the first class tells you and then you filter

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.530
 it up. So that's when you start becoming more administrative oriented.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.600
 You tell the watch officer, um, what's going on the plant? What

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.670
 maintenance is being performed? Um, And in the unit, you, uh, make

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.740
 sure that everybody is on track to become promoted toe. Make sure

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.820
 that they're on track tow, cover all of their watches. And if there's

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.890
 some kind of problem with that, then you can you can you address

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.960
 it seeing chiefs and master chiefs. They're a little bit more specific.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.030
 Um, so if you become a senior chief, you do a lot of the things

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.100
 that a chief also does. But you also have a little bit more on career

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.170
 progression. Um, instead of being a three m coordinator, you could

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.240
 be, um, someone who is in charge of entire departments. Not just your

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.310
 unit, a senior chief, because they expect you toe, of course, no

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.380
 electric, uh, electrician's stuff as a senior chief. But they also expect

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.450
 you to be very familiar with the e t stuff. Elektronik technician

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.520
 and very familiar with the mechanical stuff. Maybe you also qualified.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.590
 Watch Super. Um, work center supervisor. I'm sorry, What supervisor

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.660
 and work center supervisor Where? Um, you actually have to understand

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.730
 the plant way more in depth. You could probably even write

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.800
 books about it, right? Procedures about it. Um, Master Chief, that's

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.870
 the highest that you could be the highest level that you could be,

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.940
 um, in the military. That's a level of e nine. And that's when you are

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.020
 so for the nukes, like they do have a they can't have a master chief

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.090
 that's in charge of the whole entire electrical department. But

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.160
 there's another master chief that's in charge of the whole entire nuclear

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.230
 section and even another master chief. They're all e nine who

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.300
 is in charge of the whole entire ship, and you could be either one of

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.370
 those. Um, it's more like lateral transfers when you're at that level,

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.440
 so yeah, to become a chief and might take about 10 years to become

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.510
 seeing chief could be like 12 or 13. To become a master chief, you

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.580
 could be pushing around 20 years at that time.
