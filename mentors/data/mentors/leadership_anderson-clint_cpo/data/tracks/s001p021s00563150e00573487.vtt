00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.070
if I personally see something, um, that's sexually inappropriate. Then,

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.300
 depending on the severity, I might go up to the to the offender and

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.520
 separately the Fendi and ask what happened. You know, try to get some

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.750
 kind of, um, some kind of basis for bringing it up to the highest

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.970
 level toe a higher level, something. They're pretty obvious, you know,

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.200
 if something, you know, egregious happens, I might just go straight

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.420
 to my to my supervisor and explain what happened. For the most

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.650
 part, if someone has, um, something bad happened to them, Uh, they're

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.870
 generally not supposed to come to me. We give a lot of training explaining

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.100
 who you're supposed to go to. We have posters everywhere. We

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.320
 have websites that you could go to. We have, you know, training very,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.550
 very often. Uh, that describes that, um, someone who thinks something

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.770
 bad happened to them. Go to the va, the victim's advocate or the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.000
 SAARC, and they can give them expert opinion about what they should

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.220
 do.
