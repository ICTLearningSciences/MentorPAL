00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.510
when you're moving to a new location, it's good to think about all of

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.180
 the things that you currently have and then just like mark them off

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.840
 one by one. And there could be cracks associated with any of them. If

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.500
 you think about your household goods, then how am I gonna get all

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.170
 the boxes, uh, to the place to my new location. Where are they gonna

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.830
 be sent? That's something that a lot of people don't I don't think

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.490
 about like if there's some kind of distance, if you have some kind of

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.160
 like you might need to get it from that place to your new location,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.820
 you might need a truck. You might need a U haul, or they might send

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.480
 it yourself. Um, those could be overlooked if if you used to do in

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.140
 a certain way, you can think about your kids. Um, their new school.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.810
 Do you need to talk to the teachers? Do there doesn't need to be some

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.470
 kind of signature that you need to sign. Um, you can also think about

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.130
 your car. Your car might have a different insurance requirement

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.800
 once you go to a new place, especially if you're like? Like, for instance,

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.460
 going to Japan if you have your license. Um, just as long as

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.120
 you have the list of items and you check each one by one, um, thinking

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.790
 about the place that you're going to, then you shouldn't have any

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.450
 problems.
