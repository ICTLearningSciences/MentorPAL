00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.360
the best resource is that you can have, especially if you're about to

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.880
 be a new leader. Uh, deals with people. If you wanna be an officer grabbing

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.390
 officer and taken to the side Say, Hey, tell me about where

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.910
 you've been, what you've been doing. Um, what life is like if you're

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.420
 in the listed ranks, grab the closest chief and say, Hey, you know

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.940
 what? Like I'm, uh, I'm about to be a leader. Um, I'm unsure about this

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.450
 or I know about this, but tell me about your personal situation

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.970
 there. There's tons of ways that you can ask these questions. Um, books

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.480
 air fine. But I found that most people, when it comes to leaders

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.000
 toe leadership, they generally, um, based on experience and the best

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.510
 way for experiences to get it from a real life conversation.
