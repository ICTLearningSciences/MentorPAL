I would say whatever you know should be immediately transferred to your

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.840
 family. Um, you might be going to another place and your kids might

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.840
 be going to another school. It's good to let them know so that they

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.840
 can start making their goodbyes to their friends. Um, if you're unsure

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.840
 of where you're going to be going, then it's just a heads up. If

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.830
 you're sure of where you're going to be going, then that's the sooner

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.830
 you You know, that, um, the better it is to start writing the documents

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.830
 to start changing jobs, uh, to start getting in contact with

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.820
 the people that you will be meeting with once you're there. So it could

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.820
 be a nice, smooth transition.
