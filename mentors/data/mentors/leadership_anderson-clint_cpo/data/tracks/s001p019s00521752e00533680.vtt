00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.810
I just recently came from Assessable Japan. Um, I had never been a shipyard

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.780
 superintendent before, but they're one of the guys that actually

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.740
 has to understand the entire workings of the ship. And because I

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.710
 had only been in the proportion plants, for the most part, has an electrician's.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.670
 Uh it was a really big task toe. Understand how how all

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.630
 of this worked? Um, what most reservists do and what even most like,

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.600
 uh, active duty people do once they first get there, they don't qualify

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.560
 shipyard superintendent so fast. And I was only there for four

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.530
 months. But I took it upon myself to say, You know what? Like let me

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.490
 start learning. I actually wanna, like, get that qualification, and

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.450
 it's a pretty big process. It could take half a year sometimes, and

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.420
 I want to do it in a shorter amount of time. Um, rather than, you

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.380
 know, like, say, maybe it's kind of difficult. He was all for it. Hey,

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.350
 gave me all of the materials to learn, and, um, he walked around

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.310
 with me, you know, talking about the ship. And hey gave me some shadow

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.270
 partners so that I could go along with them and start, you know,

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.240
 like getting my my watch. Um, my watch qualifications completed in a

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.200
 fast time. So I really appreciate the fact that he meant towards me,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.170
 and he got got that really difficult qualification done in a really

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.130
 short amount of time.
