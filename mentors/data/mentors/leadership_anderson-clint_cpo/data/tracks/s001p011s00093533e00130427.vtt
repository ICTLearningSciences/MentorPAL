00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.650
the biggest failure that I ever had, which I think about even all the

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.450
 time to this day is trying to get into the Naval Academy from doing

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.250
 two years in the new school and not being accepted. I I was putting

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.050
 forth my full effort every single weekend or maybe every other weekend.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.840
 You know, depending you'd have some test on Monday. And I remember

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.640
 just not really understanding all the new material that that that

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.440
 week and just being totally confused. But I remember just going in

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.240
 as soon as Friday. The bell hit, you know, just stand at the library.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.040
 Read, read, read. Going dinner. Come back, read, read until they kick

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.840
 you out, I think midnight or something. Um, Saturday was, you know,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.640
 you wake up in the morning, maybe you exercise. Maybe you like,

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.440
 uh, eat some breakfast, and then you go in and you're there until midnight.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.240
 You don't go anywhere else. Um, that Saturday was full of white

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.030
 boards and writing paper until my finger had, like, calluses on

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.830
 it. And then the Sunday would, um, would be more like, you know, review

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.630
 of what I did. I probably teach other people and that actually helped

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.430
 myself. Um, pretty much the whole day. And I wouldn't go home

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.230
 until I was sure that I would get a four point on the next test. Um,

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.030
 I think I got a four point at once, but the point is that I was I was

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.830
 confident in all of my answers. Um, So I did that for two years because

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.630
 to tell you the truth, I wasn't really interested in the in nuclear

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.430
 propulsion actually want to be a cryptologist. But I heard that

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.220
 this program, which I wasn't familiar with it had lots of math and

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.020
 science, and he transferred fluid flow in chemistry. It had all of

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.820
 that. And I thought that that would be a really good way Thio cover

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.620
 those things that I didn't in high school and prepared before the,

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.420
 you know, the intensive Naval Academy. So at at that two year point

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.220
 when I applied, I was, you know, had a really high G p a. I had a pretty

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.020
 good recommendations from all of my officers. Um, it came back,

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.820
 rejected, and I was actually surprised. Um, later on, the x o of the

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.620
 academy called me out of the blue I was studying, you know, kind of

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.420
 like, you know, like, um frustrated. And he called me and he said,

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.210
 Hey, you know, like, um, I just want to let you know, Like we saw your,

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.010
 uh, your application and, you know, we have some chit chat, and

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.810
 he said, Well, you know what? Like I think I'm gonna send you to boost,

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.610
 you know, because like, you're an excellent candidate, by the way,

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.410
 Um and then I told him I'm sorry. I'm, uh, past the age. I was 22

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.210
 but I would would have been 23 by the time. And that's the cut off.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.010
 And, you know, that was that was surprising to him. You know, I think

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.810
 it was prepared to like Cindy, and and he said, Well, what's honestly,

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.610
 you know, what was the case? Why did you choose your major? So

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.400
 he basically told me why I was rejected. I actually chose economics

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.200
 instead of engineering. Um, Major And I told him that, you know, I

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.000
 think I give some answer that I wanted to, like, learn languages. And

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.800
 I didn't think that it really mattered what major you did as long

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.600
 as you know, like you're gonna just learn leadership and other, um,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.400
 military qualities at the academy. And he said, Yeah, actually, were

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.200
 we expect engineers, uh, you know, computer science, mechanical engineering,

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.000
 electrical engineering. You know, those those are the main

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.800
 ones that we wanted. So, yeah, we parted ways and I didn't get accepted.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.590
 And that that was first time I've ever, ever really tried something

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.390
 other than tracking cross country in high school. But, um, academically,

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.190
 that's the first time I've ever put forth my full effort

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.990
 at something and then didn't get accepted. That's my biggest failure.
