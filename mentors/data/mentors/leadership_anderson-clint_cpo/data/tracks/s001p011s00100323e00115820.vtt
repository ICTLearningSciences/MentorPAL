00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.960
the most important factors of a situation that you have to consider. Um,

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.060
 of course, it depends on what thing you're talking about. If you're

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.170
 talking about a job, then, um, let's say there's a casualty. You

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.270
 have to look at the severity. You have to look at how many people are

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.380
 there? Um, if it's, ah, conversation, you have to look at the, um,

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.490
 the personal, the personality of the person that you're talking to.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.590
 Um, Is it someone who's gonna tend to cry? Is that someone who's gonna

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.700
 be emotional? Um so whatever situation you're looking at, um, just

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.800
 think about the past and think about the way that you can, um, do

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.910
 the right thing without getting without making the situation worse.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.020
 Um, that's what we as chiefs tend to do most of the time, were moderators,

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.120
 right. Um, there could be two people arguing, and we're the

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.230
 type of people have to be the type of person that can come in and break

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.340
 up a fight. Now, people do that in high school, you know, and like,

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.440
 if you were the type of person that could, like, grab a person to

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.550
 the left, to the right say, Hey, think about it. You know, then, um

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.650
 then you could be a chief. I'm not saying that you have to be able

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.760
 to do that as a as a chief, but there's some power being e seven and

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.870
 above, right. You could get in trouble if you try to attack me, or

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.970
 you can lose your rank, you can lose your money. Right? So it doesn't

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.080
 really matter what type of chief you are. You could be the newest

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.180
 chief on board. You could have been achieved for, like 20 years for

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.290
 10 years. And no matter what most of the enlisted people respect you

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.400
 respect your rank, respect your authority. So you have some power

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.500
 toe to break things up and toe, make the situation correct When you're

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.610
 doing counseling, uh, they respect your words. Um, it's because of

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.710
 all the chiefs that have come before us that have put that situation,

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.820
 um, into the navy, So
