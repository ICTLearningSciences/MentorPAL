    way, and they're not ableto think outside the box and do it themselves.

    senior sailors also knowing their position. When we do this, we are following
    the order. Um, and in boot camp, the first thing we learn is how to follow orders
    and thio to learn how thio follow the chain of command. And it starts with first
    acknowledging that there has been a order. Secondly, moving it up the chain, Um,
    that way, when it gets to the top, the top leaders sailors, um, they make the
    decision and then it can come back down. If you are overstepping your bounds or
    overstepping the chain of command, then there's a break in that chain. When when
    you look at it or when you think about it, you think of it just like a chain.
    Um, there are links to the chain, and the strongest link is at the top. But if
    you mess up the ones in the middle, then the chain is broken, so it's very important
    to utilize the chain of command

  transcript: in any organization or just, uh, and in a personal, uh, life boundaries
    have to be set. Um, I actually read a book about boundaries and set in your boundaries.
    Boundaries are important. Um, I know for me, I am a very, um, affectionate person.
    I am a very touchy person, and I realized everyone is not like that. And so you
    have to be able to sit down with someone, have conversations, get to know that
    person, get to know their boundaries. Eso that way, you're you're you're able
    Thio. Understand what that person, uh, or how that person feels when you are with
    them on a everyday basis. Being in this organization and part of the military,
    you're with people for long periods of times. You're with certain people for 2
    to 3 years at a time, and you have to get to know that person and know their boundaries,
    what they like and what they don't like. And it all starts with sitting down and
    having a conversation again. Like I said in the beginning, I am a very, uh, affectionate
    person, and I am a touchy feely person. One of the trainings we do learn. Um here
    in this organization is how to treat people and how to, uh, interact with people.
    Um, for example, when I'm speaking to someone, obviously professionally, and if
    I want to touch them to get my point across, one of the things that I am authorized
    to do and that I'm trained to do is to touch them very softly or lightly on their
    shoulder or touch their elbow. That way they are not. They don't feel threatened
    or they don't feel that it is sexual in nature. Also, one of the ways that we
    deal with people, and the one of the ways that we are trained to deal with others
    is to make sure that we are not in a person's personal space. And nine times out
    of 10, you can always tell when a person is uncomfortable with how close you are.
    To them, eso, one of the other areas is to make sure that you're aware of how
    you are speaking to people and dealing with people in their personal space

    Texas. I was on the ship for three years. As a culinary specialist, I realized
    I wanted to change my rate to something different as well. So that's one of my

    So ask the question again, please. A story that shows what it's like to work in
    my job. I have a sailor. Well, they're all my sailors. But this one in particular,
    Very smart, very strong. Wheeled, Um, once he wants to be a part of everything.
    Great. We sit down in a career development board. That's where we sit down and
    talk about the career path, your personal life moving forward, staying in the
    Navy, getting out of the Navy. This sailor wants to get out of the Navy. He's
    done his time. He's he's okay with eating out. But before he gets out, he wants
    to start school and very admirable. We're all taking college courses and things
    like that. And he wanted to take a college course before he got out. Great. Signed
    up a few months ago. Uh, the class is eight weeks long, signed up, and then he
    explained to me it was motivating. He's excited about it, and he did not come
    to me and tell me he was struggling. I found out that he was struggling in the
    course when the commanding officer received a letter stating that he failed the
    course and would have to pay the money back. So my commanding officer came and
    brought the letter to me and I had to call the sailor in. It's not a good look.
    It's not good when you're SCM senior listed leader did not know that you were
    struggling when we were having all these conversations about your career and moving
    forward. So I had to contact the sailor having come in, have the conversation
    about what was going on. And then he explained to me that he tried to withdraw,
    but he waited too late to withdraw. He didn't think it was going to be an issue.
    But it is an issue because the letter went straight to the CEO, bypassed myself,
    bypassed the CEO at the XO and went straight to the commanding officer. He felt
    bad about it, and he and I asked him the question. Waas. Well, why did you tell
    me you were struggling? He said he thought he could handle it on his own, and
    that's fine. Handle those things on your own. It's fine. However, he should have
    explained it to me so I could have warned the CEO that he was going to be receiving
    this letter. Um, it's unfortunate we did take care of it. It's been a few weeks
    now, and it's all been taken care of. But that's a lesson learned for all sailors.
    Talk to your senior enlisted leader before the issue or situation gets bigger
    than it has to, or definitely before it gets to the CEO.

    Navy, very young, a za cook, peeling potatoes. That's that was my goal to fill
    the potatoes and make sure that everybody on the ship was fed as I promote higher

    I think about the goals of my commanding officer, the gold of the secretary of

  transcript: the difficult part about training to be a leader waas understanding
    that I was going to be taking leadership leadership information for people who
    were younger than me. Um, you know, we think we always say, you know, age doesn't
    matter is just a number, but I joined this organization kind of late in life.
    So for me, being able to have an open mind and receive information for people
    who are younger than me and then trusting what they were saying was either true
    or I would have to follow up to make sure that what they were saying was was correct.
    So for me, I believe that, um, that that that barrier of the age difference, um
    that was a challenge for me.

    bring unhappiness to the team. How would I handle that? I I do believe in inclusion,
    including everybody, even the ones that don't wanna be a part of something. So
    I have to communicate. I have to speak to that sailor. I have to sit them down
    and ask them, Um, what's going on? How can I help you? Um, how do you see yourself
    being a part of the team, or do you even see yourself being part of the team?
    So in order to help someone, you have to communicate with them. We don't know
    their story. We don't know what happened the day before or the day. Or maybe that
    moment. So maybe they're going through something. So the biggest thing is to communicate.
    I have a sailor right now who, um, is struggling Thio be a part of the team? Um,
    he's unhappy. Um, he's ready to get out the Navy. And you know that cliche. One
    bad apple spoils the bunch. It's not always true. You could tell the ones that
    are unhappy and he is unhappy. And I just sat down with him today and I explained
    why I I just sat down with him and just asking the question of what's going on.
    He explained it. And while you think it's supposed to spill over into everyone
    else, it almost did. But it didn't. And one conversation, just one conversation,
    and he feels better, so I just believe in order. Thio, help someone get through
    that you have a conversation.

    I I saw myself as a leader. And but my rank, uh, had a lot to do with it because
    I was a junior sailor and I it was challenging to move forward with certain things
    the way I thought the way I spoke the way I carried myself. And unfortunately,
    in the in this organization, we do a lot of things by rank and being a junior
    sailor, um, motivated to do great things and to be that leader. I had to stay
    in my place because of being a junior sailor and how I overcame that was just
    by waiting out my time, making sure that I was studying and reading and so that
    I could get to that next level, um, actually tow where I'm at now so that I could,
    uh uh, be the leader that I know I could be and then understand that, um, the
    junior sailor, especially now coming in, Uh, a little smarter, knowing a little
    bit, mawr, um, knowing that they are the foundation, or they set the tone for
    what we know now. Um, and I'm okay with that. I didn't understand it before when
    I was that junior sailor, um, coming into the ranks. But now, being a leader,
    I do understand that even though your rank is a junior moving up the ranks, you
    should be able to listen and encompass everything that the junior sailor has to
    offer.

  transcript: the most challenging part about my job is being an advisor. Um, I love
    my position, but at some points in my position, I realized that I have to have
    uncomfortable conversations with my sailors. I have to have uncomfortable conversations
    with the triad. And at the end of the day, my CEO, um, he makes the final decision.
    For example, I had a sailor who, uh, may have potentially, um, been around someone
    who has cove it at this time. Right now, we are in this cove it situation with
    with this disease and being in the military, we have to be really careful with
    that s So I did have a sailor who was around someone who tested positive for Cove
    It on and he came toe work and let us know that hey was in that area while he
    was there. He was also told that everyone had been tested and it came back negative.
    I did advise the triad that, um it's important for us to let everyone else know.
    I was also told that we he didn't want to alarm anyone and because the test came
    back negative. But the bigger picture is that everyone should know who is in the
    area with someone who has, uh, tested positive for Covic. Attend of the day. I
    did advise my commanding officer about, uh, that situation. He did change his
    mind, um, and did allow me to put it out to the rest of the sailors. But I realized
    the challenging part for me is no matter what at the at the end of every conversation,
    at the end of every situation that I advise him on, he is the deciding factor.

    way things I ran on. Sometimes you come home and you bring that home. Uh, the
    way you maybe speak to your family in a forceful manner, things like that. So
    I believe as a parent, we we have to pay attention to our role at work, pay attention
    to our job experience at work because sometimes it would carry over to our family
    life. Being an R D. C was an amazing job, but it was it was very stressful is
