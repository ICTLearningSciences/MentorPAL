00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.710
it is a best practice that as soon as you find out where you are going

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.560
 to move or when you're deciding to move to your next location to get

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.420
 your family involved in the beginning. This way, if you especially

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.270
 if you have Children, this gets them, um, involved, um, allowing them

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.130
 to see the different places showing them on the computer, googling

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.980
 different areas. Fun things for them to do. Different school areas.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.840
 What the schools have to offer. It's important that you get your family,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.690
 um, involved at the beginning. Um, that way, when they get there,

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.550
 it will be like they had been there already.
