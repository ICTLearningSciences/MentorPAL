00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.360
one of the common crimes here in, uh, California. Um, this state is has

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:13.860
 legalized marijuana, and we have a very large component of reserve

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.370
 sailors, um, to include by our my active duty component. But one of

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:26.870
 the crimes that we really have to be careful of is Thea the marijuana.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:33.380
 Some of our sailors have, um, came positive on a your analysis for

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:39.880
 marijuana. Um, here in California. Like I said, it's legalized, but

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:46.390
 we are. We fall under the ucmj a, which is zero tolerance for drugs,

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:52.900
 and we also fall under federal guidelines. We understand that the

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.400
 state has legalized marijuana, but for the United States Navy, it

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.910
 is not authorized. And we do have some sailors. Um who I don't want

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:12.410
 to say, pop, but who? Who test positive for marijuana and high levels

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:18.920
 of THC.
