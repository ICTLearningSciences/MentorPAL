00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.810
the difficult part about training to be a leader waas understanding that

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.760
 I was going to be taking leadership leadership information for people

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.720
 who were younger than me. Um, you know, we think we always say,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.670
 you know, age doesn't matter is just a number, but I joined this organization

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.630
 kind of late in life. So for me, being able to have an open

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.590
 mind and receive information for people who are younger than me and

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.540
 then trusting what they were saying was either true or I would have

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.500
 to follow up to make sure that what they were saying was was correct.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.450
 So for me, I believe that, um, that that that barrier of the age

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:00.410
 difference, um that was a challenge for me.
