00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.490
the physical environments that I've worked. I came in the Navy on a ship.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:12.130
 The first, uh, my first tour was on a ship. Uh, the USS Carl Marotte

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.770
 in Major C 57 out of Sync, Ingleside, Texas. I was a culinary specialist

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.410
 then, and that physical environment, um, was very task tasking.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:29.050
 It was three of us on this ship myself. I was a third class a

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.690
 second class in the first class. Um, all weather ship. A very small

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.330
 ship, 186 ft long. There were only 50 p 54 people to include, uh, 15

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.970
 women out of the 54 people. Very, uh, physical. A lot of physical work

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.610
 you would expect for a CS to be in the galley cooking. Correct?

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.250
 Well, some of my the things that I had to do waas, um when there was

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.890
 low visibility, they would call me out of my racket night, and I would

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.530
 have to go and sit on on the folks all and be the eyes and the ears

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.170
 for the ship. And that would be after working long hours in the

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.810
 galley. So very physical and taxing another, uh, physical part of being

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.450
 in the Navy. I actually received my CFL command fitness leader,

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.090
 um, certification and which helped me to be part of the PR ts. Ah, lot

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.730
 of the PF phase that we administer here at not San Jose. And at on

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:42.370
 this ship, I was able to watch Ah, sit ups, Um, push ups. We couldn't

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:48.010
 do run on the ship, but all we could really do was push ups and

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.650
 sit ups. So, to me, that's part of my physical ability. And then here

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:59.290
 at the Nas here in San Jose, I'm not able to be the command fitness

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.930
 leader, but just this job itself is very physical. We, um, work out

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.570
 PT five times a week. We are in our blue and gold yellow T shirts,

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.210
 blue bottoms, um, to me, that's being part of the physical part of
