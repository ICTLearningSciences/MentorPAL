00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.710
in the military the way taxes work. First off, if you're obviously you're

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.570
 working, so your federal taxes are always paid. Um, your state taxes

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:21.430
 are paid from your home of record. Um, one of the amazing things

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:28.290
 about being in the military is that you get to go to the commissary

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:35.150
 and the exchange and your taxes on everything is tax free.
