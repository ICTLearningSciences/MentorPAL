00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.280
what I do now, Um, what I thought I was going to be doing in the Navy,

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.710
 and what I do now, um, really isn't different. Um, I knew when I can't.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:17.140
 When I joined the Navy, it was gonna be a physical, uh, challenge

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.580
 in the Navy. And I love being physical. I knew I was going to take

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.010
 care of people. I my sailors, like, I take care of my family, so I

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.440
 don't really think anything has is different from when I was a civilian.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.870
 Andi thinking about joining the Navy, It's all actually worked

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.300
 itself out to where I have the best of both worlds. My civilian life

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.730
 has kind of carried over into my, uh, navy life. Um, very active before

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.160
 I joined the Navy. Physical gymnastics, cheerleading ran track,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.590
 and it has carried over, um, into the navy singing, um, I sing Sometimes

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.030
 I sing the national anthem anthem at different events. So it

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.460
 all has actually, uh, worked itself out. And I do everything that I

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.890
 did in the civilian world, and I've actually incorporated it here in

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.320
 the Navy
