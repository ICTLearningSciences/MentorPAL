WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.310
some of the ways that I deal with stress on the job. Um one, um I like

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:13.780
 to have conversations. So when I'm stressed, uh, maybe with a sailor

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:20.240
 or with my triad, I have a conversation. First, I have to have the

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.700
 conversation, ask the questions. Why, um, why are we doing things this

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:33.170
 way? Um, how can we do things better? And then I go to my office

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.630
 and I sit by myself and I reflect. And once I reflect and I journal,

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:46.100
 take my notes. Then I I de stress myself personally by going to the

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.560
 gym, Uh, maybe speaking to someone outside of my command. Ah, counselor.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:59.020
 Ah, close friend. Someone who doesn't have any, uh, connection

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:05.490
 with what I'm doing. And that helps me de stress from majority of

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:11.950
 the situations that I go through here at work
