00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.450
if a person that you know is having, uh, suit of suicidal ideations or

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.050
 thoughts or feelings or conversations And did you and you know that

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.650
 they have weapons, uh, at their home or on their person? The one thing

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.250
 I believe that you could do is stay with them, stay with them, have

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.850
 someone, uh, meet them at their home or wherever you believe that

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.450
 they have these, uh, items. Um, it is very important. The number one

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.050
 thing is to stay with them and don't leave them. Ah, lot of people,

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.650
 uh, when they are having suicidal thoughts and ideations, one of

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.250
 the things that could help them or save their life is that you didn't

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.850
 leave them. You were. You were there listening and having a conversation

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.450
 with them.
