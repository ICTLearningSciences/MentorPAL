00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.370
one of the challenges that I faced, Uh, coming up through the ranks is,

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.890
 um, my For me, the challenge would be, uh, being maybe ah, junior

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:17.410
 and and my age is one of the challenges for me as, um, coming up the

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.930
 ranks. I was a junior sailor, but my age was a little older. Um, and

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.450
 for me, that was a challenge, because I I saw myself as a leader.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.970
 And but my rank, uh, had a lot to do with it because I was a junior

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.490
 sailor and I it was challenging to move forward with certain things

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:45.010
 the way I thought the way I spoke the way I carried myself. And unfortunately,

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.530
 in the in this organization, we do a lot of things by rank

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.050
 and being a junior sailor, um, motivated to do great things and to

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.570
 be that leader. I had to stay in my place because of being a junior

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.100
 sailor and how I overcame that was just by waiting out my time, making

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.620
 sure that I was studying and reading and so that I could get to

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.140
 that next level, um, actually tow where I'm at now so that I could,

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.660
 uh uh, be the leader that I know I could be and then understand that,

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.180
 um, the junior sailor, especially now coming in, Uh, a little smarter,

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.700
 knowing a little bit, mawr, um, knowing that they are the foundation,

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.220
 or they set the tone for what we know now. Um, and I'm okay with

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.740
 that. I didn't understand it before when I was that junior sailor,

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.260
 um, coming into the ranks. But now, being a leader, I do understand

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.780
 that even though your rank is a junior moving up the ranks, you should

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.300
 be able to listen and encompass everything that the junior sailor

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.820
 has to offer.
