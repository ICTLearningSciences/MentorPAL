00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.880
So while there are different situations or different areas and locations

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.920
 where I am concerned about sexual harassment, I think the some of

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.950
 the factors would be or added factors would be if the person is, um,

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.980
 by themselves, they're single, Um, and it doesn't matter if it's male

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.020
 or female, Um, and then if there's alcohol involved, I don't want

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.050
 to say that there are areas where it could happen mostly, for example,

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.090
 if they're on a ship or if they're overseas sexual harassment.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.120
 If it's going to happen, it can happen anywhere from your smallest commands

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.150
 to your larger commands. It can definitely happen. It just means

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.190
 that we have to be very vigilant and making sure that we are paying

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.220
 attention to the things that are going on. Mhm.
