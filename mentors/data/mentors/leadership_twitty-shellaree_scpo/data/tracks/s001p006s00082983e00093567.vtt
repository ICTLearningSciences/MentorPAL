WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.340
using different types of leadership strategies on different types of people.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.820
 For example, a sailor who has been in, uh, this organization

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.310
 for a very long time. Uh, one of the leadership strategies I would uses

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.800
 or even speak about would be for him to he or she to be open minded,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.280
 open minded for growth or toe. Learn something new. Um, And then

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.770
 my sailor who comes in that is, uh, brand new, uh, fresh out of boot

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.260
 camp. Motivated, uh, I think hit a different leadership strategy

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.740
 for him. Or he or she would be to, uh, tell him what I need, Thio. What

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:50.230
 needs to happen and allow them to either share their experiences

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.720
 so that they can feel part of the team. So two different types of leadership

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.200
 style, you have to meet the person where they're at in there

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.690
 journey in this organization.
