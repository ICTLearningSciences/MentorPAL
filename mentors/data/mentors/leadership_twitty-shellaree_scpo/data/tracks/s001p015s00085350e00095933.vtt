00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.430
so situations happen all the time. Um, and in some situations, you may

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:14.020
 have to take the blame for something you didn't cause. So you have

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:20.600
 to ask yourself, should you take that blame for something you didn't

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:27.180
 cause? So for me, Um, if I don't want to say I'm taking the blame,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.770
 I'm going to take the responsibility and own up. Um, for one of my sailors

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:40.350
 who did not, maybe or misunderstood my training or misunderstood,

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.930
 uh, what I was trying to get them to do. Um, And if someone higher

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.510
 up than them higher up on the chain, uh, blame them for something,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:00.100
 I would take responsibility for it. And I would just ask, How can

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.680
 we fix it? Let us fix it and come back and make it right.
