00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.380
one of the biggest risks I take in my career is being an adviser to my

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.910
 chain of command. My triad. Um, all conversations have to be had, Um,

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.450
 there are some tough conversations that have to be had advising your

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.980
 CEO. Um, when things come up, whether they're good, bad or ugly.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.510
 Um, I am the adviser. Um, the risk I take with sharing things with

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.040
 my commanding officer, um, explaining to him that this might not be

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.570
 in the best interests of the command And then at the end of the day,

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.100
 knowing that he is the one that makes the final decision. And he's

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.640
 and he's also the one that writes my evil my evaluation at the end of

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.170
 the day, um, I have to be honest and true. With what? What? My beliefs,

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.700
 our And just know that what I said, um, what I say how I handle

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.230
 things with my commanding officer, that they're going to be taken

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.760
 professionally and respectfully and hope that he understands that the

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.290
 best interests of the command and himself, um, and the sailors are

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.830
 are taken, um, in a professional manner. And then, like I said again,

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.360
 um, always remembering that at the end of the day he is the one that

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.890
 makes the final decision, and that's to me can be, ah risk.
