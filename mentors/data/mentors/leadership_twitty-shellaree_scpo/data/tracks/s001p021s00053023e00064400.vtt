00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.000
when I'm dealing with situations or failures that I did not cause or if

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.140
 I could say it was not my fault. The first thing I do is I don't find

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:19.290
 fault in someone else. Um e I, um I own whatever the situation Waas

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:25.440
 I believe that getting through it with starting with me because

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.590
 of whatever the situation was whatever, whoever the person was that

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.730
 that may have failed them. Um, I own it, and I take ownership of it

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.880
 and help that person get through it. Um, even if they want to talk about

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:50.030
 you know how it failed, who failed and things like that, that's

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.180
 fine, because sometimes that feeling, But the most important part is

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.320
 getting through it and getting past it, Um, not only for, um, that

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.470
 person, but it will help them grow and then teach them that even though

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.620
 somebody failed them, there is a way to get through it.
