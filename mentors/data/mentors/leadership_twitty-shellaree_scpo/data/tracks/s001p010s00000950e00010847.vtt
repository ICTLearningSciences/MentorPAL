Hello. My name is Senior Chief Celery Twitty. I've been in the Navy for

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.570
 19 years. I am the senior listed leader here in San Jose, California

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.930
 I work at the Naval Operational Support Center. My job consists of

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.290
 taking care of sailors. That's what I like to do. I started out in

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.650
 Akron, Ohio, as a reservist, and I did the reserve time for two years.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.020
 It was around 9 11, and I actually went active duty after that.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.380
 I spent some time in Akron, Ohio, from their Ingleside, Texas. Uh, Jacksonville,

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.740
 Florida. Great Lakes. Illinois is back to boot camp, the

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:49.100
 Bureau of Medicine Surgery in Falls Church. And now I'm here in California.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.460
 I am a single mother of six Children, five boys and one girl,

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.820
 and I have one granddaughter.
