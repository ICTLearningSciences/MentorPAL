00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.570
if I take a difficult assignment, for example, out of the country family,

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:12.280
 friends, uh, peers, um, they will be affected. Um, in all types

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.000
 of ways, um, some could be positive, and some could be negative. One

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.710
 of the great things about, uh, technology is that we're able to, uh,

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.430
 see people on our phones now, um, using facetime. Um, there are Google

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.140
 networks that allow you to, uh, talk and not be charged for using

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.860
 their streaming, uh, accesses. Um, while it will be difficult. Um,

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.570
 even for you, if you were to move out of the country, your friends

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.290
 and family will be affected, Um, in good and bad ways. Um, but I believe

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:58.000
 it's how you handle it and how you deal with it that will help

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.720
 them get through, um, any concerns or questions they may have with

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.430
 you moving out of the country or to a place where you may not be able

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.150
 to take your family
