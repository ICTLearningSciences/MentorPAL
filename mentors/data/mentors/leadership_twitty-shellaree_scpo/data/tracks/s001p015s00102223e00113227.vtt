00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.690
So when you have a team, you understand that everything is not going to

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.520
 go perfect. Um, there's gonna be some agreements, and they're going

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.360
 to be some disagreements. If I were faced with a disagreement, one

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.200
 of the ways I would handle it is, uh, toe ask, how can we fix it? How

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.030
 can we get through it? Um, in order for the team to get to that next

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.870
 level to complete the mission, we we have to be able to communicate,

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.710
 and some disagreements are part of it. So how we handle it, how

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.540
 we talk through it, um, to get to the end goal is what's gonna be important.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.380
 So while there are many ways I could have explained how there

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.220
 are disagreements, I just know when you have disagreements, the

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.050
 best thing to do is to communicate to so that you can get to the end

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.890
 goal
