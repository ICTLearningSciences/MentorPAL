00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.550
so as a parent, some of the things that I find useful being a leader,

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:12.250
 um, at home is, um, the way I, uh, I organized, uh, myself at work.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.950
 I could bring that home, uh, to my family. Andi. And that could be a

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.650
 positive thing. Some of the areas of concern would be, um, for example,

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.350
 if I was an r at RTC, and I was, ah, recruit, division commander.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:35.050
 We all understand the boot camp policy and the way things I ran on.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.750
 Sometimes you come home and you bring that home. Uh, the way you

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.450
 maybe speak to your family in a forceful manner, things like that. So

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:52.150
 I believe as a parent, we we have to pay attention to our role at

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.850
 work, pay attention to our job experience at work because sometimes

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.550
 it would carry over to our family life. Being an R D. C was an amazing

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.250
 job, but it was it was very stressful is well, and sometimes I remember

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.950
 coming home as a mom as a parent and barking at my Children.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.650
 Or, uh, I don't want to say yelling, but you know, being a little stronger

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.350
 with my tone with them when I needed things to get done. So I

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.050
 think as a parent, we have to pay attention to, uh the way we do things

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.750
 at our job and the way we allow it to carry over, um, with our

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.450
 family and at home.
