00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.840
some of the problems that come to my death. Um, and one I remember particularly

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.820
 we had a sailor who actually did not have a driver's license.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.810
 Um, this sailor is 20 years old, 21 belay my last 21 years old and

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.800
 had been in the Navy for three years and never received a driver's

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.780
 license. Eso those were some of the that was to me was Ah, very, uh,

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.770
 serious, uh, situation or issue because we have where you stand a

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.760
 watch the command duty officer watch. And everybody here at the NAS

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.740
 has toe have that watch, and it means that you have to drive a vehicle.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:54.730
 So we worked really hard his first six months being on board to

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.720
 help him get his driver's license. Um, we the other issues are marital

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.700
 issues with family members thes air personal, and we do what we

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.690
 deal with a lot of personal issues. We have a sailor who actually went

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.670
 through Ah, bad divorce and custody battle. We've also had a sailor

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.660
 who was, uh, found, um, Well, his he was had a DUI, and, um, we had

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.650
 to go to court for his do and speak on his behalf. Um, I was one

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.630
 of the character witnesses. I had to actually write a letter. Um, speaking

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.620
 about his character. They ended up dropping it because he actually

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.610
 told on himself Hey, didn't hurt anyone. He ran into a rail, and

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.590
 he called the police on himself, so they end up dropping it. But

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.580
 a lot of, uh, issues like that, um, come across my desk.
