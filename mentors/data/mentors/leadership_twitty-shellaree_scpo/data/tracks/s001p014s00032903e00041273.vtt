00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.090
some of the first steps in setting out as a new leader is Take your time.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:13.340
 Walk around, get to know your sailors, your staff, maybe read a

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.580
 book. One of the books that I've read was the 1st 90 days. Being a good

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.820
 leader has a lot to do with your confidence is Well, um, just knowing

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.060
 what you can do what you can't do. But the main and most important

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:38.310
 is, uh, pacing yourself, taking your time, getting to know your

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:44.550
 savings and your staff.
