00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.230
as a leader, I believe in empowerment. There are some things that I believe

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.620
 that at my level the senior chief lead level, the senior enlisted

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.000
 leader level, um that I could take care of and make sure that the

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.380
 x o and see O are very involved and informed. However, I do believe

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.770
 that the empowerment of my my lpo, uh, my junior sailors empowering

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.150
 them, delegating different things down to them and giving them a chance

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.530
 to be the leader that I know there could be. Um I'm really into

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.920
 that African proverb. Each one teach one. And in order for them to

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.300
 be, uh, to be in my position one day, they have to work me out of a

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.680
 job. So I do believe in sharing o. R. Delegating so that it comes back

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.070
 to me. And then it's a training, uh, a training, a teachable moment

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.450
 as well
