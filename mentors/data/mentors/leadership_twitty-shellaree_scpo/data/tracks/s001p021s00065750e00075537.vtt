Uh huh. So when I have to deliver bad news, for example, a family emergency

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:17.380
 or loss, I asked the sailor to come into my office on DWI. Go

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:25.650
 somewhere where it's just he or she and I, um I asked them how they're

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:33.920
 doing. Um, and then I I break the news to them. It could be very

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:42.190
 devastating, especially if you're out in the open in front of a lot

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:50.450
 of people. So when I have to deliver something, um, some sad news or

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:58.720
 some bad news it's best to be in a one on one situation. Wow.
