00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.330
here at my command when a person fails when a sailor fails, Um, it's very

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:13.810
 unfortunate. However, uh is growth. We deal with it by allowing

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:20.290
 the sailor to fail, um, and then asking the questions, You know what

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:26.770
 happened? How can we help? Um, and this brings out a conversation where

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:33.250
 they're able to speak about their failure and then learn from their

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.730
 failure. Um, I believe in second chances. If you're not failing,

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:46.210
 if you're not, uh, making mistakes, um, then you're not growing. Um,

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.690
 I don't believe that it's a weakness if you fail. Um, it's part of

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:59.170
 maybe some challenges, but myself, As a senior listed leader, I, um

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.650
 I accept it and allow that person to grow from it.
