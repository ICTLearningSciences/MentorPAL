00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.360
the view of my line of work has changed over time has me remembering when

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.880
 I would watch, uh, military shows on TV. I think about how, uh,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.390
 the military was just so hard core and they were up in your face and

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.900
 kind of negative. That's the way it was portrayed. What I feel now

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.410
 is that the military is more like a family, Um, at least for me. Um,

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.930
 you think about your family members who have challenges, who aren't

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.440
 perfect, that you think about your motivating family members who want

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.950
 to share everything. And they're they're just the sunshine in your

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.460
 life. And that is the way I view this, this organization now, um,

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.980
 as we as I As I go up the ranks, I realized that I am just I'm more

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.490
 personable with sailors. I'm more personable with my officers and things

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:07.000
 like that. It's not as hard core as it used to be. It Z. It's still

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.510
 tough and challenging, but you're you're ableto thio. Take care

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.030
 of people the way you see fit and not the way it's, um, done in. And,

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.540
 uh, like a like a robotic way. Um, that's how I as you this organization,

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.050
 the Navy now
