WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.370
the biggest failure that I have had, and I don't even know if it is really

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.900
 a failure. I really believe it's a lesson eso going up for Senior

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.420
 Chief, I think I've done that. I've put in a package, uh, for Senior

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.950
 Chief maybe five times. And each time I started to question myself

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.470
 like some of us do. And, um, you almost feel like you're failing,

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.990
 because in your mind, you're you're doing everything that you need

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.520
 to do as you know, to stay competitive in this organization, um, and

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.040
 to just take care of your sailors and your peers. And I think for me,

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.560
 the biggest failure was, uh, the fact that I questioned myself on

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:56.090
 guy, You get to a point where you don't feel like you're worthy of

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.610
 of of promotion. Andi, I think for me, that was the failure on my part.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.140
 I could tell the story and maybe encourage others. But then the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.660
 self reflection I have for myself and feeling that way, um, second guessing

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:18.180
 myself. And that was a failure to me. What I learned from that

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.710
 is, even though I question myself and I was, uh, I did my self reflection.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.230
 I also learned that there's growth in that, Um, and it makes

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.750
 me a better person both personally and professionally. So although

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.280
 it didn't seem like a failure, the story doesn't seem like a failure

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.800
 because maybe it's personal, But for me, it made me feel some type

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.330
 of way and cause me to feel like it was It's part of being a failure,

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.850
 but I grew from it.
