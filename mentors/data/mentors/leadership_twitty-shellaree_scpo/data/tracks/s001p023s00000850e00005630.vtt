00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.680
one of my favorite books is Love, like You've Never Been Hurt and the

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.510
 reason why Thio is because I went through a bad divorce and I had some

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:21.340
 concerns about me, and when I read that book, it showed me and it

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:28.160
 taught me that love starts with me now. I really knew that already.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.990
 But it confirmed it confirmed that love starts with me and for me to

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:41.820
 love, like I've never been hurt and that it was okay to be vulnerable,

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.650
 so that is one of my favorite books.
