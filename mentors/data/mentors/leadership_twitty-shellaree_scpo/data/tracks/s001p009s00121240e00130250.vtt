00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.420
some of the other types of harassment that we see, um, in the organization

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.980
 is, uh, bullying, if that's, uh, considered a harassment on. But

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.550
 it's we have zero tolerance, obviously, in this organization for bullying.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.120
 But those were some of the things taunting people. Um, sometimes

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.680
 those things are done out in the open on Did you can pick up on

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.250
 the signs? Um, very quickly. Other times is done, um, in the privacy

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.820
 or in in in a, uh, enclosed space or in a personal space. And then

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.380
 we have to just pay attention to the signs asking questions, uh, seeking

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.950
 help for the member and different things like that.
