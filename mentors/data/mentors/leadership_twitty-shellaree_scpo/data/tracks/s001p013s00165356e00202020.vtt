00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.430
Well, I think this story that I have right now just thinking about it.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:12.020
 So ask the question again, please. A story that shows what it's like

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.600
 to work in my job. I have a sailor. Well, they're all my sailors.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.190
 But this one in particular, Very smart, very strong. Wheeled, Um, once

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.770
 he wants to be a part of everything. Great. We sit down in a career

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.360
 development board. That's where we sit down and talk about the career

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.940
 path, your personal life moving forward, staying in the Navy, getting

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.530
 out of the Navy. This sailor wants to get out of the Navy. He's

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.110
 done his time. He's he's okay with eating out. But before he gets

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.700
 out, he wants to start school and very admirable. We're all taking

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.280
 college courses and things like that. And he wanted to take a college

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.870
 course before he got out. Great. Signed up a few months ago. Uh, the

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:13.450
 class is eight weeks long, signed up, and then he explained to me

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.030
 it was motivating. He's excited about it, and he did not come to me

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.620
 and tell me he was struggling. I found out that he was struggling in

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.200
 the course when the commanding officer received a letter stating that

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.790
 he failed the course and would have to pay the money back. So my

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.370
 commanding officer came and brought the letter to me and I had to call

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.960
 the sailor in. It's not a good look. It's not good when you're SCM

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.540
 senior listed leader did not know that you were struggling when we

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.130
 were having all these conversations about your career and moving forward.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.710
 So I had to contact the sailor having come in, have the conversation

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.300
 about what was going on. And then he explained to me that he

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.880
 tried to withdraw, but he waited too late to withdraw. He didn't think

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.460
 it was going to be an issue. But it is an issue because the letter

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.050
 went straight to the CEO, bypassed myself, bypassed the CEO at the

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.630
 XO and went straight to the commanding officer. He felt bad about

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.220
 it, and he and I asked him the question. Waas. Well, why did you tell

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.800
 me you were struggling? He said he thought he could handle it on

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.390
 his own, and that's fine. Handle those things on your own. It's fine.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.970
 However, he should have explained it to me so I could have warned

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.560
 the CEO that he was going to be receiving this letter. Um, it's unfortunate

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.140
 we did take care of it. It's been a few weeks now, and it's

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.730
 all been taken care of. But that's a lesson learned for all sailors.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.310
 Talk to your senior enlisted leader before the issue or situation gets

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.900
 bigger than it has to, or definitely before it gets to the CEO.
