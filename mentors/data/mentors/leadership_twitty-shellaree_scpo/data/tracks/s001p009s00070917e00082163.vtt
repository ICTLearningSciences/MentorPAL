I can say, since I've been here at the reserve Center that I have not

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.930
 had any, uh, instances or incidents. My apologies with sexual harassment.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.960
 A few years back, I was able to get the certification to be a

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.000
 sapper victims advocate. And, um, I carried around the cell phone, and

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.040
 I have I have not had any instances with sexual harassment, our sexual

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.080
 assault. One of the things that I do feel that's important, though,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:43.120
 is that we are aware of behaviors of that kind of thing. Um, there

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.160
 are trainings that could be done as well. So although I do have

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.190
 the I don't have the, uh, certification anymore, because I'm the S

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.230
 e l. And it would be a conflict of interest. I still have thio know

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.270
 the process and procedures and to make sure that everyone is aware of

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.310
 of sexual harassment and reporting processes.
