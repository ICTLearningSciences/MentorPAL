00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.750
at the start of my career. I was young in the Navy and I understood the

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.650
 mission mission had to get done as it has actually progressed. The

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.550
 mission still has to get done. But I think about the needs of my sailors,

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.450
 the needs of others. And in order for the mission to be completed,

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.350
 I have to meet the needs of my sailors. Uh, of the people, my

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.250
 junior, is the people that I am leaving. I have to meet their needs

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.150
 and the mission will be completed.
