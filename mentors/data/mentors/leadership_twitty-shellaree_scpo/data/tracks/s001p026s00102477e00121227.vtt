00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.510
as the s e l. There are a lot of things that causes, uh, me a lot of stress.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:12.170
 Um, the way I deal with my sailors, the way I deal with my triad.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.820
 My commanding officer, Um, I worry a lot. I worry a lot about how

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.480
 the people around me are affected by their situations, Uh, their

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.140
 lives both professionally and and personally. Um, and that for me, causes

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.800
 a lot of stress. Um, for example, when I have conversations with

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.460
 my commanding officer, uh, about how we want to do certain things

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.110
 as faras running the command and how we deal with our sailors, Um,

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.770
 if he doesn't understand, uh, that each sailor has to be, um, dealt

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.430
 with, um, on a case by case basis. And I have to advise him of that

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.090
 that all sailors are not the same, that they're different. Um, that

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.740
 concerns me. And and and it worries me, and it does cause me some stress.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.400
 Um, when I'm dealing with my sailors and they don't understand

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.060
 that I have to deal with them, um, actually, on a by case basis and

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.720
 everything in their situation, um, is different from maybe their peer

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.380
 or their junior sailor and I have to deal with them on different

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.030
 levels. Um, that's stressful. Um, and it is because I do worry. I want

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.690
 the best out of everyone. And it does cause me thio to feel a little

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.350
 stressful E.
