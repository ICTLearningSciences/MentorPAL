00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.120
something that I think is very important for junior and senior leaders

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.380
 to know, um is the chain of command. It is so important to follow the

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.650
 chain of command. It starts with, uh, the junior sailors knowing

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.920
 their position and the senior sailors also knowing their position. When

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.180
 we do this, we are following the order. Um, and in boot camp, the

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.450
 first thing we learn is how to follow orders and thio to learn how

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.720
 thio follow the chain of command. And it starts with first acknowledging

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.990
 that there has been a order. Secondly, moving it up the chain,

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:48.250
 Um, that way, when it gets to the top, the top leaders sailors, um,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.520
 they make the decision and then it can come back down. If you are overstepping

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.790
 your bounds or overstepping the chain of command, then there's

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.050
 a break in that chain. When when you look at it or when you think

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.320
 about it, you think of it just like a chain. Um, there are links

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.590
 to the chain, and the strongest link is at the top. But if you mess

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.850
 up the ones in the middle, then the chain is broken, so it's very

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.120
 important to utilize the chain of command
