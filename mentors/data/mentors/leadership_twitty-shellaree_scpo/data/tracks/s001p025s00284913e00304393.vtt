00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.890
a pivotal moment in my career was when I was going through a divorce at

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.930
 a A junior as a junior sailor. It was pivotal because I also had my

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.980
 Children and I was on the ship, and I actually had to send my Children

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.020
 home to my parents while I was going through the divorce. Um, it

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:31.060
 was devastating. Um, there were court dates. There were days I had

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:37.100
 thio miss work. Um, okay. And it was mentally draining. I did get through

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.140
 it because I had my, uh, my leadership who believed in me and

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.190
 and knew that I was a great sailor. But it was It was personally, very

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.230
 hard and taxing on me mentally. Um, I had to go to counseling because

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.270
 of it, and my Children had to go to counseling before they left.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.310
 So while I still had to do my job and, um, take care of my family,

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.360
 it was very trying and and and and hard for me. But at the end of

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.400
 the day, I did get through it. Um, just remembering who was there for

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.440

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.480
