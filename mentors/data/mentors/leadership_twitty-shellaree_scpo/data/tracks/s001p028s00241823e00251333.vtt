00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.360
moving overseas or relocating toe overseas. The first thing you should

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.870
 do is make sure that you have the support of your family in the beginning,

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.380
 um, making that transition to move overseas. Unless you have

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.890
 someone over there that's part of your family, you're actually going

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.400
 to be, um, without your support system. So the first thing you should

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.910
 do is make sure that you're explaining that to everyone that is

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.420
 a part of your support system here on stateside. Um, um, one of the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.930
 other things you should do is make sure that you have all your financial,

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.440
 uh, situations in order. Those are the things that I believe you

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.950
 should do when you are selected to move overseas.
