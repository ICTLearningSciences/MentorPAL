00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.610
How do I spend most of my time at work? Most of my time at work is spent

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.370
 walking the deck plates, walking the non osk, walking around, talking

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.130
 to my sailors, um, finding out if there are any issues good, bad

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.900
 or indifferent. Um, I like to have conversations with my sailors.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.660
 So and for me, that's how I spend most of my time at work. Um, this

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.420
 is how I get to know them both on a professional and personal level,

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.180
 walking through their different areas, different departments having

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.940
 conversations, um, sitting down, talking to them about family, talking

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.700
 to them about their careers. Some to me, it's more or less like

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.470
 a just a common place instead of having them sit in my office where

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.230
 it's a little bit more professional. So that's what I That's how I spend

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.990
 most of my time at work walking around and I'm talking to my sales
