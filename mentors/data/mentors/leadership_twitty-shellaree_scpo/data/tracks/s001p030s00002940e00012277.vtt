00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.780
some of the signs that we should look for. That might mean that there's

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:12.710
 discrimination after a sexual harassment or sexual assault. Reporting

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.640
 is, um, sailors, um, not being included. And you see exclusion,

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.570
 Uh, maybe different, uh, behaviors of the sailors who did not make the

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.500
 report, But they know what happened. Um, other issues would be from

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.430
 a leadership aspect. If the evils are written differently and you

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.360
 have to go in and speak on behalf of the sailor, um, these were some

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.290
 of the different, uh, behaviors that you can, uh, see if there's,

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.220
 ah, discrimination.
