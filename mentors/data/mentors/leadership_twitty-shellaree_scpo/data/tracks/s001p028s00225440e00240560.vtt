00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.780
managing career and family effectively is a challenge. You want to be

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:12.720
 great at both, or at least do them to the best of your ability. Um,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.650
 there has to be a balance. As I was coming up as a junior sailor in

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.580
 the Navy, I had a mentor who always explained to me that, uh, work life

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:30.520
 balance is what's important. And I live by that now, understanding

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:36.450
 that my work, it is very important. That's how I pay my bills, how

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.380
 I feed my Children and how I take care of myself. And my life is is,

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:48.320
 uh, split between the two, my work and my family, Um, work life balance.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.250
 Having the balance to be able to take care of my Children and

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.180
 be able to be a great leader in this organization is important. So

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.120
 I believe that the work life balance, um, has toe work, and it encompasses

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:12.050
 everything that I do, um, in my life
