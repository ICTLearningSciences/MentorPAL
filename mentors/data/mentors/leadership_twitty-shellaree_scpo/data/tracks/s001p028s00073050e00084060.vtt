00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.240
one of the best approaches for selecting a new duty station. Um, would

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.630
 be to understand the position of the detailer and to, uh, make sure

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.030
 that the detailer knows what your preferences our preferences are.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:22.420
 Um, some of us have families. Some of us are single. Um, and the detailer,

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.810
 um, understands that and knows that so one of the best approach

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.200
 to me would be to make sure that you're communicating with your detailer

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.600
 and communicating often. Um, sometimes you could be put in a

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.990
 place where, um it may not be a great fit. However, the detailer, um,

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.380
 we'll have a conversation with you. And although you may not think

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.770
 it's a perfect fit, it may have to be ah fit for you at that time.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.170
 Um, making sure that you communicate with your detailer and communicate

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.560
 often is one of the best approach is, uh, for choosing a new place.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.950
 Thio, do your job
