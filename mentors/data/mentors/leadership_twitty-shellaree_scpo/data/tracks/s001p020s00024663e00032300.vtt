even how I get to the root of a problem with the team member communication

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.970
 conversation. Carrie. Those three things are so important. The

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:19.040
 first thing I would do is pull them away from the team. Ask questions,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.100
 My favorite questions. The five W's who, what, where, when, why that

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:31.160
 will enable them to express themselves and find out what is going

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.220
 on working.
