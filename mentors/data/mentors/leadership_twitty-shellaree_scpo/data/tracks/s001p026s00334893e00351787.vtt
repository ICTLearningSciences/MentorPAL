If I could change one thing about my job, it would probably be training.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:12.710
 For example, as the SCL, we first come into this job sitting in the

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.640
 seat, not knowing anything, especially for me, Someone who has never

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.570
 been the S e l of a reserve center. If I could change one thing

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.500
 about that, it would be the training. The training should start after,

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.430
 uh, sitting in the seat. I believe that I should learn the job for

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.360
 us or we should learn the job first and then send us to the training.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.280
 That way we would understand what the position is about. Um, I've

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.210
 been at this SCL job for about two years now, and when I first came

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.140
 on board, I went straight to training. I didn't understand what I

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.070
 was learning, but now that I'm here, I feel that this would be a better

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.000
 time for me to go to the training. So I understand the acronyms

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.930
 that they use the words that they, uh and phrases that they use. So

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.860
 for me, if I could do anything and and change anything about my job,

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.790
 it will be the way we're trained to do the job
