WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.860
One of the great things about being in this organization is that we get

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:12.880
 to travel all over the world. Different commands, different ships,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.890
 uh, things like that. Sometimes you may end up at a place where you're

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.910
 not happy or it wasn't a good fit. If that's the case, the first

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.920
 thing you should do is seek out a mentor having a mentor to get you

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.940
 through, maybe the the not so good fit or, uh, a place where you're

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.950
 not comfortable and you're having challenges. Um, it's good to have

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.970
 someone to speak to to talk about it. Um, that way you're able to do

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.980
 a good job to be efficient and to help somebody motivate you when

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.000
 you really didn't feel like you were part of this team or or organization.
