Why do people leave the Navy? There are many reasons why people leave

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.090
 the Navy. It's either. Their time is up. 20 years, 20 to 30. It's time

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.710
 for them to go. They may want to do something different, go to school

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.330
 without being in the Navy. They may want to start a family. There

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.950
 are so many reasons why a person wants to leave the Navy. The first

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.570
 thing we should do when a person decides that they really want to

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.190
 leave the Navy is sit down with them and have a conversation, Um, a

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.810
 career development board, um, or just a simple conversation and ask

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:51.430
 why. But at the end of the day is their decision on why they want to

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:57.050
 leave the Navy.
