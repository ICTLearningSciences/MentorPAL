00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.790
the behaviors that, um I think are allowed in every organization is the

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:12.740
 use of foul language. Um, I've been the foul language use because,

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.680
 um, it's not appropriate in a professional setting. Um, what you do

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.630
 at home in the, you know, privacy of your own home. Um, that's okay.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.570
 But when you come toe work and your around your seniors and your juniors,

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.520
 um, it's important to speak professionally and not use the the

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.460
 use of profanity and foul language. It's unprofessional, and majority

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.410
 of the time is, uh, inappropriate. So I I I've been the use of

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.350
 foul language.
