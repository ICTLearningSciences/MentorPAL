before you deploy some of the things that you should do before to get

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.550
 ready is make sure that you are in constant contact with the command

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.900
 that you're leaving from, um, paying attention to your check off list,

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.260
 making sure that all your financial and medical documentation are

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.610
 in order. Um, communicating often with your family, explaining to

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.960
 them what the process is and what to expect while you're gone. Those

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.310
