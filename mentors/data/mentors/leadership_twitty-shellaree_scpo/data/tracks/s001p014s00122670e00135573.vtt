00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.410
to have a balance with being close to your team and then being considered

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.980
 fraternization. Um, that were balanced. It is a big word. Um, for

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.540
 me, I'm very hands on. I like to get down down on the same level with

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:23.110
 my sailors, and I think setting the tone in the beginning of what

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.670
 your expectation is and how they see you and how they respect you.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.240
 When you are down with them in the trenches and you're giving them

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.800
 tasks and things like that, I think they will. They understand. And

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.360
 then that balance of being close, uh, getting into their personal lives,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.930
 maybe having to go on and pick up a a gallon of milk for them and

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.490
 take it to their homes. Um, you have to think about the balance on

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:02.060
 Dad. Ask yourself questions. You know, Would this be considered? You

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:07.620
 know, uh, maybe too close. Fraternization. Um, questioning yourself,

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.190
 asking yourself those questions may be talking to somebody else

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.750
 about it, but just remembering that there is a balance of being too

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.320
 close and then getting, um, deep into maybe the personal aspects of

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.880
 things
