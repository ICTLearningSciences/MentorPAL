00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.720
my work day changed day to day. Just a little bit. I was here, Silas,

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.580
 um, before I joined the Navy and a mother, um, the day to date, uh,

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.450
 challenges as a hair stylist was I was busy all the time. I was one

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:24.310
 of the top hairstylists at a J. C. Penney's, um, and then I transitioned

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:30.180
 into the navy, and the day to day is still the same. The only difference

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.050
 is I'm not doing hair. I'm serving sailors, uh, and officers,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.910
 um, long hours sometimes and still physical. Um, and basically,

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.780
 like I said, just taking care of sailors. That's basically what I what

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.640
 I do. I've done that. The hours haven't really changed that much.
