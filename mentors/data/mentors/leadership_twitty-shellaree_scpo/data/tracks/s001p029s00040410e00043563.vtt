00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.350
when moving to a new location. Some of the things you should prioritize

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.860
 in the neighborhood is, um, the rules of the community, the rules

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.360
 of the neighborhood. Um, if they have a watch program, um, how far are

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.870
 the schools? How far are the Fire Department and the hospitals, especially

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.370
 if you have Children? Those were some of the things that I

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.880
 would think of when prioritizing where you live in different neighborhoods.
