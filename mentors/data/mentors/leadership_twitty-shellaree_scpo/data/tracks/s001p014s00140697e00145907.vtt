 to make mistakes. And those mistakes are going to help them be a better

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:23.180
 leader. You have to learn from your mistakes. Um, that it's okay

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:30.620
 to fail. Um, you know, being a new leader is a challenge in itself.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:45.510
