00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.570
in this organization, it's inevitable. There are going to be some bumps

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:12.290
 in the road both professionally and personally. Early in my career,

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:18.020
 I had a bump in the road and, uh, I had to go to a d r B, a disciplinary

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.740
 review board. That's where you stand in front of the chiefs of

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.460
 your command and they ask you questions, fact finding questions. Um,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.180
 what I learned from that is that we're all going to make mistakes

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.900
 and that there are people here that care about you, and because of

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.630
 that, you can get through it. Um, there are There are chiefs who wanna

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:52.350
 help you. There are petty officers who want to help you, and there

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.070
 are commanding officers and executive officers who want to help you.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.790
 So while there are bumps in the roads and things that happen, there

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.510
 is gonna always be somebody there. Thio talk you through it, uh,

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.230
 give you different tools to help you work through it. I like I was saying

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.960
 early in my career I had to go to a D r B because I was late for

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.680
 work. Um, I was on the ship at that time, and you could never, ever

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.400
 miss ships movement. Um, and I didn't go to mass, but I did go to

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.120
 DRB, and it was devastating. And at that time, sometimes when you have

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.840
 a bump in the road, people see you differently. But coming to work,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.570
 uh, doing better? Um, you know, asking questions, getting help,

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.290
 maybe talking to someone, your chaplain or counseling things like that

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.010
 that could help you also get through those things. And that was one

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.730
 of the things I had to do. I was late for work and for personal reasons.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.450
 And my lpo. She helped me by offering counseling and chaplains

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.180
 services so you can get through the bumps in the road. You just have

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.900
 to make sure that you're you're willing thio, ask for help and,

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.620
 uh, receive the help as well.
