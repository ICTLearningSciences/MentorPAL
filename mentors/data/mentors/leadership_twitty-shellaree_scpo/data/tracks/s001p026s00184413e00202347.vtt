00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.820
So here at the reserve center, sometimes our work can be boring and it

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.780
 could be monotonous. We are at a reserve center, and a lot of the things

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.750
 that we do is repetition. Uh, taking care of our reservists taking

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.720
 care of our sailors taking care of ourselves. We do on a everyday

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.680
 basis. And it could be very boring on monotonous. Some of the things

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.650
 that we do, uh, here at the mosque or the reserve center when we

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.620
 are in a boring situation or a monotonous situation, Um, I will get

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.590
 on the loudspeaker and I'll say, Hey, everybody is time for a huddle

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.550
 and we meet on the quarter deck at the Reserve Center and we talk

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.520
 about what? What are some of the boring things that we're doing right

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.490
 now? What are some of the monotonous things that we're doing? And

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.450
 we have a conversation, and then we plan to get the work done at a in

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.420
 a timely manner, and that will help take some of the boring and the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.390
 monotony out of it. Um, it sounds funny or may even sound weird, but

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.350
 it works. We don't do it often, but some days when we're at that

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.320
 point where we're over the top with this monotonous work, we meet in

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.290
 a huddle and have a conversation, and then after we're done talking

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.260
 about it, we go back to our spaces and the work is done, uh, in an

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.220
 efficient manner, and they're more motivated to get it done because

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.190
 we had, like, this little football huddle.
