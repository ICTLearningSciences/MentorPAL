Yeah, I prepare my team in the beginning for arduous mission or a tough

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.050
 mission by first setting the tone, setting the expectation, um, explaining

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.650
 to them what's getting ready to happen, you know, getting their

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.250
 feedback of you know, what they can do, how we can do it, how we

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.850
 can get to the to the end goal. But in the beginning, it they have

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.450
 to know what's going on. So setting the expectation, having the conversation.
