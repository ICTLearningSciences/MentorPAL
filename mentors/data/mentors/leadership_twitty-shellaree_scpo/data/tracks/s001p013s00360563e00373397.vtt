00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.370
so I have moved a few times in the Navy. Um, I started out in Akron, Ohio,

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.890
 from Akron, Ohio. I went to Ingleside, Texas, from Texas to Jacksonville,

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:17.410
 from Jacksonville to Great Lakes, Great Lakes to Bethesda,

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.930
 Maryland, from Maryland to here in California. Some of the things

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.460
 I realized with moving and having Children is that the expectation is

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.980
 we expect our Children to adjust. Um, like we adjust. Sometimes that's

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.500
 not the case. Um, So I have six Children, five boys and one girl,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.020
 most of them when I transferred to different locations, they went

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.540
 with me, and the expectation is they'll get it. They're resilient,

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.060
 and for the most part, they are. But I think the biggest challenge was

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.580
 wanting them to, uh, adjust quickly. Um, and those were some challenges.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:07.100
 Now, once they're here and and and they get acclimated with

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.630
 the different areas, then just like their mom, they don't meet a stranger,

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.150
 so they get in and they fit in. But I think that was one of some

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.670
 of the biggest challenges. Was one of my Children to adjust quickly
