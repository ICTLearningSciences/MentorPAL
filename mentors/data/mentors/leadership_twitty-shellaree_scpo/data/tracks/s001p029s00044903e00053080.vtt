right. Choosing where you live on base or off base has a lot to do with

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.780
 your command and the rank of your rank. So if you are an E four and

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.750
 below and you are on a ship and you are single majority of the time,

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.720
 you will stay on the ship or base housing. Um, if you are in the

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.690
 area, if the area does not have a base housing, you are authorized to

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.650
 live off the base, but it also has a lot to do with your rank as well.
