00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.660
here at my command when things don't go well or well, the way we planned

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.470
 them. Um, some of the things that we can utilize is, uh, conversations,

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:18.280
 team meetings, um, sitting down and planning and working on how

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:24.090
 how we can fix it or how we can make it better. Um, it is so important.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.910
 Thio have that conversation. Um, in this organization, nothing

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.720
 is. Nothing is perfect. So we have toe work at, uh, doing things better?

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.530
 Um, s o I just believe that having conversations on day, finding

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.340
 out what we could do, better having a plan that would help us, um,

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.150
 make things better.
