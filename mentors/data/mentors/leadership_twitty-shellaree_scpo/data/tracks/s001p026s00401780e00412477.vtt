00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.940
at this time. Covert 19 has a lot of uncertainty. Um, we are all as leaders

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:13.030
 put in different situations with this as faras updating policies.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:19.110
 There are a lot of new policies that come out, um, every day on

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.200
 were having meetings about cove it and how we deal with our sailors

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.290
 and each other. Um, as leaders, sometimes we have to have those uncomfortable

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:37.380
 conversations. And because of that, uh, things like co vid

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.470
 and personal situations, um, come with conversations with the leadership

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.560
 that you may have thio say things and help advise them on things

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.640
 that may not be, um, taken in a positive manner. But you have to

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.730
 have a ethical behavior, ethical thought about those things Onda conversations

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.820
 have to be had.
