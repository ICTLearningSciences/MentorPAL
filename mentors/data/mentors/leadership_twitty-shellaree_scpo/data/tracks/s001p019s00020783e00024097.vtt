00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.370
what I need to know about my team members are yeah, um, what's important

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.900
 to you? As far as being part of a team, there are some people who

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.420
 can't work in a team environment. So one thing I would want to know

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.940
 is what's important to you when working with a team when being part

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:28.470
 of a team. Um, that would be some one thing that I would actually ask.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.990
 Yeah.
