00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.360
okay, if I could advise you to take a lesson from your leadership school

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.880
 and apply it to your real life, One thing I would advise is take

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.390
 one or two things that you've learned. Um, and use it. Um, you're gonna

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.910
 learn a lot of different things, a lot of different skills. Ah,

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.420
 lot of different, uh, trainings in your leadership school. And it may

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.940
 be overwhelming, but take one or two things that you think that would

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.450
 be important to you And use that in your your personal life and

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.960
 your everyday life. Um, for example, if the one thing that you learned

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.480
 waas being able to communicate by asking one question, a personal

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.990
 question or a professional question take that one thing. And if it

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:01.510
 works for you as the individual, use that one thing to help you in your

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.020
 home life
