00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.010
when someone has the risk of suicide. Um, for me, the first thing I would

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:13.170
 do is as soon as I realized that I want to get someone involved

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.340
 right away, Um, whether it be the chaplain, um, the suicide hotline,

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.500
 the suicide coordinator, um, fleeting family services and or military

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.660
 one source. The conversation, um, has to be had, and the resource

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.820
 is have to be implemented right away. So any time at the start of any

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.990
 risk factors or thoughts of suicide, getting someone involved right

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:50.150
 away is very important.
