00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.110
of course. So a little trick I used to keep stress from boiling over is

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:13.380
 to first say, Can we revisit that? And then I will immediately walk

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.640
 away and go to my safe place. And normally, my safe place is my office,

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.900
 and I will close the door, and I I will meditate, maybe call someone.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.170
 Um But I have quiet and I will have quiet time if I'm not meditating

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:38.430
 or speaking to someone. One of my favorite tricks that I used

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.690
 to distress is to be quiet. Um, it's important. Um, I have to allow

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.960
 my thoughts thio, uh, to maybe not consume me. Um, but to listen

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.220
 to them and then I reflect by journaling.
