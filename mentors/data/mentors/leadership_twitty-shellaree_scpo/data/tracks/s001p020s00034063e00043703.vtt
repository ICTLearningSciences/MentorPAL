Well, you know, being the leader is important to me, e love sharing all

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:14.950
 of my experiences and, uh, being part of teams empowering people.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:22.000
 And I get asked a lot when is breaking the rules. Okay? And I just have

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.050
 to be honest, It's never Okay. It's never okay to break the rules.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:36.100
 Breaking the rules said something about who you are as a person.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:43.150
 Is there something about your character? All right, So for me as a leader,

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:50.200
 um, as a, um, senior enlisted leader who empowers others, breaking

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:57.250
 the rules is never okay.
