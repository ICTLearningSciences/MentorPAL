00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.860
So one of the major negatives doing this work is questioning myself to

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:12.870
 see if I'm actually doing what's good for the sailor, um, wanting them

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.890
 to succeed Mawr than they want it for themselves. That is one of

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.900
 the, I believe, one of the negative things for doing this kind of work.
