WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.770
recently, I received a phone call, uh, to return to one of my favorite

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.700
 jobs in this organization. Um, I was at one point in my career. I was

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.620
 an R D C. And I worked for RTC Great Lakes. I just received a phone

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:24.550
 call to travel back to RTC because they're looking for senior chiefs

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.470
 and amazing leaders and people who have done the job. Right now,

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.400
 I consider that a big conflict because, um, at the time that I was

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.320
 there, I was married. I had more help with family and, uh, things of

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.240
 that nature. Now I'm single and, uh, moving back to RTC and being in

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.170
 our d. C would, uh, conflict with a lot of things going on in my younger

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.090
 son's life. Um, while I I understand the mission and understand

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.020
 what I'm supposed to do in this organization, I have tow, think about

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.940
 family. We have to think about family when your family is involved

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.860
 in your moves. Um, two different locations. It's very important.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.790
 And it would be, uh, a big conflict if I was to move back to RTC and

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.710
 being a single mother and having a child who is in his high school

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.640
 years, um, playing football and in the band and different things like

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.560
 that because I wouldn't be able to be a part of his, uh, his high

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.490
 school years. So to me, that is a serious conflict, one of which that

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.410
 I am not willing thio endure.
