00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.840
a couple of common mistakes that new leaders make is showing up to a command,

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.830
 jumping into fast, not getting the pulse of the of the command

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.820
 of the staff, not getting to know, uh, the regiment of the organization

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.810
 first before doing the job. Um, it's important that you get to

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.800
 know people first, find out how things are run at the at the at the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.790
 job, and I believe that's anywhere. So I think that's, uh, important.
