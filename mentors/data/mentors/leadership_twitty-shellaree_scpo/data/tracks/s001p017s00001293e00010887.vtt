00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.440
sharing personal stories and your emotions and being vulnerable in front

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.040
 of your team. Sometimes you don't know when to do it. I know, for

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.630
 example, for me showing up to my first job in the beginning. You wanna

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.230
 get to know everyone? Um, and I think after you get to know people,

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.820
 that's when you're able to share your stories. Um, you have to know

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.410
 somebody before you could tell your story. Or you might share your

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.010
 story before you get to know them. Maybe that will help bring about

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.600
 a change or growth, Um, or an understanding in the beginning With

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.200
 that person, it just all depends. I believe it's at at different times

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.790
 in different levels.
