00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.290
Hello. My name is Senior Chief Celery Twitty. I've been in the Navy for

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.730
 19 years. I'm actually stationed at Naval Operational Support Center,

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.160
 San Jose in California. My job here is to help sailors, something

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.600
 I've always loved to do. I have six Children, five boys and one girl

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.040
 and a granddaughter. I came in the Navy in Akron, Ohio, As a reservist.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.480
 I did two years of reserve time after I did my reserve time.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.920
 It was your 9 11. I went to boot camp in October. In boot camp. I did

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.360
 everything I was supposed to do. Graduated and from there on, I came

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.790
 back home and they re called me the active duty because of 9 11.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.230
 What that mean was I was at the reserve center taking care of sailors

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.670
 ordering different supplies for them. I realized I want to do something

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.110
 different. So I went after duty, full time support. After coming

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.550
 on as an active duty sailor, I went to a ship in Ingleside, Texas.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.980
 I was on the ship for three years. As a culinary specialist, I realized

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.420
 I wanted to change my rate to something different as well. So

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.860
 that's one of my commanding officer told me. He said, If you pass on

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.300
 your inspections outside, off on you, to change your rate took hospital

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.740
 Cormack. And that's exactly what I did from hospital. From from

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.180
 leaving the ship, I went directly to hospital course school. That's

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.610
 where I was the second class and hospital course school. I left there

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.050
 and went to our D. C. I went to Great Lakes, one of my favorite jobs

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.490
 being in our d. C. I went there like I said in the beginning, as

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.930
 a second class from there, I made first very quickly, and I left Great

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.370
 Lakes as a chief, which is one of the greatest milestones in my

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.810
 life. I am now here at Naval Operational Support Center here in San

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.240
 Jose, California and I am the senior enlisted leader. I spent a lot

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.680
 of time taking care of sailors taking care of my commanding officer

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.120
 and my excel
