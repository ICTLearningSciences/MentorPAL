00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.330
the most challenging part about my job is being an advisor. Um, I love

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.810
 my position, but at some points in my position, I realized that I have

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:17.280
 to have uncomfortable conversations with my sailors. I have to have

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.760
 uncomfortable conversations with the triad. And at the end of the

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.240
 day, my CEO, um, he makes the final decision. For example, I had a

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.720
 sailor who, uh, may have potentially, um, been around someone who has

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.200
 cove it at this time. Right now, we are in this cove it situation

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.670
 with with this disease and being in the military, we have to be really

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.150
 careful with that s So I did have a sailor who was around someone

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.630
 who tested positive for Cove It on and he came toe work and let us

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.110
 know that hey was in that area while he was there. He was also told

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.590
 that everyone had been tested and it came back negative. I did advise

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.060
 the triad that, um it's important for us to let everyone else know.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.540
 I was also told that we he didn't want to alarm anyone and because

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.020
 the test came back negative. But the bigger picture is that everyone

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.500
 should know who is in the area with someone who has, uh, tested positive

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.970
 for Covic. Attend of the day. I did advise my commanding officer

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.450
 about, uh, that situation. He did change his mind, um, and did

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.930
 allow me to put it out to the rest of the sailors. But I realized the

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.410
 challenging part for me is no matter what at the at the end of every

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.890
 conversation, at the end of every situation that I advise him on,

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.360
 he is the deciding factor. And I have to carry out the mission. Um,

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.840
 and e have to carry out the mission sometimes with no questions asked.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.320
 Um, and that could be a challenge for me.
