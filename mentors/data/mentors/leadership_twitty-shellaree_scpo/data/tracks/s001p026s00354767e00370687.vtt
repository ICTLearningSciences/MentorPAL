00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.510
okay. One of the things that I believe was a big weakness of mine. Waas

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:12.160
 being organized. I have a way that I like to do things. And, uh, sometimes

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.820
 I feel like I'm all over the place And one of the things that

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.480
 I've learned, especially being in this leadership position and sitting

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.140
 in this seat as the s e l. One of the things that I've learned

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.790
 is that in order for you to be successful, you have to be organized.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.450
 And the way I've learned to do that is to write down everything. Um,

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:46.110
 five years ago, I learned about journaling, and I started to journal

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.760
 and the journal Lean carried over into all aspects of my life, and

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.420
 it actually helped me to organize my thoughts and, um, toe organize

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.080
 how I want to present things. Um, when I'm dealing with my commanding

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.740
 officer, when I'm dealing with my sailors or even when I'm dealing

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.390
 with my family. So that is one of the things that I feel that I

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.050
 was may have been weak at and my organizational skills. Okay,
