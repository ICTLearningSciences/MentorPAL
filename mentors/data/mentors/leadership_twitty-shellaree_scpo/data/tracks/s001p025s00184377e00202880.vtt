00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.380
the failures that I am most unhappy about, um, majority of the time. For

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.910
 me, it's my, uh it's personal. Um, and professional, I have a, for

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.430
 example, coming up in the ranks, and this organization, you know,

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.960
 came in the Navy kind of late in age and motivated as a sailor. But

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.490
 I had a couple of people who thought my my job performance and everything

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.020
 was amazing. But my administrative skills were not up to par.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.550
 And I guess hearing that, um, from somebody of, ah, higher ranking than

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.070
 you, um, it makes you feel like you're a failure. Um, administratively.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.600
 So you you have those those questions, those conversations about

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.130
 your failures and what your weaknesses and things are. And one

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.660
 of those is administrative for me, And it made me second guess it made

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.180
 me question myself. Um, but at the end of the day, I've learned from

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.710
 it, Um, and but that's Ah, that's a failure for me to a point where

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.240
 I, um when I start something, for example, working on, uh, packages

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.770
 for, uh, map meritorious advancement program. When I'm working on

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.300
 a package, I start to ask myself, um, am I doing this right administratively

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.820
 are the words correct? Does this sentence make sense? Does

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.350
 this paragraph makes sense? I second guess myself and to me, um, self

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.880
 sabotage is kind of like a failure.
