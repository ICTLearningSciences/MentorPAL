00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.290
my home life was pretty well, I say normal, but what's normal these days?

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.740
 Um growing up with a single mom, Um, my brothers and I and my sister

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.180
 We grew up with my great grandmother and my mother and life was

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.630
 great, but I think it was different because at a young age, my father,

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.070
 our father was killed. And I remember that I remember just shuras

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.510
 It was yesterday s O. While we had a normal childhood, my mother went

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.960
 through a lot of different things. A different emotional things

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.400
 because of my father getting killed when we were young. So normal, but

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.840
 kind of sad as well, kind of emotional. My brothers and sister and

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.290
 I we we did everything normal like everyone else. We went to school,

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.730
 went to church, sang in the choir, and we were very active in sports.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.180
 But it was a little emotional for my mom because of my father being

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.620
 killed when we were really young
