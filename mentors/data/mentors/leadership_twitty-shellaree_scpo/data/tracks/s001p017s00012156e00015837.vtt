00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.110
council skills that are important. The most important one for me is listening.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.360
 It is it's very important to listen when you are sitting down

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.620
 counseling someone, um, most of time. I think people just want, want,

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.880
 want to be heard. So I think it's important to listen, um and then

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.140
 wait to give your feedback or your thought process on what, um,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.390
 they need. But the most important when count listening and sitting down

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.650
 within a counseling session is listening.
