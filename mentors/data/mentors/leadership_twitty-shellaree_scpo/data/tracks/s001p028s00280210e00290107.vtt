00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.760
when moving some things that could fall through the cracks. Um, would

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.680
 be not really paying attention to your list of the moving authority.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.590
 Sometimes they put a lot of different things on your list. And if you

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.510
 don't pay attention once you get to your new location, you may have

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.420
 missed something. Uh, those were some of the things that could fall

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.340
 through the cracks. Um, uniforms, making sure that you are aware

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.250
 of keeping your uniforms with you as opposed to putting them on the

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.160
 moving truck. Those were some of the things that, uh, it slips your

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.080
 mind, and then you you have to show up to your command and dress blues,

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.990
 and you have your dress whites or you have your type threes. Those

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.910
 are some of the things that fall through the cracks. Um, not remembering

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.820
 the things that you really need upon arrival
