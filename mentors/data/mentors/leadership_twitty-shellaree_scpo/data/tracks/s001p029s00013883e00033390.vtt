00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.600
when I first joined the Navy, have a station in Akron, Ohio. It was a

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.360
 great place. It was my hometown. The second place was Ingleside, Texas.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.110
 I was actually on a ship. Uh, it was the weather was nice. And the

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.860
 ship life was different for me. Um, but it actually added to who

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.620
 I am today. Um, the other place that I've been was Naval Operational

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:35.370
 Support Center, Jacksonville, Florida. A very big city with lots of

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.120
 things to do. I was stationed at a clinic there in Jacksonville. I

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.880
 learned a lot, and it was, um, very motivating. The next place was RTC

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.630
 Great Lakes on Guy was in our D. C there. Um, the job was amazing.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:58.390
 It was very empowering the weather. There was terrible, very cold.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.140
 Summers were amazing, but the cold when it was cold, it was very cold.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.890
 Um, from there I was in station it, uh, you met the Bureau of Medicine

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.650
 and Surgery in Falls Church, Virginia. Uh, and I lived in Maryland.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.400
 Amazing place on one of the reasons being was, uh I lived in

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.150
 an area where there were a lot of affluent people and motivating people

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.910
 and my kids love the area as well. Um, now the president, I am station

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.660
 in San Jose, California Um, a beautiful, beautiful area. Very

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.410
 expensive, but a beautiful area. The reserve center. It hasn't a lot

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:50.170
 amazing people on day. I'm learning a lot as far as my job goes, but

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.920
 the area is very expensive.
