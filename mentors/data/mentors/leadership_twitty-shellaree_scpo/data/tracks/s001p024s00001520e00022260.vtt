00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:12.430
I help morale by, uh, encouraging conversation or and or ah, Fun Day.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:24.010
 So we're not able to, for example, were not able to leave and go home

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:35.600
 right away, but we can take a break. So, um, I have a time where the

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:47.180
 sailors or the team, they have the little, um, paintball guns, and

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:58.760
 we take maybe an hour and we set up bottles and we allow the sailors

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:10.340
 or the team to just shoot the bottles. Who can shoot the most bottles

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:21.920
 down? Um, it breaks up the time a little bit. It breaks up the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:33.500
 monotony on bare, all having fun, having a little bit of friendly competition.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:45.090
 Competition. That's how I see, uh, adding to the morale,

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:56.670
 Especially when you can't go home after a long day and you have to complete

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:08.250
 the job or the mission. Right? All right. Mhm. Yes. Yeah.
