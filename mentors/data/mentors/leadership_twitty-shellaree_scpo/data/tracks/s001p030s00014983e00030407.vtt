00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.040
what I do when I am giving sailors a failure evaluation is, um everything

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.220
 starts with a package. Ah, paper package or or a conversation? Andi,

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:19.410
 when you're looking at the sailor, when you're looking at the package

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.600
 that the paper package that is representing the sailor you make

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.780
 sure that you are selecting, choosing, um, having the conversation

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:37.970
 about the best sailor for the position, the job? Um um or for any

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:44.160
 possibilities of doing, um, the job, making sure that yeah, you are

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.340
 selecting the best person. Or like I said, having the conversation about

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.530
 the best person not using, um, uh, their behavior or anything like

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.720
 that, making sure that you are being honest first with yourself

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.900
 and being honest with the conversation that you're having about the

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.090
 same sailor.
