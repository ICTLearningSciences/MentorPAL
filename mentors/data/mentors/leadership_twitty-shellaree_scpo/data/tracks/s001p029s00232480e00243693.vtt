When you are traveling in this organization on your first arrival to your

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.150
 new command, you are signing up for a G T. C C. It's a government

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.310
 travel credit card. Um, that is how you traveled now going to different

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:21.460
 trainings. I'm going to different schools. You use your government

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.610
 travel card. Um, once it is opened, um, you sign off on it just

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.760
 like a regular credit credit card. And when you're due to go to training

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.920
 or travel, they open the your command. They will open it up, allowed

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.070
 to use it for however long you're gone. When you come back from

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.220
 travel, you turn in all your receipts, all your paperwork, and then

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.370
 they turn the card off so that you can't use it for anything else.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.520
 One of the other things they use when you are traveling. In order

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.680
 to use that government travel card, you have to sign a page 13 saying

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.830
 that you would only use it for travel and food purposes, and then

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.980
 you will not use it for anything else.
