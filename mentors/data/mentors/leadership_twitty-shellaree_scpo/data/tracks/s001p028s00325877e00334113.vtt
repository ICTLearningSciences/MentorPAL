00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.150
one of the best plans to utilize Um, if there's an emergency when your

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.440
 family member is away on deployment or overseas is to utilize the command.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.740
 When the when the family member first checks out of the command,

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.030
 one of the most important things is to meet the triad, the commanding

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:27.330
 officer of the XO and the S E A. L. If the emergency is above

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.620
 their level, then the next thing you would do is reach out to the American

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:37.920
 Red Cross and they will make sure that you're in. You're able

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.210
 to get in touch with your family member that is deployed.
