00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.370
my work on a typical day starts with coming in in the morning. Put in

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.880
 my uniform or opening up my computer, checking to see the emails, uh,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.400
 checking my emails. And then that's when I start to walk. The PNA's

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.910
 going to my different departments, finding out what the plan of the

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.430
 day for them is, what they have on their agenda, what needs to get

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.940
 accomplished. And I do that for all of my departments. And then after

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.460
 that, I circled back to my office, put everything on a note pad after

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.970
 I go through emails a second time. Um and then it's time to start

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.490
 my meeting with my commanding officer and my executive officer. After

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:56.000
 I let them know, let the triad know what the sailors have on their

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.520
 agenda. The meeting is adjourned. I come back to my office and then

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.030
 I just start executing the plan of the day. Um, making sure that

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.550
 my sailors were taken care of, um, that I am taking care of going through

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.060
 emails, uh, answering questions, answering questions from, um

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.580
 you know, others, uh, outside of the command
