00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.600
There are all kinds of sailors that are part of your team. Um, one sailor

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.360
 that causes problems in a team. Um, our sailors, who maybe are unhappy,

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.110
 Um, disgruntled, uh, a sailor who is maybe ready to get out.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.860
 Their time is up. Um, and they may bring unhappiness to the team. How

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.610
 would I handle that? I I do believe in inclusion, including everybody,

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.370
 even the ones that don't wanna be a part of something. So I have

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.120
 to communicate. I have to speak to that sailor. I have to sit them

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.870
 down and ask them, Um, what's going on? How can I help you? Um, how

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.620
 do you see yourself being a part of the team, or do you even see yourself

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.380
 being part of the team? So in order to help someone, you have

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:04.130
 to communicate with them. We don't know their story. We don't know

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:09.880
 what happened the day before or the day. Or maybe that moment. So maybe

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.630
 they're going through something. So the biggest thing is to communicate.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.390
 I have a sailor right now who, um, is struggling Thio be a

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.140
 part of the team? Um, he's unhappy. Um, he's ready to get out the Navy.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.890
 And you know that cliche. One bad apple spoils the bunch. It's

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.640
 not always true. You could tell the ones that are unhappy and he is

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.400
 unhappy. And I just sat down with him today and I explained why I I

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.150
 just sat down with him and just asking the question of what's going

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.900
 on. He explained it. And while you think it's supposed to spill over

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.650
 into everyone else, it almost did. But it didn't. And one conversation,

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.410
 just one conversation, and he feels better, so I just believe in

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:13.160
 order. Thio, help someone get through that you have a conversation.
