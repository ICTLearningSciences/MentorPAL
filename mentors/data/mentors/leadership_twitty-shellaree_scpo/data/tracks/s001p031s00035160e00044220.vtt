00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.170
when we are dealing with a sailor who has lost a family member or lost

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.500
 a peer or friend do thio death? Um, the way we should deal with them

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.820
 is to allow them to grieve. Um, there are different areas of the command.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.150
 Um, like I said, suicide awareness training, but allowing them

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.470
 to grieve with maybe having them, uh, to have a day off to take some

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.800
 time? Um they are. If they have leave, we can put them on leave

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:45.120
 so they could take some days Thio grieve and then setting them up definitely

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.450
 with counseling and chaplains services.
