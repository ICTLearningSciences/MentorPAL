00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.580
problems. Ah, problem that needs to be fixed early. Um, that you may not

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.320
 be able to fix later is micromanaging. And one of the reasons why

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.050
 is because when you are micromanaging, you don't give the sailor or

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.780
 the person enough time to thio. You don't empower them enough to do

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.510
 the job themselves. They'll just figure, you know, Well, you're telling

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.250
 me what to do, so I'll just do it your way, and they're not ableto

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.980
 think outside the box and do it themselves.
