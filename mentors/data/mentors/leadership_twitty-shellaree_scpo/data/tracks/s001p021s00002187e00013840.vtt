if you ever have a situation where your priorities, um don't agree with

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.610
 the chain of command. Um, as a senior enlisted leader, I've had some

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.980
 situations where my priorities did not agree with the chain of command

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.360
 or my upper ranking chain of command. Um, the first thing that

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.740
 always has toe happen is a conversation. Because I am in that upper

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:39.120
 chain. It's easy for me to have those conversations. I'll say, Hey,

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.490
 sir, Um, Hey, ma'am, Um, Hey, Master Chief, can we sit and have a conversation

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:51.870
 for a junior sailor? It is a must. You have that conversation

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.250
 as well. However, the way to get to that, you have to start with

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.630
 requesting asking your lpo uh, your senior chief, your master Chief,

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:11.000
 if you can, uh, request a meeting so that you can, um, express your

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.380
 feelings and concerns about the, uh, the situation
