00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.590
I started in the Navy in 2000 and 1 March of 2001. It's funny. I remember

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.330
 that day as well. I joined the Navy because I wanted to do something

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.070
 different. I was back then. I was a wife and a mother. Um and I

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.810
 wanted to do something different. I did. I was a hairstylist asses

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.550
 well, and I was a personal trainer, and one day my cousin came over

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.280
 and said she was going to sign up, and, um, she took me with her. Unfortunately,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.020
 she was going to the Air Force. She wanted me to go with

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.760
 her, but the Air Force wouldn't take me. But they gave me the information

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.500
 about the Navy, and that's when I started. Signed on that dotted

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.240
 line took the as Bob raised my right hand, and here I am, 19 years

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.980
 later,
