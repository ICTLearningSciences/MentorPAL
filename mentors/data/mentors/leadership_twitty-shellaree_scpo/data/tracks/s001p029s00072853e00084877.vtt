00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.020
when owning a home or deciding to rent a home. Um, it starts with, uh,

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.190
 maybe sitting down with a financial advisor. Um, at your command, you

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:19.370
 will always have someone of a representative with a financial advisor.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:25.540
 Um, making sure that you have money set aside for either buying

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:31.710
 a home or renting. I know, For example, some areas, um, like California.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.880
 If you decide to rent, they want first month's rent and last

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:44.060
 month's rent and a security deposit. So you wanna make sure that you

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:50.230
 are able to afford, uh, both of those, Um, for example, if your rent

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.400
 in this area is 2700, they want $2700 upfront and the $2700 for your

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.570
 last month's rent and a $500 deposit, so you have to be able to know

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.750
 that you can afford that. So you would sit down with a financial

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.920
 advisor to help you decide if renting is going to be better for you,

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.090
 or if buying a home is going to be better for you.
