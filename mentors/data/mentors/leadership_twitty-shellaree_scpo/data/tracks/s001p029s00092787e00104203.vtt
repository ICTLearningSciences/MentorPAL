00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.550
on a naval base. Some of the things that are easy to find our your MTs,

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:12.260
 your medical treatment facilities, your commissaries, those air like

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.960
 your grocery stores, gas stations. Um, if you are on a large enough

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.670
 base, there are sometimes hospitals. Um, some of the things that

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.370
 aren't so hard to find or that may not be easy to find would be, um

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:35.080
 your resource is for maybe going to college. Ah, lot of things have

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.780
 changed in the recent years as far as going to school, so you would

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.490
 have to find those things online. Um, another thing that would be hard

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:52.190
 to find would be different. Resource is for counseling and things

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.900
 like that. Um, you would also have to find those online because a lot

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.600
 of the bases are, um, kind of downsizing. Um, some of those areas

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.310
 of counseling and things like that in college are moving off base,

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.010
 so you'd have to do your research on those things
