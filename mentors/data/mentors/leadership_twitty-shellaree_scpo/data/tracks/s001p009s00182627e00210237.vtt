00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.230
in any organization or just, uh, and in a personal, uh, life boundaries

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.620
 have to be set. Um, I actually read a book about boundaries and set

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.000
 in your boundaries. Boundaries are important. Um, I know for me, I

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.380
 am a very, um, affectionate person. I am a very touchy person, and

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.760
 I realized everyone is not like that. And so you have to be able to

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.150
 sit down with someone, have conversations, get to know that person,

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.530
 get to know their boundaries. Eso that way, you're you're you're able

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.910
 Thio. Understand what that person, uh, or how that person feels when

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.290
 you are with them on a everyday basis. Being in this organization

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.680
 and part of the military, you're with people for long periods of times.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.060
 You're with certain people for 2 to 3 years at a time, and you

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.440
 have to get to know that person and know their boundaries, what they

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.830
 like and what they don't like. And it all starts with sitting down

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.210
 and having a conversation again. Like I said in the beginning, I am

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.590
 a very, uh, affectionate person, and I am a touchy feely person. One

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.970
 of the trainings we do learn. Um here in this organization is how to

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.360
 treat people and how to, uh, interact with people. Um, for example,

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.740
 when I'm speaking to someone, obviously professionally, and if I want

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.120
 to touch them to get my point across, one of the things that I am

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.510
 authorized to do and that I'm trained to do is to touch them very

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.890
 softly or lightly on their shoulder or touch their elbow. That way they

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.270
 are not. They don't feel threatened or they don't feel that it is

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.650
 sexual in nature. Also, one of the ways that we deal with people,

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.040
 and the one of the ways that we are trained to deal with others is to

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.420
 make sure that we are not in a person's personal space. And nine times

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.800
 out of 10, you can always tell when a person is uncomfortable with

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.180
 how close you are. To them, eso, one of the other areas is to make

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.570
 sure that you're aware of how you are speaking to people and dealing

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.950
 with people in their personal space
