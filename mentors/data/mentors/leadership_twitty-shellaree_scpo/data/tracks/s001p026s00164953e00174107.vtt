00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.580
when I am tired at work or I'm fatigued. One of the things that I do is

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.300
 I walk away from the computer. Okay, Um, the building that I'm in

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.030
 is large, so I could go for a walk. Um, it would be nice if I could

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.760
 close my door and take a nap, But majority of the time, that's not gonna

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.480
 work. So what I do is I get up. I grabbed me a bottle of water,

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.210
 and I walk. I want maybe walk around by myself, or I walk the deck

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.940
 plates on what that means is I go to each one of my departments, and

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.660
 I started talking to my sailors, um, having conversations, drinking

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.390
 my water. Um, and that will help me with my fatigue at work.
