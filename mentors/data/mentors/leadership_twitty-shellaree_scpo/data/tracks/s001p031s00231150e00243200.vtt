00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.040
thanks. Yeah. When dealing with grief, there are ah lot of ways to deal.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.230
 Um, one of my first ways to deal with grief is to talk to someone,

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.430
 uh, in this organization, there are no really wrong ways to deal with,

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.620
 uh, grief. One of the things that they encourage, um, is counseling.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:31.810
 Um, I recently just lost my father. And, um, the command right

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:38.000
 away reached out and asked me if I needed anything. And one of the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.200
 recommendations was a counseling. And we reached out to military one

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.390
 source, and I am actually in counseling right now. Grief counseling.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.580
 Who would have thought that there's such a thing? They're counseling

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.770
 for everything. And now they have a grief counselor. And once I'm

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:08.970
 done with that, if I still need more counseling, one of the other resource

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.160
 is that we can utilize for counseling is Chaplain services and

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:21.350
 fleeting family services.
