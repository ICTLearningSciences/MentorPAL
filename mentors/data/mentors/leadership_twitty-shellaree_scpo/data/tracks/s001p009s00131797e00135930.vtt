00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.980
when, um, you feel like someone is being harassed? The first thing you

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.120
 should do is probably is talk to that person. Um, ask the questions.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.250
 Um, have a meeting with that person. A one on one with that person.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.380
 Um, depending on how they feel about having the conversation, if they're

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.510
 not comfortable with speaking to you, then you could make phone

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.650
 calls, give them information to ah, hotline or help line, um, to

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.780
 help them, um, get through it or talk about it. But when you start seeing

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.910
 the first signs of, maybe the person is shutting down and they're

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.050
 starting to seclude themselves. That's when you get involved, right

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.180
 in the beginning.
