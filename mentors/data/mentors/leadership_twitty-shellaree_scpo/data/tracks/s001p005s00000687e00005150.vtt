00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.810
if I had to. Team members that didn't have trust, you know, for each other.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.770
 In the beginning, um, I would have them sit and have a conversation,

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.730
 maybe with somebody in the room with them. Um, ask each other

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.690
 different questions. Maybe that has nothing to do with the team. Um,

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.640
 maybe personal questions. What's your favorite color? What's your

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.600
 favorite number? Um, why did you join the Navy? Um, sometimes when you

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.560
 have a trust or distrust with each other, it's because you don't

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.520
 know each other. You don't know each other story, and and it's it's

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.480
 important to connect that way, and that will help build trust.
