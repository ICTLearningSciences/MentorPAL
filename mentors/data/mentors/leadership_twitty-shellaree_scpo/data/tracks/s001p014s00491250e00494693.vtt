00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.590
having a conflict in the beginning of your leadership position, I would

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:12.330
 say it's not normal. However, it is probably understandable because

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.060
 you're new. Um, you're the new person that is part of the team. There

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.800
 are different personalities, different attitudes, different cultures

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.540
 and things like that. So, um, that would probably be the reason,

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:35.280
 um, if there were a conflict as a new leader.
