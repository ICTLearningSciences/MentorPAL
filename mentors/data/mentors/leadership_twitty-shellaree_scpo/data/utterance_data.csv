My job here is to help sailors, something I've always loved to do. I have six Children, five boys and one girl and a granddaughter. I came in the Navy in Akron, Ohio, As a reservist. I did two years of reserve time after I did my reserve time. It was your 9 11. I went to boot camp in October. In boot camp. I did everything I was supposed to do. Graduated and from there on, I came back home and they re called me the active duty because of 9 11. What that mean was I was at the reserve center taking care of sailors ordering different supplies for them. I realized I want to do something different. So I went after duty, full time support. After coming on as an active duty sailor, I went to a ship in Ingleside, Texas. I was on the ship for three years. As a culinary specialist, I realized I wanted to change my rate to something different as well. So that's one of my commanding officer told me. He said, If you pass on your inspections outside, off on you, to change your rate took hospital Cormack. And that's exactly what I did from hospital. From from leaving the ship, I went directly to hospital course school. That's where I was the second class and hospital course school. I left there and went to our D. C. I went to Great Lakes, one of my favorite jobs being in our d. C. I went there like I said in the beginning, as a second class from there, I made first very quickly, and I left Great Lakes as a chief, which is one of the greatest milestones in my life. I am now here at Naval Operational Support Center here in San Jose, California and I am the senior enlisted leader.
