,,leadership_twitty-shellaree_scpo,What kinds of behaviors do you ban that are sometimes allowed in the Navy?,"the behaviors that, um I think are allowed in every organization is the use of foul language.

,,leadership_twitty-shellaree_scpo,"How do I deal with differences in views of appropriate boundaries? (e.g., generational, cultural)","in any organization or just, uh, and in a personal, uh, life boundaries have to be set. Um, I actually read a book about boundaries and set in your boundaries. Boundaries are important. Um, I know for me, I am a very, um, affectionate person. I am a very touchy person, and I realized everyone is not like that. And so you have to be able to sit down with someone, have conversations, get to know that person, get to know their boundaries. Eso that way, you're you're you're able Thio. Understand what that person, uh, or how that person feels when you are with them on a everyday basis. Being in this organization and part of the military, you're with people for long periods of times. You're with certain people for 2 to 3 years at a time, and you have to get to know that person and know their boundaries, what they like and what they don't like. And it all starts with sitting down and having a conversation again. Like I said in the beginning, I am a very, uh, affectionate person, and I am a touchy feely person. One of the trainings we do learn. Um here in this organization is how to treat people and how to, uh, interact with people. Um, for example, when I'm speaking to someone, obviously professionally, and if I want to touch them to get my point across, one of the things that I am authorized to do and that I'm trained to do is to touch them very softly or lightly on their shoulder or touch their elbow. That way they are not. They don't feel threatened or they don't feel that it is sexual in nature. Also, one of the ways that we deal with people, and the one of the ways that we are trained to deal with others is to make sure that we are not in a person's personal space. And nine times out of 10, you can always tell when a person is uncomfortable with how close you are. To them, eso, one of the other areas is to make sure that you're aware of how you are speaking to people and dealing with people in their personal space"

I found out that he was struggling in the course when the commanding officer received a letter stating that he failed the course and would have to pay the money back. So my commanding officer came and brought the letter to me and I had to call the sailor in. It's not a good look. It's not good when you're SCM senior listed leader did not know that you were struggling when we were having all these conversations about your career and moving forward. So I had to contact the sailor having come in, have the conversation about what was going on. And then he explained to me that he tried to withdraw, but he waited too late to withdraw. He didn't think it was going to be an issue. But it is an issue because the letter went straight to the CEO, bypassed myself, bypassed the CEO at the XO and went straight to the commanding officer. He felt bad about it, and he and I asked him the question. Waas. Well, why did you tell me you were struggling? He said he thought he could handle it on his own, and that's fine. Handle those things on your own. It's fine. However, he should have explained it to me so I could have warned the CEO that he was going to be receiving this letter. Um, it's unfortunate we did take care of it. It's been a few weeks now, and it's all been taken care of. But that's a lesson learned for all sailors.

So we're not able to, for example, were not able to leave and go home right away, but we can take a break. So, um, I have a time where the sailors or the team, they have the little, um, paintball guns, and we take maybe an hour and we set up bottles and we allow the sailors or the team to just shoot the bottles. Who can shoot the most bottles down? Um, it breaks up the time a little bit. It breaks up the monotony on bare, all having fun, having a little bit of friendly competition. Competition.

,,leadership_twitty-shellaree_scpo,What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?,"one of the challenges that I faced, Uh, coming up through the ranks is, um, my For me, the challenge would be, uh, being maybe ah, junior and and my age is one of the challenges for me as, um, coming up the ranks. I was a junior sailor, but my age was a little older. Um, and for me, that was a challenge, because I I saw myself as a leader. And but my rank, uh, had a lot to do with it because I was a junior sailor and I it was challenging to move forward with certain things the way I thought the way I spoke the way I carried myself. And unfortunately, in the in this organization, we do a lot of things by rank and being a junior sailor, um, motivated to do great things and to be that leader. I had to stay in my place because of being a junior sailor and how I overcame that was just by waiting out my time, making sure that I was studying and reading and so that I could get to that next level, um, actually tow where I'm at now so that I could, uh uh, be the leader that I know I could be and then understand that, um, the junior sailor, especially now coming in, Uh, a little smarter, knowing a little bit, mawr, um, knowing that they are the foundation, or they set the tone for what we know now. Um, and I'm okay with that. I didn't understand it before when I was that junior sailor, um, coming into the ranks. But now, being a leader, I do understand that even though your rank is a junior moving up the ranks, you should be able to listen and encompass everything that the junior sailor has to offer."
,,leadership_twitty-shellaree_scpo,What is the most challenging part about your job?,"the most challenging part about my job is being an advisor. Um, I love my position, but at some points in my position, I realized that I have to have uncomfortable conversations with my sailors. I have to have uncomfortable conversations with the triad. And at the end of the day, my CEO, um, he makes the final decision. For example, I had a sailor who, uh, may have potentially, um, been around someone who has cove it at this time. Right now, we are in this cove it situation with with this disease and being in the military, we have to be really careful with that s So I did have a sailor who was around someone who tested positive for Cove It on and he came toe work and let us know that hey was in that area while he was there. He was also told that everyone had been tested and it came back negative. I did advise the triad that, um it's important for us to let everyone else know. I was also told that we he didn't want to alarm anyone and because the test came back negative. But the bigger picture is that everyone should know who is in the area with someone who has, uh, tested positive for Covic. Attend of the day. I did advise my commanding officer about, uh, that situation. He did change his mind, um, and did allow me to put it out to the rest of the sailors. But I realized the challenging part for me is no matter what at the at the end of every conversation, at the end of every situation that I advise him on, he is the deciding factor. And I have to carry out the mission. Um, and e have to carry out the mission sometimes with no questions asked. Um, and that could be a challenge for me."
,,leadership_twitty-shellaree_scpo,What is the biggest failure you ever had and what did you learn from it?,"the biggest failure that I have had, and I don't even know if it is really a failure. I really believe it's a lesson eso going up for Senior Chief, I think I've done that. I've put in a package, uh, for Senior Chief maybe five times. And each time I started to question myself like some of us do. And, um, you almost feel like you're failing, because in your mind, you're you're doing everything that you need to do as you know, to stay competitive in this organization, um, and to just take care of your sailors and your peers. And I think for me, the biggest failure was, uh, the fact that I questioned myself on guy, You get to a point where you don't feel like you're worthy of of of promotion. Andi, I think for me, that was the failure on my part. I could tell the story and maybe encourage others. But then the self reflection I have for myself and feeling that way, um, second guessing myself. And that was a failure to me. What I learned from that is, even though I question myself and I was, uh, I did my self reflection. I also learned that there's growth in that, Um, and it makes me a better person both personally and professionally. So although it didn't seem like a failure, the story doesn't seem like a failure because maybe it's personal, But for me, it made me feel some type of way and cause me to feel like it was It's part of being a failure, but I grew from it."
,,leadership_twitty-shellaree_scpo,What are the failures for which you are the most unhappy?,"the failures that I am most unhappy about, um, majority of the time. For me, it's my, uh it's personal. Um, and professional, I have a, for example, coming up in the ranks, and this organization, you know, came in the Navy kind of late in age and motivated as a sailor. But I had a couple of people who thought my my job performance and everything was amazing. But my administrative skills were not up to par. And I guess hearing that, um, from somebody of, ah, higher ranking than you, um, it makes you feel like you're a failure. Um, administratively. So you you have those those questions, those conversations about your failures and what your weaknesses and things are. And one of those is administrative for me, And it made me second guess it made me question myself. Um, but at the end of the day, I've learned from it, Um, and but that's Ah, that's a failure for me to a point where I, um when I start something, for example, working on, uh, packages for, uh, map meritorious advancement program. When I'm working on a package, I start to ask myself, um, am I doing this right administratively are the words correct? Does this sentence make sense? Does this paragraph makes sense? I second guess myself and to me, um, self sabotage is kind of like a failure."
,,leadership_twitty-shellaree_scpo,How accepting of failure is this work environment when a good and honest effort was made?,"here at my command when a person fails when a sailor fails, Um, it's very unfortunate. However, uh is growth. We deal with it by allowing the sailor to fail, um, and then asking the questions, You know what happened? How can we help? Um, and this brings out a conversation where they're able to speak about their failure and then learn from their failure. Um, I believe in second chances. If you're not failing, if you're not, uh, making mistakes, um, then you're not growing. Um, I don't believe that it's a weakness if you fail. Um, it's part of maybe some challenges, but myself, As a senior listed leader, I, um I accept it and allow that person to grow from it."
,,leadership_twitty-shellaree_scpo,What are sources of support when you took a chance and the result was poor?,"here at my command when things don't go well or well, the way we planned them. Um, some of the things that we can utilize is, uh, conversations, team meetings, um, sitting down and planning and working on how how we can fix it or how we can make it better. Um, it is so important. Thio have that conversation. Um, in this organization, nothing is. Nothing is perfect. So we have toe work at, uh, doing things better? Um, s o I just believe that having conversations on day, finding out what we could do, better having a plan that would help us, um, make things better."
,,leadership_twitty-shellaree_scpo,"How does someone recover from a professional ""bump in the road""?","in this organization, it's inevitable. There are going to be some bumps in the road both professionally and personally. Early in my career, I had a bump in the road and, uh, I had to go to a d r B, a disciplinary review board. That's where you stand in front of the chiefs of your command and they ask you questions, fact finding questions. Um, what I learned from that is that we're all going to make mistakes and that there are people here that care about you, and because of that, you can get through it. Um, there are There are chiefs who wanna help you. There are petty officers who want to help you, and there are commanding officers and executive officers who want to help you. So while there are bumps in the roads and things that happen, there is gonna always be somebody there. Thio talk you through it, uh, give you different tools to help you work through it. I like I was saying early in my career I had to go to a D r B because I was late for work. Um, I was on the ship at that time, and you could never, ever miss ships movement. Um, and I didn't go to mass, but I did go to DRB, and it was devastating. And at that time, sometimes when you have a bump in the road, people see you differently. But coming to work, uh, doing better? Um, you know, asking questions, getting help, maybe talking to someone, your chaplain or counseling things like that that could help you also get through those things. And that was one of the things I had to do. I was late for work and for personal reasons. And my lpo. She helped me by offering counseling and chaplains services so you can get through the bumps in the road. You just have to make sure that you're you're willing thio, ask for help and, uh, receive the help as well."
,,leadership_twitty-shellaree_scpo,What was a pivotal moment in your career/life?,"a pivotal moment in my career was when I was going through a divorce at a A junior as a junior sailor. It was pivotal because I also had my Children and I was on the ship, and I actually had to send my Children home to my parents while I was going through the divorce. Um, it was devastating. Um, there were court dates. There were days I had thio miss work. Um, okay. And it was mentally draining. I did get through it because I had my, uh, my leadership who believed in me and and knew that I was a great sailor. But it was It was personally, very hard and taxing on me mentally. Um, I had to go to counseling because of it, and my Children had to go to counseling before they left. So while I still had to do my job and, um, take care of my family, it was very trying and and and and hard for me. But at the end of the day, I did get through it. Um, just remembering who was there for me? My my lpo. My executive officer, uh, people who I I confided in about my situation, my divorce, um, and people who gave me the resource is to get through it. That counseling, Uh, the counselors and the chaplain who was very important in helping me get through have the conversations, Andre. Counseling with my Children. Um, but I got through it."
,,leadership_twitty-shellaree_scpo,What's the biggest risk you've taken in your career?,"one of the biggest risks I take in my career is being an adviser to my chain of command. My triad. Um, all conversations have to be had, Um, there are some tough conversations that have to be had advising your CEO. Um, when things come up, whether they're good, bad or ugly. Um, I am the adviser. Um, the risk I take with sharing things with my commanding officer, um, explaining to him that this might not be in the best interests of the command And then at the end of the day, knowing that he is the one that makes the final decision. And he's and he's also the one that writes my evil my evaluation at the end of the day, um, I have to be honest and true. With what? What? My beliefs, our And just know that what I said, um, what I say how I handle things with my commanding officer, that they're going to be taken professionally and respectfully and hope that he understands that the best interests of the command and himself, um, and the sailors are are taken, um, in a professional manner. And then, like I said again, um, always remembering that at the end of the day he is the one that makes the final decision, and that's to me can be, ah risk."
,,leadership_twitty-shellaree_scpo,What is the most dangerous thing you've ever done on the job?,"Yeah. One of the most dangerous things that I've done on this job is, for example, one of my sailors at a situation with their spouse. And she called me, and the first thing I did was get in my car and show up at her house. Um, because I wanted to help. I wanted to protect her. Um, I believe that was a dangerous thing to do, because, um, here we are with no protection. A Sfar, As you know, maybe calling the police or or something like that. We were both just wide open there, Um, at the home. Um, at that point, when I arrived to the home, she didn't let me in. Maybe for those reasons, but I did show up at the house, and I think, at that point, being a protector, uh, being the S e l. I believe that was a dangerous situation."
,,leadership_twitty-shellaree_scpo,What causes the most stress in your job?,"as the s e l. There are a lot of things that causes, uh, me a lot of stress. Um, the way I deal with my sailors, the way I deal with my triad. My commanding officer, Um, I worry a lot. I worry a lot about how the people around me are affected by their situations, Uh, their lives both professionally and and personally. Um, and that for me, causes a lot of stress. Um, for example, when I have conversations with my commanding officer, uh, about how we want to do certain things as faras running the command and how we deal with our sailors, Um, if he doesn't understand, uh, that each sailor has to be, um, dealt with, um, on a case by case basis. And I have to advise him of that that all sailors are not the same, that they're different. Um, that concerns me. And and and it worries me, and it does cause me some stress. Um, when I'm dealing with my sailors and they don't understand that I have to deal with them, um, actually, on a by case basis and everything in their situation, um, is different from maybe their peer or their junior sailor and I have to deal with them on different levels. Um, that's stressful. Um, and it is because I do worry. I want the best out of everyone. And it does cause me thio to feel a little stressful E."
,,leadership_twitty-shellaree_scpo,How do you deal with stress on the job?,"some of the ways that I deal with stress on the job. Um one, um I like to have conversations. So when I'm stressed, uh, maybe with a sailor or with my triad, I have a conversation. First, I have to have the conversation, ask the questions. Why, um, why are we doing things this way? Um, how can we do things better? And then I go to my office and I sit by myself and I reflect. And once I reflect and I journal, take my notes. Then I I de stress myself personally by going to the gym, Uh, maybe speaking to someone outside of my command. Ah, counselor. Ah, close friend. Someone who doesn't have any, uh, connection with what I'm doing. And that helps me de stress from majority of the situations that I go through here at work"
,,leadership_twitty-shellaree_scpo,What is a trick that you use to keep stress from boiling over?,"of course. So a little trick I used to keep stress from boiling over is to first say, Can we revisit that? And then I will immediately walk away and go to my safe place. And normally, my safe place is my office, and I will close the door, and I I will meditate, maybe call someone. Um But I have quiet and I will have quiet time if I'm not meditating or speaking to someone. One of my favorite tricks that I used to distress is to be quiet. Um, it's important.

,,leadership_twitty-shellaree_scpo,How do you handle self doubt?,"Yeah, when I am doubting myself or I am, uh, self doubting. One of the amazing, amazing things that I've learned is to journal.

Um, for example, if I say to myself, I can't do that, um, I'm not gonna do well at that. Then all of I write it down. Why did I say that? I asked myself all the time questions like Why? Why am I in this space where I'm asking myself and self doubting myself? So I I write it down. Why did I say I can't do that? Why did I say I'm not going to do well at it? And I read it.

Okay, Um, the building that I'm in is large, so I could go for a walk. Um, it would be nice if I could close my door and take a nap, But majority of the time, that's not gonna work. So what I do is I get up. I grabbed me a bottle of water, and I walk.

And it could be very boring on monotonous. Some of the things that we do, uh, here at the mosque or the reserve center when we are in a boring situation or a monotonous situation, Um, I will get on the loudspeaker and I'll say, Hey, everybody is time for a huddle and we meet on the quarter deck at the Reserve Center and we talk about what? What are some of the boring things that we're doing right now? What are some of the monotonous things that we're doing? And we have a conversation, and then we plan to get the work done at a in a timely manner, and that will help take some of the boring and the monotony out of it. Um, it sounds funny or may even sound weird, but it works. We don't do it often, but some days when we're at that point where we're over the top with this monotonous work, we meet in a huddle and have a conversation, and then after we're done talking about it, we go back to our spaces and the work is done, uh, in an efficient manner, and they're more motivated to get it done because we had, like, this little football huddle."

Like I said, it's legalized, but we are. We fall under the ucmj a, which is zero tolerance for drugs, and we also fall under federal guidelines.

,,leadership_twitty-shellaree_scpo,"If you could change one thing about your job, what would it be?","If I could change one thing about my job, it would probably be training. For example, as the SCL, we first come into this job sitting in the seat, not knowing anything, especially for me, Someone who has never been the S e l of a reserve center. If I could change one thing about that, it would be the training. The training should start after, uh, sitting in the seat. I believe that I should learn the job for us or we should learn the job first and then send us to the training. That way we would understand what the position is about. Um, I've been at this SCL job for about two years now, and when I first came on board, I went straight to training. I didn't understand what I was learning, but now that I'm here, I feel that this would be a better time for me to go to the training.

One of the things that I've learned is that in order for you to be successful, you have to be organized. And the way I've learned to do that is to write down everything. Um, five years ago, I learned about journaling, and I started to journal and the journal Lean carried over into all aspects of my life, and it actually helped me to organize my thoughts and, um, toe organize how I want to present things. Um, when I'm dealing with my commanding officer, when I'm dealing with my sailors or even when I'm dealing with my family.
