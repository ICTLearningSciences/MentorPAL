There might be a situation that you decide that you can't really afford

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.150
 college at the time or it's not an option for you for some reason.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.800
 That was my case. When I was a few months after high school, I tried

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.450
 the college thing, I went for a semester I got an F in the class because

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.100
 I was working two eight hour jobs and I didn't have a car. So

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.750
 I just decided to drop out, and for another year I was bouncing around

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.400
 different jobs it was really hard. It felt like I was lily padding

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.050
 from workplace too workplace. I tried to join the military before

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.700
 and I wasn't accepted because my eyesight was bad. So I tried again

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.350
 and fortunately I was accepted. The difference was for me, once I joined

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.000
 the military I realized that they gave me a place to sleep they

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.650
 gave me free food all of my conveniences were taken care of. The only

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.300
 thing that I had to do was study, then after my study period was

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.950
 over then work. So the military might be an option for some of you.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.600
 Also if you have a friend that can give you a decent paying job, you

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.250
 might wanna do that for a year or two while you save up some money

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.900
 so that when you do go to college you can really focus on it the way

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.550
 that you should instead of just trying to go by it slightly. So consider

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.200
 another job if college isn't the right thing for you right now.
