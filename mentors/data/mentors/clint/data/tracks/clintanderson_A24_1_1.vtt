During your off time, while you're deployed, you have a couple things

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.420
 that you can do. So, I remember, personally I would always go play poker

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.210
 and steal people's money even though you're not supposed to but

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.990
 we'd find some ways to, you know, have fun with each other. We would

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.780
 trade, like coke bottles or trade cigarettes. Some people smoked,

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.560
 I didn't, but I'd still, you know, like be in the middle of trading

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.350
 things for cards. I also watched a lot of DVDs. So, we had an MWR, a

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.140
 morale recreation and welfare program where you have a choice of maybe

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.920
 200 or 300 DVDs. You just tell them that's the one that you want

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.710
 and then you can watch it on, if you have your own personal DVD player

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.490
 or a laptop. I'd also just go out there on the fantail and just

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.280
 watch the ships go by, you know, ships go by and jets go by and maybe

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.060
 for going along the coast, just look at the beautiful country that

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.850
 we're going beside.
