00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.430
Getting accepted to a good college shouldn't be the end all and be all.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.010
 From what I understand if you are one of the smartest guys in your

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.590
 class then it doesn't really matter where you go unless you go to the

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.170
 top, super top places like Google or Facebook or Twitter something

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.740
 like that. But for ninety five percent of the places if you're one

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.320
 of the top students in your class then you can go to the local state

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.900
 school and you can be just fine. That said if you wanted, if your

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.480
 heart is set on going to a very prestigious school, then yes grades

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.060
 matter and yes SAT scores matter, but I think the thing that pushes

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.640
 everybody over the top is what you do outside, what you do outside of

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.220
 those walls that define your high school. So if you're a computer

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.800
 science major then make a program and sell a game. If you're a mechanical

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.380
 engineer then make a drone and fly it to local parks. If you're

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.960
 an aeronautics engineer get your pilot's license, you know, do something

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.530
 that shows that you can do something that's more than just books

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.110
 and studying and listen to a professor and doing your homework on

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.690
 time. Do something that shows that you have a passion for what you're

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.270
 trying to study and then those professors at the university will

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.850
 see that and they'll listen to you.
