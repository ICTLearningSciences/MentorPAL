00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.760
Depending on the type of job that you go into, a STEM degree can take

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.680
 you anywhere you want to go. So if you talk about salary, engineering

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.590
 is one of the highest paid professions in the career industry. You

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.500
 can be a chemical engineer, petroleum engineer, and those are some

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.420
 of the highest paid professions that you can have and you don't even

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.330
 need a college degree for them. If you're talking about traveling,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.240
 then just like any job depends on which job you wanna go into, but chances

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.150
 are you're probably gonna be in one building doing your engineering

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.070
 thing just like everybody else. There's a humanities guy over

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.980
 there, there's an english literature guy over there and you're doing

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.890
 your engineering field. However, the difference is, the place that

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.810
 you're at, you could be working with your hands a lot. So whereas if

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.720
 you're in a humanities place you're either typing on the computer

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.630
 most the time or you're writing something most of the time, with a mechanical

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.550
 engineering degree you could be working on a robot, you could

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.460
 be walking around it, opening it up screwing some screws and using

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.370
 the controller to make it move around. If you're an electrical engineer

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.280
 can be in this room but you're opening up the panel, you're checking

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.200
 the voltage, you're looking at your oscilloscope to get the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.110
 right readings, you're changing a circuit board. So I think if your

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.020
 question is where will an engineering degree take me as far as what

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.940
 I do, then engineering opens up a lot of hands on and mental work as

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.850
 opposed to a humanities careers.
