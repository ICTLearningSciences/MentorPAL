00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.960
Computer science is broken up into basically two different forms. The

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.070
 first one is computer science itself, which is everything that's associated

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.180
 with the laptop that's in front of you. That includes the theory

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.290
 that's behind it, the abstractions that are associated with thinking

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.410
 about the way that you know, computers should work. That involves

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.520
 the electronics that are behind it, you open up the computer and

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.630
 you can see the mother board, you can see the resistors, you can see

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.740
 the current that's traveling through it. So that's the hardware portion,

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.850
 that's the thing that's on the screen that deals with web design

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.960
 that deals with the way that the colors look, also graphics. That's

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.070
 how the light comes from the computer and hits your eyes. There's

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.180
 the user experience part which is when you have buttons all over the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.290
 screen, and maybe this button shouldn't be like here, maybe people

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.410
 want it bigger or smaller, maybe they want it on the other side screen.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.520
 Maybe they think that it's boring, but if you change it in a certain

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.630
 way so that it's more fun. So that's, all of that combined is

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.740
 computer science. But what most people think about when they think

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.850
 of computer science is actually the coding part. Coding is what happens

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.960
 when you have your laptop open, you open up a program and you start

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.070
 pushing buttons on your computer screen to write lines of code so

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.180
 that when you compile it, you press play, it does something for you.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.290
 So for instance you can make a game, you compile the game and all

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.410
 of a sudden you can play the game. Or you can make, you can start coding

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.520
 and then when you press play, you have Microsoft Word based on

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.630
 the code that you wrote. So that's what most people think about when

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.740
 they think of computer science, they think of the program that's associated

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.850
 with it, but computer science is a very broad range.
