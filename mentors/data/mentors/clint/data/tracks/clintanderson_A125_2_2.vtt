00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.160
When I was a kid, I went to the library one day and I got this book, and

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.470
 it showed me all of the salaries that people make. I was a musician

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.790
 at that time, I never played any music or instrument, but like I

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:22.100
 knew that you know, like I was really involved in music and I wanted

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.410
 to. So then I saw how much musicians make and it's very very low, and

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.730
 okay well I'm artist at least you know like maybe about drawing,

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.040
 I get my art history from my mom and I looked at their salaries and

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.350
 it was very low. So then I set shut that book and then I kind of gave

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.660
 up on looking at salaries for awhile. A question that I would have,

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.970
 a question that I wish I would asked someone, is what are the different

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.290
 salaries that people can make and how can I become more involved

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.600
 in getting those high paying, those high paying jobs. And not only

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.910
 that, let's say I wanted to be an artist or a musician, how do I enter

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.230
 that field without being discouraged by their salaries. So how

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.540
 can I follow my passion without being disheartened by financial figures.
