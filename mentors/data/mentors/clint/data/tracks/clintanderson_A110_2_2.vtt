The advice that I have for someone being bullied, it depends on how you

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.180
 want to look at it. My advice that I did for myself was that I just

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.850
 stayed in my own little world. Yeah I wasn't very sociable as a kid,

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.520
 but something else that I did that actually changed it, I don't suggest

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.180
 this but this is what happened for me, and it stopped me from

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.850
 being bullied, was that I changed myself. I realized that after I put

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.520
 in contacts and took off my glasses, and I start working out you

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.180
 know, I was working out, I was on the track and field club so I ran

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.850
 all the time and I could notice my muscles getting bigger, my chest

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.520
 you know I could shake them. I had a six pack you know, I realized that

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.180
 after I did that, all of the bullying stopped. I don't suggest that

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.850
 because you should be whoever you want to be. I mean because I didn't

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.520
 change myself like that to stop the bullying, I changed myself

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.180
 because that's the person that I wanted to be, you know. I liked not

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.850
 having glasses you know hurt my nose, I liked working out because

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.520
 you know it made me more energetic, but whether you stay yourself or

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.180
 whether you have a different personality or you know you change your

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.850
 look or your feel, all that doesn't matter. The only thing that I

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.520
 can suggest if you are getting bullied is to realize that you're somebody,

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.180
 that you're gonna be somebody great later on in life if you,

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.850
 if you apply yourself and to not let those words sink in.
