My biggest weakness would probably have to be my programming skills. When

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 I was compared to the other people that I was working with, the

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.850
 other students at UC Berkeley and at USC, it seemed like they were pretty

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 bright and I had to step up my game and to tell you the truth,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.850
 even as a kid I was never really technically oriented. So, I think

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.850
 I had to work a little bit harder than other people to kind of get to

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 a decent level. So, I took lots of late night study sessions, took

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 lots of reading books, some Lynda.com courses, maybe some YouTube courses,

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.850
 Bucky's World, where he, kind of, explains these different programming

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.850
 assignments in easy to understand language rather than my

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.850
 professor because, like, I went to the lecturer and I didn't understand

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 what he said so I better, like, learn on my own from this guy and

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.850
 then I can understand what professor said, you know, little bit better

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.850
 than usual. So, lots of things like that had to happen for me

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.850
 to step up my game, to compete with others in my peer group.
