00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.290
Once you join the military you're going to really find that your service

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.730
 is broken up into two chunks. It's when you're back at home and when

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.160
 you're out on deployment. When you're back at home,then you're going

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.600
 to find that your job is basically 9 to 5. You're going to wake

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.040
 up just like everybody else in the world, do your job, have lunch,

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.470
 and then go home at 5 o'clock and then you're just free to do whatever

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.910
 you want. So the way you normally meet people, meeting them at the

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.350
 malls, at the library, at clubs, at bars. Those are the same ways

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.790
 that you're gonna find. When you're on deployment however, things are

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.230
 a lot different. When you're just on that boat, it feels very claustrophobic

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.660
 sometimes. Especially, at least for me, I realized that most

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.100
 of the people that I was around are many guys. I think the ratio

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.540
 is like seventy percent male to 30 percent on the aircraft carrier.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.970
 So you're going to be in a space, you're talking to them all at the

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.410
 same time, all the same people. However on those deployments, you do

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.850
 get to have port calls, which means that you go into another country

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.290
 like Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore, or Thailand and for four days

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.730
 or five days then that's your day to roam free. Most of the time,

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.160
 you get liberty. That means that you get to have those days off. During

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.600
 that time, your chance to meet people are increased substantially.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.040
 So for instance, when I was in Australia, they knew that we were

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.470
 coming in. They knew that the Navy was going to be there. So many people

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.910
 would come in from other places just to spend time in those hotels

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.350
 and experience our lives and our culture. When you go to a bar,

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.790
 people know that you're in the military, because you look different.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.230
 You have a clean shaven face and maybe there aren't that many black

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.660
 people there or there aren't that many Hispanics there. So you stand

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.100
 out. Then they're going to want to come up to you. That's something

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.540
 that doesn't happen in the United States. No one, you know--people

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.970
 don't just show up and buy you a beer. So it can be easier at times

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.410
 when you have those moments of freedom, when you're on deployment.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.850
 When you're back home, it's the same as anything else.
