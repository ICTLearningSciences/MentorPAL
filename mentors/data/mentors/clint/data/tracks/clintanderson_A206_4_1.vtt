00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.350
Computer science has a lot of problems that I wish would change and the

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.850
 biggest part is computer science education. That's, you know, the

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.350
 field that I'm choosing to go into. It's really hard to learn where

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.850
 to start with computer science. It's such a broad field and someone

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.350
 that's interested in STEM comes to me and says, "What should I do? Where

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.850
 should I start?" and I say, "Okay, well, pick up a programming

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.350
 book, learn C#, learn C++ or learn any programming language actually

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.850
 and even that, that should be enough to, like, start them on their

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.350
 journey but it's not. There's so many different avenues to try and many

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.850
 of them are, I have to admit, are badly worded. For instance, when

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.350
 I was starting to learn computer science programming, some of the

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.850
 books that I picked up were made by computer scientists. I don't think

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.350
 that those are the ones that should be writing the computer science

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.850
 books. I think the people that should be writing are the educators,

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.350
 are the ones who think visually, are the ones who think graphically,

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.850
 are the ones who think, "Well, you know, I'm showing C#, so I need

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.350
 to put some bombs and some explosions and some, you know, some nicely

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.850
 worded subtext. You know, like, I have to be able to write to

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.350
 a ten-year old and that the ten-year old should understand it. Rather

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.850
 than that, I think the ones who are really good at computer science,

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.350
 they're really smart, they're, you know, egg heads, you could say

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.850
 and then they decide to be educators and sometimes they don't match

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.350
 up. So, I wish that there were better educational books out there for

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.850
 computer science.
