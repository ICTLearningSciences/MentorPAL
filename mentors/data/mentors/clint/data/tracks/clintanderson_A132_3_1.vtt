00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.910
If I had to rejoin the Navy, and considering the different options that

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.960
 I could have, I think that being an electrician really opened up some

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.020
 doors for me. It actually like alllowed me to think about different

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.070
 things than I would have otherwise. I know about nuclear technology,

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.130
 I know about electricity things, voltage, current, resistors, and

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.180
 about power and watts. I know about lots of things that I had never

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.240
 even considered myself interested in before. So does that help me,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.290
 in a sense, I think it does. It gives me a better perspective. Would

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.350
 I do it over again? So the thing that I'm lacking from doing my nuclear

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.410
 technology path, is I don't have a long history with computer

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.460
 science. So I think if I would have joined like for instance the IT

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.520
 field, the information technology field, then after eight years I'd

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.570
 be really really bright about computer science and networks and what's

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.630
 going on in the, on the interior of a computer. However, the problem

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.680
 would be that I wouldn't know the electrical portion of it. So

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.740
 I think I'm happy with my decision, but I would probably try to do something

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.790
 more computer science oriented if I had to do it again, knowing

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.850
 that I would do it in the future.
