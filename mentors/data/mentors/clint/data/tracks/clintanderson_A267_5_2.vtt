00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.850
Exercise is a really big part of all of the services. Every six months

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 we have this training that requires you to, it's not training, it's

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.850
 a physical fitness exam where they look at how much you weigh, they

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 request that you do push ups, sit ups, and you run a mile and half.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.850
 I think that's pretty standard for all military services. However,

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.850
 they don't all provide you with the same amount of time to do it. For

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 instance, in the Navy, they don't give me any time to exercise, you

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 always have to do that outside of your working hours. I think for

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.850
 the marines they probably do, it's probably inherent in you know waking

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.850
 up in the morning and you all PT together. Probably the army is

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.850
 similar that way too, depending on what type of job you have. I think

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 the airforce is similar to the Navy where you pretty much work out

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.850
 on your own time, during lunch time or after or before work. In any

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.850
 case all of the services require you to be in shape.
