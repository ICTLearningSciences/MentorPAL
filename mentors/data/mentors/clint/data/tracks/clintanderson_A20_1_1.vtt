00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.350
I'm not an Officer. I'm a Chief, which is an E7 for the pay grade. The

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.850
 military is broken up into two portions, enlisted people who actually

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.350
 do the work and officers who basically manage. Now, the enlisted

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.850
 people, after a certain pay grade, E6 or E7, you start to supervise

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.350
 those enlisted people. Officers, from day one, they're automatically

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.850
 in charge of the whole unit.
