00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.360
If you're interested in going into computer science, the best person to

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.880
 talk to, obviously would be a computer scientist, if you know one.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.390
 They're probably not so easy to come by. I didn't know too many when

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.900
 I was growing up. There's probably a lot more now because it's a bigger

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.410
 field now but chances are, if you don't know a computer scientist,

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.930
 then obviously you go down the line, if you know an engineer. If

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.440
 you don't know an engineer, then even a mathematician. I don't know

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.950
 there's that many mathematicians I know either. So, anybody that can

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.470
 think logically about something, then they're probably a good person

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.980
 to go to and by that I mean, so if you're looking around a normal

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.490
 city, then anybody that is in the STEM field could probably give you

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.000
 some kind of idea about what they do and I don't think computer science

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.520
 would be that far behind. So, for instance, if you're a car mechanic.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.030
 You can ask a car mechanic, "Why do you like what you do?".

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.540
 They're going to say, "Well, I like cars. I have a few cars myself.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.060
 And because I liked it so much, I wanted to know what was inside of

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.570
 the car. So, I remember the first time I pulled open the hood and then

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.080
 I was looking around on the inside and I was asking questions about

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.590
 all those things and at first it was very very daunting but after

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.110
 I learned what the, that thing there did and that engine part there

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.620
 did and that alternator does. Once I started learning about those,

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.130
 you know, then the pieces start to fit and eventually, I knew, you

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.640
 know, half the engine, 75% and then all of the engine and then it's

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.160
 really interesting at that point." So, that little thing that I just

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.670
 told you, is probably what most STEM people would say about whatever

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.180
 it is that they're doing. As an Electrician, I would pry open up a

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.700
 load center and tell you the same exact thing. Well, those are the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.210
 bars, those are the bus breakers, there's the current, voltage, blah,

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.720
 blah, blah. As a computer scientist, I'd tell you the same thing.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.230
 This is, like, the program and this is, like, the initial settings,

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.750
 and you go down here and here are all these functions and this function

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.260
 does this and this function does that. As an Electricians, I'm sorry,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.770
 an Electronics Technician, I'd tell you the same thing about a

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.290
 circuit breaker. Well, this is the resistor and this is the motherboard

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.800
 and, you know, this goes over here to that part and here's the

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.310
 blueprint for it and so, I would say the same thing that the car mechanic

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.820
 would say about that circuit breaker. So, anybody would probably

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.340
 give you some kind of clue about what it is that they do if they're

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.850
 in the STEM technology field.
