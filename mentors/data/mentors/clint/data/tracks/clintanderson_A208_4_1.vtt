00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.530
For the United States military, I think many of the jobs that we do, do

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.200
 have some kind of STEM-ness associated with it. That's Science, Technology,

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.880
 Engineering and Math. So, he could be a cook. Chances are,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.550
 there would be some kind of training that you do, based on, like, the

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.230
 grill. The fact that you're supposed to push these buttons and turn

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.900
 these knobs and, you know, you have to do maintenance on it, so you

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.580
 have to open it up and clean it or something that. That could happen.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.260
 Additionally, when we do General Quarters, that's when, like the

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.930
 whole entire ship pretends that they're at war and, you know, they

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.610
 have to, like, do certain things to make sure that order is kept, that

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.280
 fires are put out, that, you know, like, if there's a hole in the

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.960
 wall that's patched up if it's flooding and you have to take it out.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.630
 So, all of these things, they need some kind of understanding about

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.310
 the technology that's behind it. So, for instance, you have a fire

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.990
 fighting bottle and this is any job in the military, it could be a

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.660
 Boatswain's Mate, it could be a Quarter Master, it could be an Electrician's

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.340
 Mate, we all have to understand that this bottle has to put

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.010
 out this fire. The fire, you have to understand, is it class Charlie

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.690
 fire, class Alpha fire? You have to understand that the bottle is

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.360
 metal and it has to be on the ground and when you blow it, when you

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.040
 squeeze the trigger, that it has to be on the ground so you don't get

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.710
 shocked because of the speed at which the coolant leaves the nozzle.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.390
 So, it's kind of technical in that way and you have to understand

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.070
 why. So, there are many things that are on the ship that can be considered

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.740
 STEM as well and you're going to be dealing with it no matter

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.420
 what you are. Some of us, like, we do it for our job no matter what.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.090
 So, Electrician's Mate, you know, my normal job is check voltage

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.770
 and current, there's Fire Controlman, they're the ones who, like, use,

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.440
 they have to understand about the weapons and weapons systems. There's

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.120
 Electronics Technician who has to remove and replace the resistors

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.800
 that are in the circuit boards. There's mechanics who deal with

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.470
 the big pumps all around the ship, the gears, the switches, the panels,

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.150
 the turbine generators, you know. They're the ones who actualy,

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.820
 like, open it up and you know, like, maybe operate the system or clean

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.500
 the system. There are many STEM fields and even if you're not specifically,

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.170
 like, a STEM rate, you're going to be dealing with STEM

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.850
 equipment.
