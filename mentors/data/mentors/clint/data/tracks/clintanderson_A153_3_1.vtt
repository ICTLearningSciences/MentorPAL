00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.460
Throughout your whole military career, you basically are going to be taken

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.070
 care of, regardless of whether you're an E1 or an admiral. They

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.680
 provide your housing in a different type of way, they provide your

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.290
 food in a different type of way. So this is what I mean. When you just

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.910
 join the military, they know you don't make that much cash, so what

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.520
 they do is, they, some people they have to make them stay on the

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.130
 ship, you know, to sleep. After you make it to around, like, E5, the

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.740
 second class petty officer level, then they start giving you this thing

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.350
 called B.A.H. It's basic allowance for housing. They say, "If you

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.960
 choose to, you're allowed to find an apartment out in the world and

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.570
 we'll give you money for it." In other locations if you're second

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.180
 class petty officer, then they might allow you to stay in the houses

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.790
 on base. Especially if you are in a foreign country, then, you know,

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.410
 you'll probably be staying on base. As you get a lot higher in rank,

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.020
 like, for instance if you're a chief or a senior chief, master chief

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.630
 or if you're an officer, then they probably give you lots of cash

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.240
 and they allow you to, like, find a much bigger house. Because chances

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.850
 are, those people probably have bigger families.
