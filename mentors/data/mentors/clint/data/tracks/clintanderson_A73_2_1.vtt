00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.800
So, I'd have to admit, the military does a very good job of marketing

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.740
 itself to be very, very tough, very strong and very team-oriented. You

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.690
 can drive down any street and if you see a picture for the military,

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.640
 you might see someone in these, in this uniform, but in a very very

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.590
 movie style picture. And it's not always like that. For the most

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.530
 part, we're not soldiers. I'm not a soldier, I'm a sailor which is

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.480
 different than what many people think of the military. When you think,

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.430
 when many people think of the military, they think of a full-metal

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.380
 jacket, you know, with your hard hat, your helmet and, you know, walking

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.320
 around with a gun and to tell you the truth, I've never, you

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.270
 know, picked up a machine gun. The best I got was, like a little laser

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.220
 pointer in bootcamp. Otherwise, I've never, I've never seen a gun.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.170
 So, the real military is a wide range of jobs. You have people working

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.110
 on the weapon system, you have people talking languages, you have

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.060
 people down in the nuclear plants, you have people that are cooks,

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.010
 you have people showing the jets how to move. But, what's really presented,

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.960
 what's romanticized is the basic soldier, you know, the Army

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.900
 style, the Marine style. So, the Navy's kind of different, in a good

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.850
 way.
