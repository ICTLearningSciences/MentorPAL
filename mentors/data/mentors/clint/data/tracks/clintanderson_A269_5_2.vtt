00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.630
My job in particular is very transferable to the civilian world because

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.410
 everybody needs power, and nuclear technology is one of the main ways,

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.180
 one of the cheapest ways, one of the cleanest ways to produce that

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.960
 power. So for my field, I think sixty percent of the people that

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.740
 are employed by the nuclear companies are ex-Navy. There are many jobs

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.520
 out there that can be transferable, anything that's engineering

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.290
 related is highly transferable. Even though you're on a ship or on a

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.070
 submarine or with military equipment. The concepts the chemistry, the

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.850
 math and science, they're all transferable. Other jobs aren't quite

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.630
 as transferable. So for instance if you're working with weapons,

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.410
 once you get out the civilian side, although there are some weapons

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.180
 companies, many of them are aren't really looking for, well you might

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.960
 not be looking to get back into the weapons section. However, depending

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.740
 on what you learned, the same concepts, the engineering concepts

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.520
 can be transferable. So it really depends on what type of job you

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.290
 want, what type of job you do, and the education that you receive while

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.070
 you're there. That's gonna dictate what you can do on the outside.
