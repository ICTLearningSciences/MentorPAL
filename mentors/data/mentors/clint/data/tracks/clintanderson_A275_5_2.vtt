00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.080
I've experienced so many great things in the military and I'm really proud

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.310
 of them. One of the best things I've experienced is this thing

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.540
 called MWR(Morale, Welfare, Recreation), it's morale, welfare, and recreation,

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.770
 and they provide you with pool tables and bowling and of

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.000
 all of these things that you can do around the community, hiking, skiing,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.230
 fishing, all at very cheap prices, and sometimes they even provided

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.470
 the gear for it. I also had a great time with the USO(United Service

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.700
 Organization). So I'm not an active duty military member anymore,

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.930
 however whenever I go to an airport, there is always the USO there

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.160
 that takes care of me. I can put my bags down, I can sit back and

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.390
 relax, watch some TV, have some free snacks, so the USO and the recreation

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.620
 center when you're active duty, they are some of the biggest

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.850
 military perks that I've experienced.
