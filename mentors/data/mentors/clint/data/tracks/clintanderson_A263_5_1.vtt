00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.610
I think that the military has one of the best educational systems in all

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.380
 of America. I've been to a public university, private university,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.140
 community college, and I think that the best education that I've ever

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.910
 received was from the military, and there's a reason for this. They

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.670
 want to make sure that the people that go through their educational

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.440
 system, whether it's for two weeks, whether it's for two years, you

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.200
 need to know your stuff very well. People's lives are gonna be at

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.970
 risk and you have to be able to handle multimillion dollar equipment

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.730
 without breaking it. After that, after your military career if you

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.500
 choose to do something else, people know this. So that's why sixty

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.260
 percent of the nuclear technologists outside are ex-Navy because they

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.030
 know that the Navy people know their jobs well. Regardless of what

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.790
 your job is, whether it's being a spy as a crytotechnologist, whether

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.560
 it's being the nuclear Navy, whether it's being the cook. At the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.320
 end, people will know that you've done your job well, you have the education

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.090
 for it, and you have lots of work experience with it. So your

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.850
 future education looks bright with a job in military.
