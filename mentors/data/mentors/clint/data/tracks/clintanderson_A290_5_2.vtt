00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.970
For those of you who didn't do quite as good as you would have liked to

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.090
 in high school, hopefully that doesn't come to bite you later on.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.200
 The military has this entrance exam that's going to test you on your

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.320
 basic skills. The basic skills are some things like math and science,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.440
 a little bit of logic, a little bit of language and if you can't

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.560
 pass that basic part, then unfortunately you can't join the military

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.670
 at that time. That doesn't prevent you from going back and trying to

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.790
 get some of those skills, trying to learn some of those things and

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.910
 trying again. You can try as many times as you want. However, once

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.030
 you join the military, then however you did in high school doesn't matter

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.140
 at all but it does really affect your promotion. So, if you're

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.260
 not really strong in school, then you're going to really hate the fact

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.380
 that, to be advanced, you're going to be tested. That advancement

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.500
 exam is going to really test all of the things that you learned in

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.610
 school and all of your on job training. So, hopefully you pick up some

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.730
 of those high school motivational habits when you're in the military.
