00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.600
I've been, I've been involved with lots of computer science projects one

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.350
 that I'm currently with is my start up making a virtual reality little

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.100
 a character and it's going to be shipped off to PlayStation and

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.850
 it's really cool to work with my friends, but the the project that

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.600
 I'm most proud of is probably the big major project that I did for

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.350
 my masters at University of Southern California it's called advance

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.100
 games design, that's the class I was in, and the project was called

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.850
 'Recall'. You have this virtual reality headset on and you walk around

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.600
 this crazy space trying to remember things as they appear while you're

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.350
 walking and the fact that you're in a virtual reality room kinda

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.100
 helps you kinda like relate what it is you saw with what you're trying

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.850
 to remember, it uses the method of loci.
