00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.050
A rate is basically the specialty that a military person has. So, my rate

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.250
 is EMC, Electrician's Mate but you could have Fire Control Men,

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.450
 you could have Boatswain's Mate. So, whatever you go to A school for,

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.650
 that's gonna be the term, your rate, for the rest of your military

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.850
 career.
