00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.410
The things that interested me the most and influenced me the most when

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.970
 I close my college, well there are many things. So I went to three

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.530
 different colleges. I went to Pasadena City College, that's in the Los

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.090
 Angeles area. I went to University of California, Berkeley it's up

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.640
 near San Francisco, and I went to USC, that's also near the Los Angeles

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.200
 area. One big thing was the landscape. All three of those places

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.760
 were absolutely beautiful, Berkeley is kind of up on a hill, USC

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.320
 has beautiful pristine buildings, and my community college, it looked

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.880
 like a university. It was right beside Caltech, California Institute

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.440
 of Technology and you can tell that they're right beside each other

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.000
 because I couldn't tell the difference that it was a community college

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.560
 so. The people around is another big thing that's very important.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.110
 So I like diversity. All three of my universities you walk around

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.670
 and you know all different shapes, sizes, and colors. Right now where

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.230
 I'm at in Japan it's not so much. So you can kind of really tell

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.790
 the difference and for me I just like seeing people similar to me,

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.350
 and different than me, and smarter than me, and people that I could

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.910
 trash in math you know. So I like that whole entire spectrum of people.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.470
 Also I think the biggest thing for me when I decided my university

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.030
 was the reputation. So I tried to go to the best that I could. In

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.590
 fact I wasn't accepted to Berkeley the first time that I applied, and

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.140
 I said you know what I came from Washington all the way back to California

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.700
 my hometown specifically to go to this university, so once

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.260
 I was rejected, I went back to my university, I studied even harder,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.820
 I got a 4.0 that semester, I took on another job, I did research,

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.380
 I did all the things, I took extra classes, I did all of the things

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.940
 to make me a really more mature, more intelligent person to finally

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.500
 get into that university, because I realize that worldwide, wherever

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.060
 I mentioned that university people would automatically know the process

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.610
 that I had to go through the schooling that I got, and it would

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.170
 give me you know the jobs that I needed, and maybe the math and the

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.730
 science and engineering and the programming that I required to do my

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.290
 future things. So reputation was probably the biggest thing for me

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.850
 when I chose the college that I did.
