If you're thinking about becoming a computer scientist yourself, I would

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.470
 have to say that the first thing you should do is probably look online

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.790
 to find out about what different types of jobs there are and what

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.100
 it is they do. With a little bit of experience, with a little bit

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.410
 of browsing around on Google, you can kinda get an idea about it.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.730
 But it they don't really tell you exactly what they do, so the next

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.040
 person would be probably someone in the field obviously. If you can

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.350
 find a NASA computer scientist then go for it you know, but any university

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.660
 student who's your junior, senior level, they have your basic

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.970
 programming skills they have your basic idea of what computer theory

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.290
 involves. So just asking a couple questions you know, whether it's

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.600
 been hard for them, whether anybody with a with a normal high school

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.910
 degree can kinda do this work, whether the job that they're doing

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.230
 is really really complex. It ranges so they might not be the guide you

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.540
 the best, but they can give you an idea of like kind of where you

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.850
 fit in, and whether it's a career that you want to try yourself.
