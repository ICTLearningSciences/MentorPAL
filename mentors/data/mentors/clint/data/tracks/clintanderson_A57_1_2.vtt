00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.050
When I started to go to school, I wanted to be able to speak five languages

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.250
 by the time I was 27. I was 21 at that time. So, that's why I

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.450
 wanted to join the military, to go to their world famous language schools

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.650
 and learn to speak French, which I knew a little bit of, German,

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.850
 which I knew a little bit of, Spanish which I knew a little bit of

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.050
 and my English. Since then, I've also learned Japanese. So, the reason

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.250
 that I'm in Japan right now, is so that I can actually learn the

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.450
 language fully, because I didn't know that many languages up until

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.650
 now. So, I decided, "Hey, come here, live for a long time and learn

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.850
 it, you know, intensively for a year."
