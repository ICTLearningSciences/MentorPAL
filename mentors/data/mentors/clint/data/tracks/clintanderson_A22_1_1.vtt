00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.770
So, the difference between an officer and enlisted member, they kind of

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.700
 meld together once you get higher in superiority but the real difference

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.620
 is when you start. An E1 or an E2 seaman or airman, basically

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.540
 their only goal, their only purpose in life is to do a technical job

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.470
 whereas an officer, an ensign, his day one is actually managing a

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.390
 group of people. Obviously, they're both training but the goal of what

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.310
 they're supposed to do is slightly different. As you get higher,

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.230
 as you get to become E5, 6 or 7 for enlisted or you become a lieutenant,

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.160
 that's an O3 for an officer, then you start going into management

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.080
 and supervising people. So, at least on the ship, you would see that

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.000
 the E7s, the Chiefs and O3s, the lieutenants are working side by

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.930
 side, pretty much doing the same thing but in the lower ranks, then

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.850
 enlisted is technical, officers are management.
