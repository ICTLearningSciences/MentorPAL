00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.600
There's the Master Chief of the Navy, there's the Secretary of Defense,

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.350
 obviously the President and Vice-President, that's the hierarchy.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.100
 Obviously if you're in active duty, then you have your Commanding Officer,

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.850
 you have your XO and those are, that's the President and Vice-President

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.600
 of your little command. But specifically, within your work

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.350
 center, the Chief is the guy. Chief, Senior Chief, Master Chief, those

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.100
 are the people that are in charge of all the enlisted people and

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.850
 they're your whole world. That's your mom and your dad.
