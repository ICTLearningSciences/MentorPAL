The biggest barrier to entry, to join the navy, and basically the military

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.320
 in general, is that you have to be able to follow directions. And

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.560
 even though that sounds like a very small task, it shows up everywhere

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.790
 in everything that you do, from from doing the simplest of tasks

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:27.030
 to writing your name to you know making a list of things to do in

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.260
 a complex procedure you know, and everything that's in between those

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.500
 two, those two distinct elements. So of course the people who are

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.730
 really bright, they get the more complex jobs you know, the Navy is

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.970
 really good about that, but no matter what your job is, you're going

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.200
 to find yourself faced with a complex situation, and it's very important

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.440
 to follow directions because people's lives are at stake. You

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.670
 can actually get someone killed with some of the things that you do.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.910
 Even if you're a painter or a boat driver or an electrician, no matter

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.140
 what you do it's gonna affect somebody some way, and you're not

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.380
 really familiar with exactly how it's going to affect people. So you

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.610
 have to really do the job that people tell you to do because you can't

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.850
 see all the dangers that are associated with it.
