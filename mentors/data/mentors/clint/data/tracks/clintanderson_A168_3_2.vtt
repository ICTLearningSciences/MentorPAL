Our uniform ranges a lot from clothes that you wear everyday like this,

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 these are camouflage, this is a camouflage shirt that I'm wearing

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.850
 and matching pants and really hard, rock hard boots to make sure that

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 you don't stub your toe. And you can go on up to your dress blues

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.850
 which is like when you're going to a very special occasion, maybe some

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.850
 kind of ceremony, that you need to look very presentable, you wouldn't

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 work in your dress blues. So other uniforms that we wear, I wear

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 khakis. Chiefs which is E7, E8, E9 and officers they've wear things

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.850
 call khakis, which is like a nice pressed uniform, it's brown with

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.850
 white instead of this blue, and matching pants. You can work in them

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.850
 but generally those are people that kind of oversee people working.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 The workers on the other hand they can wear these things called coveralls,

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.850
 which is it brings you back to your five year old days, which

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.850
 is like a one piece body suit. You can put one leg in, one leg in,

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.850
 put your arms in, then zip it all the way up and coveralls look like

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.850
 the things that people that change oil, their clothes, they wear.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.850
 So if you think about someone changing your oil, he gets on that like

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.850
 sliding machine thing, then goes up under the car. That whole entire

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.850
 uniform is, that's what coveralls look like, and they're all blue,

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.850
 except they're for the Navy.
