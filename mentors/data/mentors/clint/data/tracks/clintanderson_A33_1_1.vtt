00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.050
So, from the day that you join the Navy, you're going to find that you

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.250
 have similar past to people that are in your same field. So, you know,

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.450
 there are people who are very motivated and want to become the Master

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.650
 Chief of the Navy. You have some people who, maybe were criminals

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.850
 before and joined the military to prevent going to jail, to be given

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.050
 a shot for normal life before they winded up in a bad place. So,

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.250
 you have the whole gamut of people and different career paths, different

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.450
 intelligence, different motivations for being in the military.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.650
 So, in general, people of a similar quality tend to hang out with

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.850
 the same people. So, people who like to drink all the time, you'll find

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.050
 that they're, you know, have this one house that they always go

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.250
 to, over and over. People that are very very motivated study all the

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.450
 time. You'll find that they probably share a house with people who

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.650
 want to become an officer. So, you also find that that's very apparent

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.850
 in the ports that you go to. So, for me, I didn't want to. I wasn't

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.050
 a drinker at that time. Not, not very much. So I'd go into port and

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.250
 I try to tap people like, "Hey, do you want to go see some place

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.450
 fun?", "Do you want to go climb a mountain or visit a castle? So, once

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.650
 we do that, then there's very limited chance of, that we'd find problems.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.850
 Some of the people who, like, are really, you know, really

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.050
 eager to have fun, the very first place that they go to is the bar and

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.250
 people similar to them are there and you can get lots of people like

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.450
 that, then probably, you can find yourself into trouble. So, as

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.650
 long as you're aware of that, as long as you're not somebody that drinks

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.850
 all the time and you know, wants to get me in trouble who's just

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.050
 trying to, like, visit ports and once I'm, even though I don't want

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.250
 to drink all the time, I have to realize that if I visit people that

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.450
 are drinking all the time, then I might get in trouble as well. Like,

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.650
 as long as you can kind of, you're aware of your specific sphere,

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.850
 then you'll have a much better time in the military.
