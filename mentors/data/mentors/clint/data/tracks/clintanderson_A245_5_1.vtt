When you're working in a technological field, you can be faced with lots

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.470
 of self-doubt about how good you are. I don't know as much computer

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.280
 science as I should. I don't know how to program as well as I want.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.090
 I'm studying nuclear technology but it seems everybody around me

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.900
 knows more than me. So, how do I handle those situations? I faced all

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.710
 of those situations that I just told you, myself and number one, you

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.520
 just have to realize that you're smarter than you know. I hear that

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.330
 a lot but you should realize that the military will give you all

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.140
 of the training that you need to be successful in your job. Otherwise,

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.950
 they won't let you work. Otherwise, they won't let you put people's

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.750
 lives in danger. So, just understand that you probably will not be

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.560
 put in a demanding watch or job without the right tools. Besides that

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.370
 though, let's say you just want to, you know, be promoted in your

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.180
 career and that really does, it really does matter whether you know

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.990
 your job very well or whether you just know it so so. And in that

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.800
 case, pick up your nearest book and if you haven't really studied in

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.610
 high school or in you're youth that much, then now is the time during

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.420
 this job, during your technological job or during your military job

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.230
 to actually do your homework. If you don't do your homework and you

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.040
 don't know your job well, then you're at fault for not being promoted

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.850
 as you should. So, try to pick a book and learn a little bit.
