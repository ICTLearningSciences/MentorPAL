00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.490
My best friend in the military was someone that I went to A school with.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.120
 And I think for the most part people, people stay with the people

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.760
 who were with them in A school, the initial school that you go to.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.400
 For the most part, for the first four years. His name was Will. We both

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.030
 did electrical engineering together for A school. We split up, but

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.670
 when I went to my first shift, an aircraft. It was in San Diego.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.300
 He had the opportunity to tell the navy that, and they can kind of hook

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.940
 up people who were in the same school together, so that happened.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.580
 So we spent our first aircraft carrier as well. And based on that,

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.210
 you know we lived together, and he eventually got married and we're

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.850
 still friends to this day.
