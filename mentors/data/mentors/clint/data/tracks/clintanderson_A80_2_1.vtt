00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.350
I moved a lot when I was in the military and I'm really happy about that

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.850
 because you keep hearing about America and how it's different in

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.350
 different places. So, I got to visit the four corners of America and

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.850
 I got to see the different lifestyles. So, I grew up in Alabama which

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.350
 is, like, down south in a black community. Everybody around me, my

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.850
 neighbors, everyone was black and then, you know, you go to school

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.350
 that's mixed but I got to see that. I grew up some of my time in Flint,

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.850
 Michigan which is a very urban place but it's on the poorer side.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.350
 So, that glove part, you know, I know all about that. And when I

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.850
 joined the military, then my first school was in Charleston, South Carolina

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.350
 which is another down south place but I got to see, you know,

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.850
 it's little bit more mixed. Then I went up to New York, Albany which

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.350
 is nice green country and I got to visit 'The New York City', you

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.850
 know, very often so that was really cool for me, to visit such a famous

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.350
 place. Later on, I got stationed in San Diego and it's super hot,

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.850
 well, it's good temperature, it can be very hot as opposed to New

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.350
 York which was freezing cold and it's a very big city. You know, it's

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.850
 my style of, I'm not a country backwards boy, you know, like, climbing

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.350
 mountains and hunting. I am a city guy myself. So, I got to see

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.850
 San Diego which is, like, I'm from California originally so that's

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.350
 up my tree. And then, I finally got to visit Bremerton, Washington

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.850
 which is in the middle of Washington state and it's kind of country,

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.350
 you can own bigger houses there, you know, for much cheaper. So, it's

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.850
 much less expensive than California and I knew a lot of people who

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.350
 used to be Californians but then they, you know, changed over to Washington

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.850
 because the life is a lot easier. They liked having a five

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.350
 bedroom house with a big green yard for the kids to play in and nice

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.850
 and quiet neighborhoods, you know, so, a lot of people change. So,

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.350
 I got to see all those and eventually, I realized out of all the places

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.850
 that I visited in America, I'm a California guy.
