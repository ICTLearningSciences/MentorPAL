A lot of people ask whether you can switch between branches. If you can

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.520
 go from the army to the airforce, from the marines to the Coast Guard.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.850
 It really, I haven't seen it so much, but it really depends on

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.180
 what's going on in the world. When I was going through nuke school,

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.520
 there was this program that you could go from being in the Navy, I think

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.850
 it was called the blue to green program where they were they were

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.180
 looking for helicopter pilots. So they were sucking people from other

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.520
 branches to get to this undermanned job. But for the most part,

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.850
 it's really not possible.
