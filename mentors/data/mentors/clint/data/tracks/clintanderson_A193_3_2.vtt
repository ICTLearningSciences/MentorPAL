00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.810
Some of the most important decisions that I've faced have to do with morality

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.770
 I would say. So here's what I mean. The most important thing that

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.730
 you can do in the military is follow directions, but not everybody

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.680
 does that, unfortunately, and your tasks as a supervisor is to

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.640
 confront these things and take care of them appropriately. So this is

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.600
 what I mean. Let's say that there is somebody on the ship, coming

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.560
 onto the ship any he's drunk and he's not supposed to be drunk. What

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.520
 do you do? So you could either grab him by the collar and take him to the

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.470
 local Master at Arms this person in trouble right, and that's

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.430
 the right thing to do. Another right thing to do would be to chastise

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.390
 him, to handle it in house to make sure that he doesn't do it again

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.350
 to kind of supervise and mentor him, if you think that he's that

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.310
 type of person so you don't have to necessarily ruin his career. So

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:10.270
 basically it's a morality question, the type of personality that you

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.230
 have and how willing to stick to the books you are to make sure that

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.180
 you do the right thing. When it comes to things that are going on

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.140
 in the plants, things that are going on in the engineering field there's

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.100
 no morality involved. If that thing is leaking you don't think

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.060
 hey you know like should I fix it or not, it's not that big. No if it's

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.020
 leaking, if X then Y. But when you're dealing with people, people

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.970
 with personalities, people with emotions, people with families, you

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.930
 have to really take all of that into consideration and to determine

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.890
 the wise thing to do, not necessarily the thing that's written in

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.850
 the book.
