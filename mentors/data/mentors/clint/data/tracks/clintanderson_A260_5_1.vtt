00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.970
In college I was pretty involved in a lot of things. At my current university,

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.100
 USC, I am involved in archery, shooting bows and arrows. At

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.230
 my undergrad UC Berkeley I was a resident computing consultant which

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.350
 is kind of a job to help students get their wifi and their computer

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.470
 set up. When I was in Japan I was part of that aikido club which meant

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.600
 that, it's kind of like martial arts where you people attack you

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.730
 and you put them on the ground a certain way. So I was pretty involved

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.850
 in college.
