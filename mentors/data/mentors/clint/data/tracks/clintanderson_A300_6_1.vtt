00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.560
I've been thinking a lot about my future career is what I'm supposed to

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.280
 do and in the next five years I expect to keep going on with my education

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.990
 maybe go to a PhD or get some kind of advanced degree and then

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.710
 maybe later on have my own job maybe work for the federal government

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.420
 probably NASA or a continuing on with the current company I'm with

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.140
 which is the Institute for Creative Technologies they make virtuality

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.850
 reality stuff.
