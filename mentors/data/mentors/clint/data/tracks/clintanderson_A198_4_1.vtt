A lot of my inspiration comes from myself. Particularly, I'm a designer

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.620
 so I just sometimes just sit by myself and I think, "Well, what problems

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.000
 does the world need taking care of?" You know, like, there's

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.390
 water that needs to be had in Africa or there's, I don't know, a building

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.770
 that needs to be built bigger or there needs to be like, a different

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.160
 type of game that I want to see in multi-person online role-playing

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.540
 games or something. So, lot of it comes from myself. Of course

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.930
 I can watch videos like YouTube or I can you know, hear people talking

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.310
 and then like, get inspirational from that but I think that the

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.700
 best types of ideas come from, you know, your own past, the things

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.080
 that you witnessed in your life and then you make new things, something

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.470
 that no one has ever thought of. Those are the best types of ideas

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.850
 that I think should be created.
