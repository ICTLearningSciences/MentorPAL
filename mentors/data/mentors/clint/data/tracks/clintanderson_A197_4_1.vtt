00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.100
I'm trying to solve lots of different problems that are very educationally

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.350
 oriented. So, I want to bring technology to the classroom. I noticed

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.600
 that when I was in school, that the lectures were boring, from

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.850
 teachers, you know, writing up there on the blackboard, that the books,

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.100
 you know, they're kind of dry and you know, the words are plain.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.350
 and then I go home and I see entertainment. I watch YouTube videos

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.600
 and I watch Netflix and I'm, you know, like, the videos that I watch

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.850
 are like, very educationally oriented. You know, I watch physics videos

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.100
 and I watch computer science videos so I try to, I would like

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.350
 to bring that style of education into the classroom because it's more

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.600
 interesting. So, I'm trying to solve that problem when it comes to

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.850
 things that I want to see come in the future.
