I don't think that computer science is really ethnically diverse because

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.770
 in general, engineering is not ethnically diverse. For example, when

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:18.730
 I was at Berkeley, I was taking my artificial intelligence class

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.680
 and there are about four hundred people. There there was one other

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.640
 African American female, she always sat in the front and there was me.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.600
 Besides that, it was basically whites and Asians. For the military,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.560
 I'm an Electrician's Mate on the nuclear side and that's not very

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.520
 ethnically diverse either. That's because nuclear technology and basically

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.470
 engineering, is kind of a higher level field and unfortunately,

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.430
 blacks and Hispanics don't really shine in those areas as much as

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.390
 whites and Asians do. So, the military is very diverse but blacks

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.350
 and Hispanics are usually in the fields that don't require as much technical

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.310
 thinking but at least on the civilian side, at least in school,

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.270
 Berkeley had lots of different cultures but they're mainly in the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.230
 humanities section not so much the engineering section. That's something

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:36.180
 that I'm trying to change myself. That's the reason that I'm

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.140
 in computer science at the first place because I want to do education

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.100
 so I can help people like me, you know, who were young and wanted

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.060
 to have some kind of inspiration to do technically oriented jobs but

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.020
 I didn't really know where to start, so. It has a long way to go.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.970
 In fact, even at USC, out of the whole entire games department, I'm

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.930
 the only black person that's there. I don't think I saw, there were

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.890
 maybe two or three Hispanic people and this is a field of maybe, several

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.850
 hundred people. So, it has a long way to go.
