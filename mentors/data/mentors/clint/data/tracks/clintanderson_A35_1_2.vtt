00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.060
So, at the end of their active duty tour, you have a lot of options in

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.280
 front of you. Number one, you can try to go back into the military

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.490
 if you like the career. If you wanted to stay in the same field, then

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.710
 you could. So, for instance, the aircraft mechanics. Yes, they were

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.920
 fixing jets and they were working on jets. So, there aren't that many

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.140
 jets that they could work on outside but Boeing is eager to hire

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.350
 those people. You can see how jets and 747s kind of, are the same thing.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.560
 So, you can find something in your field. For me, personally I

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.780
 didn't actually like my field completely, enough to make a full career

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.990
 out of it. So, I changed. Instead of Electrician's Mate, I became

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.210
 a computer scientist which is something completely different but,

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.420
 all of the basic skills that I received, the math, the physics, the

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.640
 thinking logically about things, they still apply to my computer science.
