Natural language processing is pretty cool it's one of computer sciences'

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.520
 most thoughtful creations basically you ask me any question and

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.850
 then the computer that's behind me is going to look at the question

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.180
 that you asked and find in their memory banks something that's very

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.520
 very similar and through their magic it chooses the best one, spits

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.850
 it out, and hopefully it's a good fit to your question.
