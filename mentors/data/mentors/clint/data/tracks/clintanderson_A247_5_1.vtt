00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.140
I think success really depends on an individual's desire. First off, I

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.440
 have to say success is what you make of it. But for me personally,

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.730
 if I wake up happy, smiling, if I look forward to going to work, if

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.030
 I have some people around me, one, two, five that really care about

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:27.320
 me, that care about my progression, as a older people who will take

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.610
 care of me. If I have those people around me, then I call that successful.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.910
 Right now, I think I'm successful. Now, many people also choose

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.200
 to say, "Well, success depends on what you want to do in the future"

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.500
 and for that one, I say, "If you're doing all of the things that

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.790
 it takes to get you from point A to point B. So, for instance, for

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.090
 me, if I wanted to go to Stanford, if I wanted to become an entrepreneur

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.380
 later on and own my own business, am I doing the things that are

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.670
 required to go to those goals?" and it's a simple answer, yes or no.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.970
 If I'm not, if I'm playing video games all day, if I'm just talking

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.260
 with friends and drinking alcohol and not really doing the things

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.560
 that set me up to get to that place, then I say that I need to start

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.850
 doing those things to get my life straight. That's unsuccessful.
