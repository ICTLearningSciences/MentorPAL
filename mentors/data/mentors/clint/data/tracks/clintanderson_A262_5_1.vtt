If I had to do school all over again, of course I would try harder. The

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.770
 goal when you're at college is to get a 4.0 in as many classes as

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.230
 you can, and even though it doesn't really matter as long as you get

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.700
 the information then that's the only thing that matters, when you try

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.160
 to go on to get a masters or a PHD, they really do look at your at

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.620
 your grades. They also look at your intelligence, how well you know

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.080
 it, if you're an expert or not. So I did waste a lot of time, I did

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.540
 play lots of video games, I did watch lots of Netflix, and maybe college

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.000
 isn't the right place to do that. You have the whole rest of

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.470
 your life to really enjoy things to the maximum, but college is the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.930
 place to study, so of course I should relax a little bit, but I wish

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.390
 I would have really studied a little bit harder. So that's something

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.850
 that I would have changed.
