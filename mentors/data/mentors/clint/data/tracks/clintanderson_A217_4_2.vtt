If you have a bump in the road in your professional career, you have to

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.520
 shake it off. There are many times that I personally had lots of bumps

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.350
 in my military career, that it didn't work out the way that I wanted

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.180
 to. So, for instance, an example is, I wanted to go to the Naval

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.020
 Academy when I first joined the military. They didn't accept me and

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.850
 I thought that was, it's the last time that I could apply. I was

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.680
 22 when I joined or when I joined and tried to apply and the limit they

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.520
 can be is 23 and I was at that point. So, the next year I wasn't

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.350
 able to apply and it just, like, set me back. It felt like it really

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.180
 set me back. It's one of the biggest heartbreaks that I had in my

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.020
 life. But, you kind of, make a plan B, you look at the future, kind

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.850
 of, see, like, where I want to go and take that goal and you put it

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.680
 on your new plan B and then it should, you know, if you have the right

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.520
 determination and drive, then you should still get back on track

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.350
 somehow. So, in order to get back on track, you have to talk to your

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.180
 people, you have to talk to your mentors if you have any, you have

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.020
 to, you know, take something from yourself and say, "You know what,

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.850
 even though I won't get there as fast as I was going to or as easily

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.680
 as I was going to, is it still a goal worth going on this new path?"

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.520
 So, for me, one of the reasons that I wanted to go was, obviously

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.350
 to make sure that I take care of people, that I, you know, I present

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.180
 a good, I'm a good worker for the American people. So, I took that

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.020
 goal and I just did it through normal universities, I did through my

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.850
 nuclear technology work, I did it through research that I'm doing right

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.680
 now and I still think that my end goal, which is making cool products

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.520
 for, you know, cool computer science products and, you know,

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.350
 awesome new and exciting things. I'm still going to do that no matter

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.180
 what. So, if you have a bump in your professional career, just take

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.020
 a reset, do some extra education, maybe talk to a lot of people to

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.850
 get you back on track and you'll be fine.
