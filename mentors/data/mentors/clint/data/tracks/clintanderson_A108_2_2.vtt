00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.690
The biggest advice that I could present to somebody who went through a

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.530
 tough life similar to me. My life wasn't extremely tough, it's the

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.370
 way that I looked at it, other people would say that I had a tough life.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.210
 I mean I've seen roaches in my bathroom I've had mice crawl over

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.050
 my feet. I've, I've smelled gunpowder you know, from outside. I've

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.890
 had a pimp you know, hit his prostitute outside my door. These are

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.730
 things that I've experienced and I gotta say you know, as much as, as

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.570
 strong as I want to be for saying you know, it didn't affect me I'm

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.410
 strong but I think that you know, it really changed my life and I

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.250
 know that a lot of people, especially ones that join the military have

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.090
 had similar careers you know my story is not unique. So I think one

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.930
 of the things that has helped me in order to look at my past better

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.770
 is to have different experiences. Another thing that I'm proud of

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.610
 is the fact that my dad was in the army and I got to go to Germany.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.450
 So just being in that other environment, being surrounded by German

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.290
 kids, needing to speak the German language, you know eating bratwurst

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.130
 you don't like, having that different experience allowed me to come

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.970
 back to Flint and say you know, this isn't life, this is one part

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.810
 of life, but there are people in Florida that are you know going to

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.650
 Disneyland, people in Germany you know doing Octoberfest, there are

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.490
 people in Japan you know eating Ramanan watching anime. This is just

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.330
 one small sliver, and if you can somehow escape from that environment,

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.170
 or even maybe do something within that environment to make it better

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.010
 you know, then you can see that you don't have to be disheartened

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.850
 by your, by your surroundings. It's just what you make of it.
