00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.610
My life is really full of distractions, especially when I'm doing something

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.380
 important, when I'm doing something that takes a lot of physical

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.140
 energy, then distractions abound. So for instance, one of the worst

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.910
 ones, or maybe the best ones, that I found when I was undergrad,

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.670
 was Netflix, watching movies. There was this time that I would just

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.440
 watch it day in and day out, and it was really messing up my homework.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.200
 Eventually, I came around. How did I come around? I guess a few bad

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.970
 grades, or maybe one or two projects that you know, really, really

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.730
 sucked, and then you get your senses. Right now, my biggest distraction

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.500
 is video games. I'm trying to learn Japanese every day, and I

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.260
 fail every single day because video games are taking the spot, and it

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.030
 shouldn't be like that. Another one would be when you have too many

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.790
 friends, you're sitting there going to bars and drinking and, you

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.560
 know, kind of chatting. When they ask you to go out with them every

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.320
 day, then it can be really, very distracting. So in each of these cases,

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.090
 you just kind of figure out what your purpose is, why you're there,

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.850
 and then try to get back on track the best you can.
