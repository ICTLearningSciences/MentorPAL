00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.440
STEM can really differ across the world in many different ways. In America

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.030
 engineering, at least for the schools that I went to and the area

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.610
 that I'm familiar with, which is the lower class urban area of California

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:23.200
 and Alabama and Michigan. Right, they don't really focus so

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.790
 much on engineering as a cultural experience. They say it's really

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:34.380
 difficult and it's pretty much for the the top twenty or ten percent

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.970
 of the students. You have to be smart to do it. That's not so much

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.560
 the case let's say in Japan and China where all students are expected

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:51.140
 to have a very very thorough understanding of mathematics and science.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.730
 Even to get into college you should be, you should have pretty

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.320
 high SAT scores, or their version of the SAT, so you consider that to

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.910
 even go to a good college. Not only that it's taught from when they're

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:13.500
 really young to really older that just you know fill in your weak

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.090
 points, whereas in America they say well if you're not good at it

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.670
 well there are other things to do why don't you try music right. So

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.260
 I guess we have a little more freedom about what we can do whereas

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.850
 STEM is really expected in other countries.
