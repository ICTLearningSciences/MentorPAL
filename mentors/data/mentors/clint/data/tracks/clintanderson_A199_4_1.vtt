00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.200
When I am coding myself, there's this time that you're like, typing and

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.550
 you're thinking about, like the next algorithm that you're going to

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.900
 write and you start to get into this flow where you kind of see the

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.250
 future and it's all a matter of like, your hands typing down the words

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.600
 so that you can get to that point but at that time, it's not like

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.950
 you're typing, it's not like your thinking of things at the time.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.300
 You already know where you want to go and it's just a matter of getting

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.650
 there as fast as possible. So, that's what I mean when I say flow,

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.000
 like, it's kind of like, if you play video games and you know how

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.350
 you're supposed to beat the boss and then you can see the person on

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.700
 the screen running and jumping and you know, sliding and stuff but

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.050
 you're not thinking about the way that your hands are controlling the

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.400
 character. You know, you're not thinking about B, B, up, down, left,

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.750
 right. You're just thinking of the person running and jumping and

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.100
 so, that's what homework is for me. That's what, like, when I do my

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.450
 start-up, that's what it is for me, you know, I see the end goal and

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.800
 that time, you know, between the time that where you are and the

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.150
 final product, that's the flow that I mean where it's like, you can

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.500
 just get into it and it's really fun and you can do it all day, because

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.850
 it's, you know, so inspirational.
