00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.680
I've been deployed three times. I joined the Navy when I was 21 years

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.520
 old, in 2000 and then I stayed there for eight years. So, the first

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.350
 two years were for school and then the last six years, that's the time

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.180
 I was on the aircraft carrier and during that time, I went out to

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.020
 the sea, deployment, for six months each, well, six months then seven

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.850
 months then eight months within two year sprints. So, in two years,

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.680
 you're supposed to go on one deployment, six months time. Then, you're

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.520
 supposed to come back for a year, I'm sorry, you're supposed to

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.350
 come back for a year and a half. So, six months deployment, one and

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.180
 a half years, you know, stationed at home, six months deployment,

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.020
 one and a half years stationed at home. So, because, I was in for six

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.850
 years, I did three deployments.
