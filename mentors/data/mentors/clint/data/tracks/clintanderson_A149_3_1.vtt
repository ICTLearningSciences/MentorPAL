00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.850
Something that a lot of people don't really realize about computer science

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.850
 is just how easy it is. Yes it can be very difficult. You sometimes

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.850
 have to figure out algorithms you have to figure out the best way

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.850
 to put the light that comes on the screen based on the moving of

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 the characters, and you have to like, you have to understand that the

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.850
 computer is like calculating thousands of things per second you know,

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.850
 actually millions of things per second. So you have to like tweak

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.850
 and optimize the things that are, that you tell the computer to do

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.850
 to make it. So all that's very very difficult. However, some of computer

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 science is really really easy I know that some people who had

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.850
 never done computers at all, can you know study for a week or two, and

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.850
 then put things on the computer like web design or something. So

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.850
 then based on what they learn over the next like a few weeks they can

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.850
 actually make a career out of that, and that's computer science as

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 well. So it ranges from very easy to very hard, and lot of people think

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.850
 aw, computer science is so difficult. Eh, it's as difficult as

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.850
 you can make it. It's as difficult as how hard you're willing to try.
