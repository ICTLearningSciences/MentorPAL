00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.430
Now that I'm not in the active duty Navy, I joined the US Navy Reserves

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.020
 and I've been there for about the last eight years. So, that job isn't

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.600
 extremely difficult. They say that it's two days per month, two

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.180
 weeks per year and I've actually worked a lot more than that but it's

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.770
 a minimal time in the military. So, I've had a lot of time to do

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.350
 whatever I wanted to. I've split it between working at jobs. For instance,

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.930
 my job is, I'm a Japanese teacher in Japan but also work for

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.520
 the University of Southern California Institute for Creative Technologies

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.100
 and I find little pieces of jobs here and there. So, I'm a part

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.680
 of a start-up. A computer science start-up working with virtual reality.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.270
 I also go to school. So, I'm a full-time master's student when

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.850
 I'm back in America and I am studying game development.
