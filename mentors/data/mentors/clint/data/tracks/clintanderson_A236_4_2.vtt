00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.240
Since joining the computer science field, I've had lots of different interests.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.640
 For instance, I didn't really know what web design was, but

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.030
 when I started to learn what cascading style sheets were and how to

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.420
 put blocks on the screen and, you know, what a website was and how

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.810
 to read from a server, as I started to understand these things, like,

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.210
 "Oh, you know, that seems kind of interesting. Maybe I'll be a web

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.600
 designer." And then, you start to learn about, like, the operating

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.990
 system and I realize, like, what scheduling is, there's lots of stuff

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.390
 about operating systems and I decided, "Oh hey, let's run away from

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.780
 that because it's not for me." The more things I learned about computer

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.170
 science, the more focused I became in what it is I wanted to

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.560
 do. I always knew I liked to play games and after I started learning

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.960
 about what designers do, I finally focused in on that aspect of computer

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.350
 science, which is, I'm not the best programmer, there are programmers

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.740
 much better than me, I'm not the best artist, obviously, you

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.140
 know, those people with graphic design, you know, they do their own

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.530
 thing but what I did like to do is, kind of, go to a whiteboard, draw

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.920
 things out, kind of, explain what it is I wanted other people to

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.310
 do and myself included sometimes too and then have that be implemented.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.710
 So, the more I did that, the more I said, "You know what? Design

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.100
 is probably, it's been the funnest part of my job. It's the thing that

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.490
 has the least debugging, which, I hate debugging." Debugging is

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.890
 when you have to, like, figure out the small little tiny portion wrong

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.280
 with your code, you know, and it could be, like, hidden in, you know,

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.670
 thousands and thousands of lines of code, you know, I hate those

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.060
 things. So, designers, they do the funnest part of the job without

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.460
 all of the negative benefits of finding small areas that could take

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.850
 such a long time.
