00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.240
So, it depends on what your rank is but the people that are above you,

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.630
 they're the ones who kind of tell you what it is you're supposed to

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.020
 be doing. So, if you're one of the lower pay grades, then, in the morning,

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.410
 you kind of just sit around and you wait for them to pass out

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.790
 the work to everyone. A Chief will come in and say, "Okay you're on

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.180
 pumps today, you're on valves today, you're fixing the drains today,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.570
 you're in the bilge today." Chiefs are the ones who actually tell

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.960
 people what to do. So, they don't need to be told what it is they're

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.350
 supposed to be doing because they only have one job, which is to hand

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.740
 out the work. On the other hand, Officers, has basically the same

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.130
 pay grade, the same direction of flow. So, for instance, an O1, O2,

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.520
 O3, they're told by the higher level people who they're supposed to

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.910
 be managing, "You're supposed to be tagging along with these people",

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.290
 or I think for Officers, their main goal is just to be, to train

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.680
 themselves. So, they hang out in their room or they hang out down in

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.070
 the plants, just studying. So, Officers have a lot more opportunity

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.460
 to self-study. Enlisted people, they will know exactly what they're

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.850
 doing for the first two or three years of their career.
