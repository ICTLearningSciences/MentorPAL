You can change career fields after a while, either in the military because

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.050
 you've been doing your job for a while and you can choose your

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.650
 next command that you go to or you can try to do a job that just requires

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.250
 your pay grade but doesn't require a specific job. Like, for instance,

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.850
 Electrician's Mate, I am an E7, so I can do an E7 job, a Chief

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.450
 job that doesn't require Electrician's Mate itself but those are

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.050
 few and far in between. So, once you get out of the military, if that's

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.650
 the choice that you choose to make, then I think that the skills

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.250
 that they provide you, for instance, math and science and taking orders,

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.850
 those can be applied anywhere. So, as long as I'm in a technical

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.450
 field, I think as an Electrician's Mate, I can do anything from

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.050
 working on aircraft carriers to working in the academic field. Right

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.650
 now, I'm a computer science major and I'm still using some of the Electrician's

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.250
 Mate things that I learned. So, your opportunities to expand

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.850
 your career greatly widen after you get out of military.
