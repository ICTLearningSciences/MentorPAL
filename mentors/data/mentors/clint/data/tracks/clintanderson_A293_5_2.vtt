00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.760
In my life, I've been presented with many opportunities to be challenged

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.670
 with new skills. One of them would be to learn a new computer science

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.580
 language. So, for instance, let's say I know C# but now, I need

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.490
 to learn a new gaming language, it's called Unity. So, I've never used

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.400
 this tool before but I know C# which is inside it somewhere. So,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.300
 that means I have to learn this new skill that's based on the programming

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.210
 that I've done before. So, in that case, I might have to take

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.120
 lots of online tutorials, I might have to ask lots of friends, like,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.030
 "Hey, look over my shoulder. Am I doing this right? What does this

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.940
 button do?" That happens all the time. Maybe several times per year,

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.850
 I'm faced with some kind of new technique, new skill, new program

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.760
 that I'm supposed to learn. In the military, it's very similar. So,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.670
 once you're on the ship and you've been there for a couple of years,

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.580
 you know all of the equipment, you know all of the sets that's you're

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.490
 supposed to learn. However, you could be faced with going to a new

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.400
 class. So, for instance, I am recently going to go to Command Career

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.300
 Counselor School, where I'm going to go to a two week class and they're

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.210
 going to teach me all about the books that I am supposed to read

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.120
 and some manuals that I'm supposed to present to other people, that's

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.030
 an whole new skill, with concepts that I've never seen before

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.940
 and even in the military, you're going to be faced with one or two opportunities

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.850
 per year to really push yourself to learn.
