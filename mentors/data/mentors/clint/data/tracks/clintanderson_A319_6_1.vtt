Seeing myself through someone else's eyes is pretty cool it's kind like

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.560
 looking through a mirror and I've never, other than staring at the

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.420
 mirror you know like doing my eyebrows and stuff, I never really liked

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.280
 looked at myself before especially heard myself talking. They actually

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.140
 say that when you hear yourself speak it's very different and

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.990
 I think that's true so it's been pretty cool to see what I would be

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.850
 like as another person I wish to ask myself questions some time.
