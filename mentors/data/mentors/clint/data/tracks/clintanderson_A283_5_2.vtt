If you want to study STEM and you want to study something humanities oriented

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.030
 like music, then those opportunities are available. What I would

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.610
 suggest is you should first figure out what type of job you want

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.200
 to do, and then try to combine the classes that you're taking and

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.790
 the job that you have into both of them. As an example, I wanted to

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.380
 do computer science education. Therefore in my classes, I took computer

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.970
 science as a major and education as a minor. I'm really glad I got

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.560
 to see both of those parts of my undergraduate university. When I'm

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.140
 doing computer science, it's very math oriented, science oriented,

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.730
 lots of homework every night. The education part was very writing

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.320
 intensive, talking and debating, and I like both of them. The reason

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.910
 I chose those majors is because I knew what my future job was going

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.500
 to be. So if your job is very technically oriented, then I suggest

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.090
 that you stick with an engineering major and really focus hard at that.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.670
 But if that's not your cup of tea, kind of like me, then that's

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.260
 when should try to focus, that's when you have the opportunity to do

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.850
 both of them.
