00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.580
When you're on your ship you have a lot of opportunities available to

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.320
 you. Now I won't lie, the bigger the ship you're on the more opportunities

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.050
 that are available. So you have a really small ship let's say

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.780
 a destroyer, that's not small but like the destroyer is I guess a ship

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.520
 that has maybe a couple thousand people on it. It's kind of like

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.250
 a high school you could say, the size of a high school. And there aren't

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.980
 that many things to do. I've never been on a destroyer but I just

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.720
 know from my experience with the aircraft carrier. It has to have

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.450
 less than what I had and at least for an aircraft carrier which has

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.180
 five thousand people usually. When we're on deployment we have, it goes

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.920
 up to eight thousand people when you add all the people that come

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.650
 in with airplanes, and the people that take care of the airplanes,

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.380
 and the extra officers and enlisted people. Eight thousand people

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.120
 is the size of a small city. So on an aircraft carrier we have our

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.850
 own post office, we have our own little recreation center. We have a

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.580
 couple of places for fitness, but in general it is a war craft vessel. Therefore

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.320
 there aren't that many, there are limited places that

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.050
 you can do, that you can have on the ship that cater to entertainment.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.780
 So people find their own entertainment. So for me, my entertainment

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.520
 on the ship was I'd watch movies all the time. So everybody has their

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.250
 own little laptop or their DVD player, you can rent movies from

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.980
 the little recreation center that's there. They had bands in little

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.720
 hidden spots of the ship. So there would be drums and guitars and you

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.450
 know like even keyboards all hidden, but that did they make space

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.180
 and you know they play as loud as they want. Obviously the fitness

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.920
 centers are there, and you can see card playing all over the place.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.650
 Whenever there is a rack, a living quarter, then there's this little

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:13.380
 table outside you know like three or four of them. With couches to

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.120
 watch TV to watch movies and to play cards right there, so that's how

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.850
 we spent our deployments.
