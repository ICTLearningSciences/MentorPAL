00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.380
When I started my career, then I was an E3, which is the third rank that

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.900
 you can be in the hierarchy. Not a lot was expected of me. I get

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.430
 to work, they say, "Go fix this pump", "Go work with that guy" and then

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.960
 at the end of the work day, around like four or five o'clock, then,

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.480
 probably not much was really expected of me. They'd say, you know,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.010
 "Just go to your bed" or "We'll see you later". It depends on whether

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.530
 you're on deployment or whether you're stationed at home but you

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:37.060
 might have to work, maybe one or two hours extra every other day.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.590
 However, as I progressed, when I became an E6, which is a first class

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.110
 or a Chief which is an E7, then, after that normal work day of telling

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.640
 people what to do, you know, you're there the same exact time as

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.170
 they are, you have to do, like, the follow up at the end. So, for

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.690
 instance, they get done at the end of the day. So, now that you have

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.220
 that information, while they get to go home or they get to, like, you

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.740
 know, have that downtime, you have to go report that to other people.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.270
 You have to do the paperwork that other people are requiring. So,

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.800
 you have to wait till the normal work is done and then you have to

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.320
 add on the supervisory specialization that you have to give at the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.850
 very very end. So, you work more as you get higher in the rank.
