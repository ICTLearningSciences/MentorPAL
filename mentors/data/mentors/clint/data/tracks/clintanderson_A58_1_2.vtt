00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.970
When you're in the military, you're given a lot of technical training

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.090
 but we're fortunate that we don't really have to apply that technical

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.210
 training. When you're working, you have this list of things that you're

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.330
 supposed to do and you do it, you have this list of procedures

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.450
 that you're supposed to follow and you follow them and when you don't

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.570
 know something, that's wrong with something that you're working on,

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.690
 like a pump or a valve or a voltage regulator, there's already a

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.810
 list, a well-guided list of the procedures that you're supposed to follow.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.930
 So, I didn't deal with technical problems so much in that regard,

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.050
 however that doesn't mean that we don't figure out technical things

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.170
 all the time. So, especially during your A school and your power

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.290
 school, you're presented with, you know, college level problems all

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.410
 the time. So, for instance, here is an electrical schemata and you're

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.530
 not getting voltage at this, at this point. So, how is that possible?

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.650
 Or, this is a picture of a pump and for some reason, there's water

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.770
 coming from this part. Please troubleshoot how you would figure

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.890
 out where this water is faulting at. So, after A school, you're presented

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.010
 with those types of problems pretty often throughout the time

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.130
 that you're in the Navy. You don't see them so often. When you do see

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.250
 it, it's a really big problem because, like, we do so much preventive

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.370
 maintenance and we do so much work that you're definitely not supposed

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.490
 to see them. But when you do have that problem, it's a big group

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.610
 effort and it's really hard to like, say that one person actually

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.730
 figured it out but you're presented with those small theoretical

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.850
 problems all the time.
