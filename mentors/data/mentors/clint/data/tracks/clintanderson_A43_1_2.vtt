00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.250
So, this uniform that we have is, first of all, I like the colors. Makes

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.650
 you look really really military, if you can say that. There's this

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.050
 person, Steve Jobs. He used to wear the same exact thing every single

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.450
 day and he was very successful as a computer manager and he said

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.850
 that he wore the same exact thing because he didn't have to think about

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.250
 what to wear every single day. So, you get into that impression

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.650
 here, you know, like you know what you're going to wear so there's

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.050
 like very very little thought process of what it's going to be. Is it

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.450
 going to be the same thing I wore yesterday or is it going to be this

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.850
 new fresh one but it's going to be cammies today, so.
