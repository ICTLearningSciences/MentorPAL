00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.680
One of the most difficult parts of my education would have to be when

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.520
 I try to balance my home life and my school life. The more you put at

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.350
 school, the less you can do outside of school obviously. So if you

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.180
 don't have that much time, then paying for school is very very difficult.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.020
 When I graduated from high school and I tried to do college at

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.850
 the same time I was working, it was very very difficult so one of

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.680
 them had to give and unfortunately I couldn't stay in school that whole

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.520
 entire time. After that then I joined the military, I did my eight

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.350
 years, and then I had a good scholarship to help me pay for the rest

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.180
 of my education. I still had to work a little bit, but that was

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.020
 more for my own personal benefit, I didn't need the money, but when

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.850
 I needed the money and I had to work that was really difficult.
