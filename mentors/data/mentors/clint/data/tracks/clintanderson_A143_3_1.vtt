The military has a really good system for acknowledging the accomplishments

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.560
 that people do. So if you go out in the middle of the ocean, and

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.910
 you come back in, that's a tour. Then you get a little ribbon right

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.260
 here. You can't see on this uniform but on other uniforms you wear,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.610
 your dress blues, your dress whites, other like nice uniforms that

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.970
 you wear, you can have like little emblems. They go three by three

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.320
 by three and you can get them for various things. If you shoot a gun

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.670
 really well, then you can get an expert ribbon. If you do something

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.030
 really really productive for the ship that you're on, then you can

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.380
 get like the Navy achievement medal let's say. Or if you go to a specific

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.730
 place in the middle, in the world, and you fight a certain war,

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.090
 then you can get another ribbon. So as you, the longer that you're

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.440
 in, you start acquiring these ribbons any you can kind of see who's

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.790
 been, number one in the longest time, and number two, who's had the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.140
 most success in their job by the amount of ribbons that they have.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.500
 You can really see lots of admirals with like really big huge stacks

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.850
 of ribbons.
