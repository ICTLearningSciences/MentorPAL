00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.850
For me, computer science is the main culture, you could say, that illuminates

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 STEM. For computer scientists, we always have these shirts that,

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.850
 you know, kind of, like, with nerdy sayings on it and if you go

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 to university, you can find all the computer science students, like,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.850
 kind of sitting at the table, talking to each other, you know, doing

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.850
 their own little gaming and you know, World of Warcraft, you know,

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 online role-playing stuff. But I think all of the, well, many of the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 other engineering fields have their own little style with them as

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.850
 well. So, the mechanic people might be, you know, working on robots

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.850
 and, you know, they're kind of like computer scientists too. For the,

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.850
 lets say, aerospace people, I'm not really familiar with them but

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 I would think that they have their own, like, kind of pilot culture

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.850
 associated with them as well, maybe more towards the NASA thing. So,

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.850
 if you've ever seen like YouTube videos of, you know, people going

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.850
 out in the space and, you know, like, the astronauts you know, kind

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.850
 of just like floating there in the air. That to me really, they're

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.850
 for me, they are the true engineers. When I think people doing the hard

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.850
 math problems, the hard, you know, science problems, I'm thinking

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.850
 of astronauts, to tell you the truth. So, just turn on anything that

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.850
 has NASA on it and that's super STEM right there.
