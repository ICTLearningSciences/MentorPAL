,,lcdr-barnhl,What is your name?,David Barnhill.
,,lcdr-barnhl,What year were you born?,1982.
,,lcdr-barnhl,How old are you now?,37.
,,lcdr-barnhl,Where did you grow up?,"Greensboro, North Carolina."
,,lcdr-barnhl,Tell me about your childhood.,"My childhood was very stable. My parents were very supportive. They were very demanding. They expected me to do well in school on. They expected me to do things outside of school. Basically, as long as I was keeping busy was something that they felt like was enriching my life. They were okay with it."
,,lcdr-barnhl,Tell me about your family growing up.,"I have one sibling. His name is Ryan. He also served in the Army. Uh, we're about we're four years apart. So he was born in 1978. I wouldn't say we're close, but we stay in touch. My dad and mom are both from North Carolina. My dad's from Eastern North Carolina, and my mom is from pretty much where I grew up in Jamestown."
,,lcdr-barnhl,"When you were a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up?","when I was a child, I wanted to be a neurosurgeon."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What kind of student were you?,It was a very diligent student. I cared a lot about doing well academically because I found a lot of validation there.
,,lcdr-barnhl,What was your home life like?,"my home life was very stable. My parents were home each night, though my dad was home later than my mom because he worked a lot. My mom stayed at home mostly, but she also was a substitute teacher. But I always had a parent available to me if I needed them. So it was. I would say it was very, as I said, stable and uncomfortable."
,,lcdr-barnhl,When did you start working with the Navy?,"My mom took me to a college fair when I was a junior in high school and we went by a booth for the United States Naval Academy. And pretty much at that. After that day, I decided that I wanted to go to the Naval Academy. I did not think much past the Naval Academy. I just thought that I wanted to go to the Naval Academy."
,,lcdr-barnhl,Are you currently serving in the military?,"I am currently serving in the Navy. My duty station is in Monterey, California, as I am a student at the Naval Postgraduate School."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What is your current position now?,"I found out about six months ago that I will be promoted to commander in September. And I am an aviator. So and I have never left the cockpit except for this tour up in Monterey, which is where I am now. So I spent about 13 years flying aircraft accumulated about 2300 flight hours flying helicopters."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What was your last operational duty assignment?,"My last operational duty was in San Diego with helicopter. See Combat Squadron 23 were hello? Were they were a helicopter squadron. But the interesting thing about H. C 23 is that they're one of the first squadrons to incorporate unmanned aerial vehicles. A CZ part of their, uh, it's part of their platform. So in addition to flying manned aircraft, we were responsible for flying unmanned aircraft while down there I was a department head, which means I was in charge of one of about four departments that make up an aviation squatter, and I was in charge of anywhere between 10 and 50 people at any one time. Basically, the department head is responsible for making sure the squadron is running, they using the knowledge that they have accumulated over their career. And typically, a department head has about 11 years experience or so they use that knowledge to kind of ensure the squadron is going in the right direction for the commanding officer. Of course, they have no no authority to command anybody in the squadron, as that is for the commanding officer and perhaps his executive officer. But if the department's aren't working well, then the squadron can have problems in a real hurry. So between the lieutenant commanders in the squadron and the non commissioned officers, that is the chief senior Chiefs and master chief's there's There's two groups of people probably most responsible for ensuring its smooth running of aviation squadron. The squadron itself was attached to the littoral combat ship, UH, which was is a small ship, and that I won't describe in too much detail. But it's relatively new small and that we would deploy with both, as I said, unmanned aircraft and manned aircraft. And typically we are. Squadron would deploy to Singapore with the littoral combat ship, which is called NLCS, and the LCS would be based out of there so they'd be in and out of Singapore with a on aviation component, every switching out every six months."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What was your first major leadership role?,"My first major leadership role was, I would say be being a detachment maintenance officer onboard a a destroyer. My first operational squadron was bigger relative to the other squadrons like it. So we had a few extra helicopters and few extra people, so we would put helicopters onboard smaller ships, vice aircraft carrier where the main body of the squadron would be. I the opportunity Thio do one of those detachments to do a detachment at least three times, but the one that was truly most rewarding, who was when I was the detachment maintenance officer? There was a lot of problem solving involved. There was a lot of interacting when the enlisted sailors and you, if you do it the right way, you find out what the enlisted sailors can teach you. And I can tell you, without a doubt that the most important person on that ship for the aviation folks was my chief of the maintenance of the maintenance folks that were working for me. What you don't truly realize when you first get in the Navy as an officer is that you don't know everything. Um, especially when it comes to things like aircraft maintenance So you need a lot of guidance. And the people that give you those guidance give you that guidance. Are the chiefs and lead petty officers that accompany you. And if you do not listen to them, you're going to have a problem. So that was That was the first major leadership opportunity I had, and probably one of the most important."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How do you spend most of your time at work?,"so the wasting your time at work is dependent on what your responsibilities are, which is probably pretty obvious. But he also depends on what point in your career you're at. So if you're a junior officer, especially in the aviation community, your main focus should be learning how to fly aircraft. And all of this is sort of related to how you should treat your career. In my opinion, uh, as a junior officer, your primary job is to learn how to fly your aircraft. Imagine in other communities that may be the same, I was told by my very first operational commanding officer, You could be one of three things. Of course, you could be more than one of three things, but these are the three things he laid out. He'd be a great aviator, which is good. You have to be a good aviator in order to progress. You could be a good ground officer, and that is important, too. But when you start looking for jobs after your first junior officer tour, no one's going to say he was a great ground officer. The third thing is, you could be a good aviator and a good ground officer, which is probably a pretty good objective because then people know that you're virtually can do different things. But you're also good in the aircraft, and being in the good in the aircraft establishes a reputation. So in a long winded sort of way, the priory of your time at work as a junior officer should be spent learning how to fly aircraft and focusing on how to do your ground job. Well, at the same time as you proceed in your career, your priorities are different. You probably spend more time behind a desk as you doing paperwork. As you get further along, however, you also start having to think about how the people working for you are doing. And that's both officer and enlisted as a junior officer. Your while you have responsibilities to enlisted people, people that are working for you, you most assuredly arm or self focused, I would say, but that becomes less and less of ah likelihood as you proceed in your career on by the time you become a department head and it doesn't matter what type of department head you are, whether you're in the service community or submarine community or aviation community. You're really thinking about how the people below you are doing both. And that has taken two ways. How, where, how well are they performing at their job and just how well they're doing as human beings, because he's poor to realize that they can be great at their job. But if they're, if they're having trouble either at home or they're getting trouble outside of work, you're gonna have to deal with that, too. So it is important to realize that at work you'll have a lot of different demands on your time, and those demands will change as you progress to your career."
,,lcdr-barnhl,Describe the work you did on a typical day.,"So when I goto, my typical day at work was different, depending on whether I was at shore or on a C tour, typically in the Navy, short tours or times of relaxation. In some ways she performed, you still have responsibilities, but that the general idea is that you worked hard at sea and now we're gonna give you a job that's not quite as demanding. And perhaps you'd go home every night, starting with at in a deployable squadron. There was always something that needed to be done, and it seemed to always need to be done in a hurry. So you get to work. I never found a reason that I absolutely had to be at work before seven, maybe 7 30 That's one of the joys of being in the aviation community. Uh, partially. I would kind of walk around, see what was see what was going on. And this is regardless of what type of role I had, uh, see what was going on. See, what if anything, needed my attention immediately upon arrival, and then I would probably sit down at my desk and check check some emails just to see who was in dire need of our service is if I did not. If I had a flight to prepare for, then I would show up pretty early. Usually if I had any. If I had a flight, I would show up at least two hours before our brief time to ensure that I, uh, was probably prepared. Not everyone felt that way, but this was my routine. Um, we would typically have a flight brief about two hours before we were going to take off, depending on the type of flight we were doing on then. Then we would do all the required pre flight routine, which was checking out their craft looking and seeing if there's any maintenance issues that we need that needed to be taken care of. Uh And then we'd start up and go fly for about three hours and then come back and often times if you had a flight. That total routine took up a good six hours your days trying to get anything done around That was kind of difficult. And like I said, it didn't matter if you were a junior officer, a department head or anything like that. That's just the nature of the aviation game, Um, and the focus of of deploy of in a deplorable squatters, always being ready to deploy or getting somebody ready to deploy or waiting for someone to get home and figuring out how you're going to incorporate those people that particular deployed detachment back into the squadron like any. Like any situation. If someone's gone for a while and they come back, there's some growing pains, and you need to figure out how to how to kind of figure that how to figure that out. So there's a lot of dealing with that. As a department head, we had to keep track of all the flight hours and all the qualifications required, because a person's qualifications would dictate how deployable they were. And the goal of every junior officer, in my opinion, is to be as deplorable as possible, because if you are not deployable, that someone else has to pick up the slack. So figuring that type of stuff out was was pretty would occupied a lot of my attention throughout a typical day. Usually I could, in a deployable squadron, I could, you know, leave by six or seven PM if I wasn't flying but a lot of times because of my level of qualification, I was flying it up until 2 a.m. Andi, come back. If I was flying till 2 a.m. That means that did not have to come into squad until the afternoon, Um, when I was on shore tour. The responsibility is just different. So I was responsible for training aviators and what we term advanced tactics. And it was not a typical short tour because there were a lot of demands on me. So when I said before about, you know is usually kind of a reprieve? Not so when I was in Fallon, Nevada, Now that and that it was because I was training people all the time. And I was either individual individual being trained or air wings or groups that were getting ready to deploy being trained and because it's pretty much a revolving door of where of people coming in and out to be trained, it required a lot of our time. Hours were erratic, and it was it was very, very challenging. So in that particular situation, I was still get there around seven or eight o'clock in the morning, and I'd be done if no one was there around five. Otherwise I could be done between seven o'clock or in the evening, too. 2 a.m. Some nights, it just it just depended. And then, at the same time Ellis had had to do flying on my short tour as well."
,,lcdr-barnhl,Describe the physical environments in which you've worked.,"so I'm a typical environment was different from day to day. If I wasn't flying, then I was typically in a hangar of some sort or the office is adjacent to a hangar. Nothing terribly abnormal are about that. If I was flying, then the cockpit was where I was working or in the hangar proper, where maintenance was being done and not specifically overseeing the maintenance. But, you know, observing, uh and this also dependent on what I was doing at the time. So on the shore to where I was in an office or in the aircraft, if I was in a deployed squadron or deployable squatter, I was I could be in an office if we weren't deployed At that time, I could have been in the cockpit or I was on a ship. Uh, and there was on several different types of ships, aircraft carriers and destroyers, mostly hand trying to describe what those types of environments were like. This is kind of difficult. It's one of those things. He you don't really appreciate it until you do it. But as far as an aircraft carriers concern, you know, it's it's an island unto itself. It's a very large island with a lot of people on it, but there's not a lot of different places to go had its own offices, but this one is a place like it's very industrial feeling. So a lot of metal exposed, you know, not a lot of creature comforts in in the way of in the way of like making things look nice. It was a warship, and that's what they what. The folks who built it expected it to look like, and that's the way it felt. One of the funny things that I always thought about was when I'd come home. And this is you don't know this until you hear someone tell you when we come home after a six month deployment or really any deployment. If you have a wife, she automatically makes you put your clothes in the washing machine because you smell terrible, largely because of just the way the ships of health. Uh, but you don't really know it at the time. But with all the metal around and the jet fuel and all the other things that are going on and perhaps 5000 closest friends, it's not terribly surprising that that that's the case"
,,lcdr-barnhl,How many hours do you work in a typical week?,"on a typical short tour. It depends on the number of hours you work. Depends on what you're doing. I I worked probably 50 hours a week on average, but I'm specifically inserting the term average there because some weeks I was low if no one was in town training, but folks were in town training required a lot of a lot of effort. 12 14 hour days sometimes. Um, and a deployable squadron, if you are not deployed again, depends on what you're doing. Uh, 10 hour days, pretty normal. Uh, if you're flying and you have a lot of qualifications and therefore a lot of demands on your life, then professional is what I mean. Then you could work 12 hour days Easy. If you are a Tse and I say this without any tongue and cheek, you're on duty 24 hours a day. As a junior officer, you you are not the demands when you're not terribly high. Um, specifically at at sea eso it Doesn't Ellen say unnecessary? Feels like you're on duty 24 hours a day. But again, as you move up in the ranks when everybody seems to need your attention, you know you'll get woken up at all hours the night for them, too, because someone needs you to do something or make a decision about something. So it's That's why I will make a blanket statement that you're on duty 24 hours a day while under while under way in the aviation community. The saving grace is that you are if you're gonna be flying, you are required to have at least eight hours available of uninterrupted sleep, which is not the same in other communities. So that did help point of it."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What kinds of decisions do you make in your career on a daily basis?,"decisions come in all flavors. They're big decisions and small decisions. Sometimes the decision comes in just deciding what needs to be on a flight schedule. Other times, it can revolve around deciding what type of rankings you're gonna put Ford for your junior officers. I mean, some of them are very innocuous on you can't believe you're making him. So you might make help. Make a decision on the who's gonna be allowed to park in the nearest parking lot, which seems ridiculous. But it is nonetheless something that has to be discussed. Other times you need to make it. You need to help make a decision on when is the best time Thio switch hangers from one type of, ah, 11 side of the base to another, which is not not a small thing to decide because it requires an entire squadron for move to one place to another. So there's not all types of decisions. There's not specifically one type that you will look. You would experience summer easy summer more difficult and require Cem Cem deliberation. Okay,"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What kinds of problems do you deal with?,"the types of problems range from personal problems of your sailors to things going wrong in the squatter, and I have experienced all types of things that you could not even think of. And if I told you all of them, you would not believe that they're necessarily true. However, there are a few good examples of what you might deal with first the personal problems, namely of your sailors. Like any group, your sailors are composed of a rep originally representative cross section of society. So as good as they are, they're going to make mistakes and do things that are questionable. Sometimes we've I've been involved with figuring out how we're going to deal with a sailor who got a d. Y with a 0.21 b a. C. Um, I've also had to deal with the problems of on aircraft. Uh, that dropped a cargo load into the ocean as they were moving it from one ship to another. We've dealt with problems with, uh, with on enlisted person who decided the best way to contain the venom of a snakebite was to shoot office thumb. Uh, just I mean, the types of problems you deal with our are myriad, and you can never guess wth e the what the extreme spectrum of those problems would be. Typically, there things, they're very tractable, and you can you can understand the problem pretty well doesn't make it easy, but it's it's something you can understand. Being in a helicopter squadron, we saw people. One of the main things we did there was move people and we had to move all kinds of people, and sometimes a lot of the time it was a last minute thing that people didn't think about. Seemingly though they may have, uh, we had to figure out how we were going to get an aircraft ready to ensure that this particular admiral could get to the ship he needed to get Thio at any one time. Sounds like an easy and an easy issue to deal with, But there are a lot of steps involved there, and if you are, if you don't anticipate this problems, there's types of things, then it's gonna be much more difficult to deal with. But that's where experience comes in. The experience you gain as a junior officer and in subsequent duty stations regards it Sure or C tour will help prepare you to deal with the problems that you can't even think of today,"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What are the major benefits of doing this kind of work?,"one of the most important things that I've learned. Ah, feature, if you if you want to call it, that is it is the exposure you get exposed to all kinds of things. You get exposed to different people from different backgrounds. He get exposed to different parts of the world. It gives you perspective. So my viewpoint on how the world may work is far different now than what it was when I first joined the military, and I give that give I give the military credit for helping me develop this. I think I'm better for it. Um, when you when you graduate from anywhere, are you you know, you are young, younger. You are very sure of what you think, what you think a lot of the time. But really, you don't have a lot of experience to back that up when the military exposes you to do these different ways of doing things with different people and seeing different countries and being on a ship for any length of time. In my particular experience, you kind of gives you a feel for for perhaps what's happening in the world and that perhaps things aren't exactly is how you exactly how you how you thought they were. And that's one of the most important parts of being in the military. And within that I think the most important part about being in the military's again exposure to the people and and it's whether it's subordinates or peers or in and superiors. Uh, you you learn the most by listening to the people around you, and that includes the people you totally disagree with and and probably never will. At least you understand their point of view. It gives you a perspective on the way they think, how they're going to do their job and how you can relate to them. Um, and people like them, and that's a very good thing."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What are the major negatives of doing this kind of work?,"the major negatives or detriments to this type of work. Some of them are fairly obvious. Time away from your family. If your operational tempo is high, you're gonna spend a lot of time away. Depending on what type of squadron you're in, you're gonna have to do a lot of training even if you're not deployed and that training and take you away. Uh, that that's that can be trying that can be trying. Um, the other side of it is is kind of more of on intellectual idea. The military is you, as you can tell us, expects conformity. A lot of ways. Thinking outside the box is not has not always sought, sought after their situations where that is. But usually conformity is what is what they want. And if you have a curiosity and questioning nature than it can be very frustrating. And you also that doesn't get you as far as you might like on a career path, I'd say eso so while it is good to question, while it's good to be curious and asked, why are we doing this? Cause that's the typical question. Uh, constantly doing that can kind of give you a sour reputation, so you just need to be careful in how you do it"
,,lcdr-barnhl,How much travel do you do in a year?,"Mount travel required for someone like me. I hate to say it, but is dependent on where your s o If you're When I was on my junior officer short tour, I did a fair amount of travel, but they're attracting folks that traveled more than me. I would say I would make three or four work trips a year in that particular capacity if I'm in an operational squadron than a lot of times, the types of training you did dictated how much you had to travel. So we and one of the squadrons I was in we did, ah, yearly trip from Atsugi, Japan, which is where we're based down to Okinawa because that's where we could do the training we needed. Then we'll stay about two or three weeks down there, uh, in in San Diego when I was a department head With that squadron, we made probably 3223 trips a year out El Centro, California, which is not far away from San Diego, but it's still 110 miles in the distance from your family did a couple times a year. And then we also had Thio travel up Thio Point, Magoo and Ventura County, California because that's where we could fly drones. Um, so all told, I'd say I made about five thio six work trips a year while in an operational squadron not being deployed. That's very dependent on the type of squad on your end. Jet Squadron travel much more for training than helicopter strong squatters."
,,lcdr-barnhl,Why do you love your job?,"a lot of times pilots love their job because of flying. That's that's first and foremost, perhaps our greatest love, sometimes even more so than their families. But the uh huh, there are a lot of downsides to that. You know, it's dangerous. It's a dangerous job. Um, and it can It can cause anxiety in some ways. I mean, you never really think you're gonna have a problem in the aircraft, But I think every aviator can point to a time where they had an issue, Uh, the other. You know, one of the best things about being in the Navy and total is exposure to the people. And if you're willing, how much you can learn broad brush, that's one of the best parts about being in the Navy for sure."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What gets romanticized about your career field that really isn't that great?,"So what you see on television, a lot of times our ships and you prod or wide screen, you know, views of ships traveling through the ocean with very ominous music being played in the background. And then you that cuts to a scene and say combat in the combat room that they have on board and people making decisions at What are we going to dio about these terrorists in this place where we're gonna fire? Are we ready to fire missiles? And it's usually not that way. Usually you're not doing much of anything. You're out to sea just in case something happens. And that could be very trying. Uh, because you trim do all this training to do this one specific thing. And that's all you do. A lot of times you can spend a whole tour and perhaps a whole career without doing the Maur glorified romanticized things missions that you think you're gonna be doing that could be somewhat difficult. A good example of this is when your station in Japan, the primary point of the aircraft carrier out there, is it simply being there. It's not that you're not gonna go attack anybody. You're not gonna You're not gonna try and find terrorists to kill, but really, is the point of the point of the carrier out there is that it's there to keep in check anybody, any, any other entities out there. That might be ad for cereal. So and you said you spent a lot of time sitting a lot of time training, a lot of time waiting for things to happen. But when things do happen, it's very quick, and then it's over. So that's one of the things against romanticize about being in the military that you don't always. You don't always understand before you get in."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What do you do now that is different from what you thought you would be doing?,"Well, I never thought that I would be studying when I'm studying at school. Uh, one of the one of my goals being in the Navy was to get a graduate degree of some sort and hopefully use it while in the Navy. But I don't know what it was gonna be. I found myself, and now I find myself in a program of study that is far different than what I was doing when I was in undergraduate studies, doing a lot of math, a lot of very a lot of computing and stuff and and different things like that. And that is not something I expected at all when I first joint and when I graduated from the Naval Naval Academy from a, uh, from a purely operational standpoint. In no way she performed it. I think I was gonna end up being qualified to fly unmanned aircraft. Um, And to be clear, there is no glory and flying unmanned aircraft in the United States Navy. But there's a future in it, I think, in the long term. So I did not think that I was gonna be involved with that. I'd always heard about it. It was always kind of like this nebulous idea that could happen sometime. But I never actually thought that I would be involved in doing that."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What are some of the common misconceptions about your field?,"One of the common misconceptions of our field is that all pilots are created equal, more specifically, that all communities are created equal. While helicopter pilots make up a significant proportion of the aviation community, they do not make up a significant proportion of aviation leadership. You can have a pretty good chance of making are being promoted to go six eventually, UM, which is pretty even. But that's because it's pretty. Is communities community specific and a lot of ways, If you want it in order to move past the captain to maybe a flag rank, you have to. You will be competing against people from other communities, and the folks that get the most traction with promotion are in the fixed wing and specifically jet communities. So the idea that everyone has an equal chance of becoming an admiral if that really does exist, I can tell you for sure that it does not"
,,lcdr-barnhl,How did your work day change over your career?,"work. They changed over the course of my career in that I ended up taking a lot of my work home with me. Um, that wasn't always the case. Uh, as a department head, you're constantly on call, even at home, because if someone gets in trouble, they call that you will. You will inevitably get a call, uh, from someone in the chain of command and let you know what has happened so that you can tell the commanding officer. So there's always a chance that this could happen. Um, that's that's probably the main difference and how things transitioned over as you stay in the Navy longer."
,,lcdr-barnhl,"Where did you have to move in your career, and how did that change things each time?","I've had to move seven times in my career. I've never been in the same place consecutively, so I first my first move was from the academy down to Pensacola, Florida, for flight training. I could have moved from there but had decided to stay, Um, in order to continue My advanced training are. And then after I finished flight training down there, I moved to San Diego, did about a year there and then from there I moved to Japan, spent three years in Japan, then moved to Fallon. Nevada spent 3.5 years there and then back to Japan for another two years, then down to San Diego after that and now I'm in Monterey. One of the things that you'll notice as you go through your career is that some people are able to stay in the same place. I never particularly wanted to do that on. I would say my wife didn't want to do that either much. Once we get used to going different places, we kind of wanted to keep doing it because it's exciting, it's it's it's fun to see new things. Now if you ask her about living in near Fallon, Nevada. She would tell you she'd hate it. She hated it, and she never wanted to go back. But I would say that despite it being a very, you know, in the middle of the desert and largely unpopulated, uh, it gives you gives you perspective on different parts of our country that you might not ever consider living in. There's a world outside, uh, the urban centers. And that was really, really a valuable experience. I don't think I would love to go back there either, but I can appreciate it for what it is. And the most important thing I could say about moving and is that we got the opportunity to go overseas. That was a significant formative experience in my life. Not everybody needs to move overseas to get that kind of perspective. Um, but it was a great experience for me, and I would recommend to any junior officer they take a tour overseas at least once in their career. It's easier to do it early on to do a late, and that's just a fact"
,,lcdr-barnhl,Where do you see yourself in 5 years? 10?,"well in five years. That's kind of curious, because in five years I will I will have the opportunity to get out of the Navy. Um, and I don't know right now, if I'm going to stay in or not, there it depends what kind of opportunities they have. They have available. Um, if I decided to stay in, then hopefully I will continue my education. Um, I would love to. I would love to get a PhD and teach at the Naval Academy, if at all possible. But if that doesn't happen, hopefully I will be able to get into some work involving what I'm learning right now, which is a lot of data science and data analysis. I don't particularly think I'll be flying anymore. Um, I think that part of my career is over. Uh, but, you know, that's just kind of natural life lifecycle of naval careers. At some point, you have to realize that you're not going to be doing what you've been doing for a while in 10 years. I'm I'm pretty sure I'll be out of the Navy and I will have moved on to a to a second career"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What makes a good leader?,"leadership requires you to listen, especially to the people. You are subordinate to you If you don't listen to them, you have no perspective on what they're exactly having to deal with. There are times where you are going to have to go with what you believe is right, despite what your subordinates think. And being able to do that is important, too, and have. But having a balance between listening to your subordinates and then being able to make a decision. Using the information you have in the information that's being given to you is essential way often. Think of leaders just operating in a vacuum, but I really think they've just surrounded themselves with people that can give them good advice, and they themselves. The leaders are very good at parsing that advice and then making the decisions necessary for whatever type of position they're in."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What are the most important first steps in a new leadership position?,"The most important first step that I can think of is to get to know your people. That goes a long way to establishing trust, asking them how they are, where they're from, what they're doing, not necessarily in detail, but just figuring out a little bit about them. Once you have some sort of personal connection to somebody, not only does it does it, you establish a report, but it personalizes the leader. You know it, it makes him It shows that they are human. And they're not just this This person that is under that is untouchable by subordinates below."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How do you set the tone as a leader? What is the right tone?,"there is a right tone, and the right tone involves respect in respect goes both ways. Discounting a subordinate's concern is not respectful, in the same token, demanding that a subordinate respect you. If for no other reason than you are in the position you're in, it's important to set that standard. You can't operate without it effectively."
,,lcdr-barnhl,"What are the most common mistakes you've seen new leaders make? (e.g., skipping steps)","the most common mistakes new leaders make. I would appropriately term that people who have come into new leadership positions because I realize is not realizing that they I need to listen to their people. Usually new leadership. New new positions don't just spontaneously arrive. There's usually some sort of infrastructure underneath that includes people have been doing that type of work for a while. As a leader, you need to leverage that experience. You don't know what you're talking about until you've leveraged that experience. If you don't do that, you're basically operating off a theory. And you have to ask yourself, Well, what if my theory is wrong about what you're supposed to be doing? The people below you, the people that end up working for you, that I've been doing that for for decent amount of time can kind of cage you and direct you and help you decide what direction you need to take this new position."
,,lcdr-barnhl,"What problems need to be rooted out early, or you'll have trouble fixing them later?","there are innumerable problems that you'll encounter. I think the way to root out problems is to establish a positive culture. Uh, if people feel like they belong in a positive way, it goes a long way to ensuring that those problems still enterprise. If you expect. If you show your subordinates that honesty is important, just for example, then they will emulate you. You'll have. You'll, of course, have some folks in your command that won't take to that type of leadership. But if you show qualities that air considered morally good, um, people will take that on board. They will know what the expectation is and that in itself can root out any problems that might exist if things were so bad that when you take a new leadership position that their specific things you need to eradicate and perhaps some draconian measures might be needed again, respect is essential. A lot of times you hear stories about in the various shops say in an aviation squadron, but it could apply to any type of unit. Uh, things were going behind going on behind closed doors that aren't necessarily on the up and up. Um, you need to figure that out and ensure that if a thing that is improper is going on and I mean inter personal relationships to professional relationships, to just doing things the right way in in the policy handed down, if things aren't happening in that in that respect, if people are cutting corners that you need to make sure people know that that will not be tolerated, and that can require some draconian measures sometimes."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How much leadership should you take charge of versus letting your senior petty officer lead?,"the junior officer is an interesting animal, especially eight years. They're way over, confident. All of us are way overconfident, and probably it's because we have a romanticized view of flying aircraft. The junior officer is one of the most ubiquitous officers in any type of unit, so they're going to be everywhere all the time. As faras delegation is concerned, the junior officer should probably need a tow. Learn to delegate first, and that usually comes from talking with their non commissioned officer that may be working with them. Contrary to popular belief, the a mentor for an officer can often be a non commissioned officer. And in some ways, that's more appropriate because that's who you're really gonna learn from. They will show you how to delegate. And then as you learn and glean information from them, you can kind of make your own decisions on how much you should insert yourself in certain situations and and weirdo and whereto generally back off and just let things run themselves. Uh, most importantly, I think it's just you need to show that your present you need to know your people. You need to know they need to know you're around, but you also need to stay out of the way so you don't prevent them from doing what they're really good at."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How do I balance being close with my team versus fraternizing?,"they're different methodologies to avoid Fran ization. Well, we'll say about the aviation community is that when you're flying in an aircraft, in my case, when you're flying with three other people, you have to have a good report with one another. So a lot of times it might be a touch more personal in some respects than in other communities. Don't get me wrong. The differentiation between officer and Enlisted exists and is should be apparent. But it's just a little bit different because if you have a problem in an aircraft, if one person has a problem in the aircraft you all have a problem in the aircraft. You're all in it together, right? And that requires a certain level of, of, of respect and understanding that, you know, despite the rank differences, you're all people, and you're all you gotta y'all. You all have to come together to make the mission work. But as faras delineating that you gotta rely heavily on your again on your committee. Your non commissioned officers, those non commissioned officers have a significant amount of experience that they've seen and they can help you draw the line of what isn't isn't okay you need the leverage that experience professionally, but he also need to make it clear that you are the officer and the superior without doing it disrespectfully."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How have your priorities changed as your career progresses?,"probably is definitely shift as you move through your career. And he it is a balance you learn to balance is really what it comes down to in your professional life. Things change and your personal life things change. You get married, you have kids. Um, professionally, you become responsible for more and more things or people. Uh, so your priority becomes less about you and Maura about the people that are working for you or the people that you associate yourself with and you, and it's not just simply taking care of everybody, but at the same time, you need to be able to offer an appropriate work life balance. Because if you're not doing okay, if you're if you're not prioritizing yourself in some way, shape or form, you're it's gonna be detrimental to everybody that's working for you or as well as everybody that's associated with you personally that rely on you. Okay, so, uh, priorities definitely shift, um, into to summarize. Specifically, they shift in a way that you become more focused on the people that work for you as opposed to yourself. But then you also have to keep in mind that priority of yourself so that you don't get so run down that you can't effectively lead your subordinates"
,,lcdr-barnhl,Can a leader really change a team? And what does that require?,"changes, usually a long process. A leader can potentially changes team. But one of the difficulties specifically about being in the military is that you don't have a lot of time to make change in any particular unit you're in. It's almost as if you're not. If you're not hitting the ground running as soon as you get to a unit, if you intend to make change, it can be very difficult to achieve that and any change you might have affected. We usually come after gone so you don't even see. You don't necessarily even see the rewards of that. If it does come about 18 with that said, a team can change. What's required is, I have to say, very dependent on the personalities you're working with. Some people are receptive to the change. Other people don't don't don't receive it too well. People like the way things were working, and they do not appreciate that nuts and bolts of it, though, if you want something to change, he demanded to change and what it can come down to is the subordinates following the orders that you put out there. If you establish what the priorities are, then they are typically obligated to follow them. Now your subordinates perhaps can can, you know, go around what you want, and there are various ways to do that. But it helps if you kind of explain why you're doing what you're doing. And usually if you're talking to your senior enlisted leadership and explain why you want things to change, that itself can go a long way to affecting change within the unit. But that's contingent upon your senior enlisted leadership being ready to listen to you."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How has your view of this line of work changed over time?,"a view of what I've been doing has certainly changed. I would say that I was very naive and myopic and how I viewed what I thought I was gonna be doing when I first was commissioned. But as the realities became more and more parents, I would say, my son I was a bit more became a bit more cynical than I originally was, which is not necessarily a positive thing. But at the same time, when you see the reality of what you're you're doing it, it can help you prioritize the things that the matter. Okay, um well, no, not all going to take off from aircraft carriers and shoot down makes. That's just not reality. What we are going to do is spend a lot of time training for something that we don't end up doing. Um, so, like any job, while this is definitely more exciting than most, that is for sure, you kind of end up in a routine of ensuring the normal things get done, you know, making sure people get trained, making sure that you're you're you're passing muster on inspections and things like that. Um, and it becomes kind. It does become kind of run of the mill even though you're flying a $30 million machine and in some respects, $100 million machines. So, uh, even doing something exciting like that, you can kind of find yourself getting into a routine and just realizing that this is this is at its very core, a job doesn't mean it. It's not a noble job, but it is still kind of a job, and that's one of the things that have come to terms with over my time in the Navy."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What command practice priorities would you recommend for a person entering this field?,"so enjoying the enjoying The navy? Um, you don't know what you don't know. Um, which is understandable. But if you boil it down to a priority that you would like to see in a command and I translate command into any entity that you're gonna work in while you're in the Navy and you could take that it's d down to the very aircraft you're going to command because there is a commander of an era of each aircraft, huh? Is number one for first and foremost respect going both ways. Now, some of you might end up being in a single seat aircraft. So you know the maid. Perhaps that's not the best example. But I flew an aircraft that had up thio, typically five people that I was responsible for. There have. You have to show respect for the people that are below you, and they and you have to demand the respect coming back the other way. That is absolutely essential to ineffective, uh, working environment, whether you're talking about being on the ground or in the air, and I think that's something you could just generally take with you in any facet of life if You know, if people are being respectful, one other one another than there's gonna be friction and difficulty and you could circumvent that very easily by just establishing that from the get go. The way you're gonna operate is gonna be based on respect. You can have differences, but as long as you can respect each other in your differences, that's that goes a long way. Might sound a little bit naive, but if you establish that early, that will take you for"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What skills do you wish you had mastered before entering your profession?,"I don't particularly think there any riel skills that I needed. Um, entering the navy. It was nice to have the Naval Academy is a kind of indoctrination, too. The navy. He's kind of see where you're as a as a midshipman. It's kind of a weird dichotomy in that you're coddled, but then you're not, You know, your butt that you're yelled at you. They wanna treat you with kid gloves and then you But then at the same time, they're gonna kind of throw you into the fire. Says there's that wasn't self on. Okay, thing to have happen. Um, but a lot of what you learn about being in the Navy occurs while you're doing it. I mean, if there was an example of on the job training being in the military, is it? You could say that I wish I had learned to fly before I was in the Navy. But anybody can see this year volume of people that go through the aviation training pipeline shows that that is not necessary. You don't have to major anything specific in order to be an aviator. Same thing goes for being a surface warfare officer. Now, if submarines might be somewhat different. But you know, there's nothing specific that you have to do that will automatically determine you have a better time in the Navy than another. Um, one thing I will say. It's not specifically a skill. Uh, is that it really helps if you are a reader, um, and a writer, for that matter. Uh, if you're willing to sit down and read and that that that and you start that early, then that automatically gives you different perspectives again. You don't agree with the perspective, but it still gives you a different perspective. And I think the more you see people read, uh, the more effective they can be in how the on how they lead people, because it also shows a willingness to learn. Now, as far as writing is concerned, I learned to write at the Naval Academy pretty effectively, and I wouldn't say that that I would be the type of writer that would write any particular anything professionally at this particular moment, still need work on it, but conveying of ideas, you're always gonna have to answer to somebody, and a lot of times the way you're gonna have to answer questions is via written communication, being able to effectively, efficiently, cogently, concisely right and those ideas is essential. So when he can't write just sounds sounds like they have not been educated. Uh, appropriately, um, there's a level of professionalism that comes with that that people don't give enough weight to."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What is one question you wished you asked earlier?,"I don't think there's exactly one question that I would ask one of my issues with the initial training I received in the Naval Academy in the indoctrination they provided was was that it was the way they presented being in the Navy to me after looking back, it's not exactly reality. You don't truly understand. It's like having Children. You don't really know what it's like until you actually do it. And then you realized both the joys and the difficulties that our associate with, but no one really tells you about. So there are so many questions you could ask to try and fill the void of. You don't know what you don't know, but you know, that would take too much time. And there's not really I can't There's not really any specific thing that I thought I was just missing out on. I think one. I think one of the things one of the things that I wish I could have been conveyed is that it's okay not to know everything. That's what the people working for you or for now, of course, that's required. That requires you to be able to listen and ask the appropriate questions. But you don't have to know everything. And in some respects I think that that isn't it's appropriate. It's appropriate important to show that you don't know everything, because that shows that you're willing to rely on other people to help you. And there's nothing wrong with that. That's to me. That's a strength. But that wasn't that wasn't something that was typically conveyed as a leader. When you're young 22 in my case, you first become commissioned. You assume Oh my gosh, How am I going to I need to know everything. I can't show that I don't. But I can tell you that if you have somebody that's working for you who has had 10 years of experience, maybe even five, they will make it very clear to you that you don't know what you're talking about and that you need to listen to them. Uh, hopefully in a respectful way. But it will become very clear very quickly"
,,lcdr-barnhl,"As a leader, how much more does a JO know about the overall goals of the assigned work?","So Joo is that the bottom of the totem pole when it comes to the officer corps? Interestingly enough, without a strong junior officer corps, you will have a problem in any command you're in. But that doesn't mean the junior officers have the full perspective on why we're doing what we're doing headed any one particular time. A good example of this is the deployments of the aircraft carrier out in Japan. That's where I was. When you think about flying or deploying in general, do you think about doing things and you don't? And when you first get in the Navy as a junior officer, you're thinking probably along those same lines, very romanticized view of what you're going to be doing in the Navy. But then taking the Jap, the carrier that's based in Japan, as an example. When they deploy, they typically do the exact same things every year, specific locations and the point of them being there is just to be there, to dissuade any of any potential adversaries, from doing anything that leads to the folks on that carrier, doing things that air very run of the mill that could be very routine and in a very, very boring. The strategic importance of the carrier is perhaps not seen by the junior officer, just like it's probably not seen by the enlisted. Now it can be gleaned, and I think he'd be gleaned fairly easily by both of those cruise. But as a general rule, that junior officer doesn't have much more inside a STO. What's exactly happening, as has perhaps here listed on your listed court would either."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What was the most difficult part of your training?,"the most difficult part of my training. I would say there was a specific thing that was difficult. I would say that my mindset, Um, I'm the type of person that wants to to do well, like automatically. And, you know, they're gonna be times and your training that you're not going to do. Well, you're gonna have bad days, and perhaps you might have a couple bad days in a row accepting that as a normal part of the way things work is important. Realizing that that's gonna happen is important. You're going to fail, and that's okay. Realizing it's okay. It's probably most difficult part for me. I did not have a ton of failures when I was going through my training, but there were some and it was very impactful. So that was one of the was one of things. I had to learn that it's okay to fail, that you're going to fail, but you need to figure out how to move past it."
,,lcdr-barnhl,Is it normal to have conflicts in the first few days in a new unit?,"conflicts is normal in a new unit. If you're new to that, you know, I should say there's an adage you need to shut up for the 1st 6 months. Shut up and listen. If you're causing conflict has directly related to you, then you need to take a better look at yourself because you don't you really don't know what's going on until you've observed what's happening in that unit for a period of time. They say six months. But it could just as well be three months if you come in there. If you come into a new unit and start trying to change things automatically specifically as a junior officer, that can grow people the wrong way. So really, I would say in a roundabout way, is that if you go to a new unit to avoid the conflict, start from the positions, you know, I'm gonna listen first, and once I get an idea of how things work, then I'm going to try and serve myself"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What must a JO do to be able to know they have led honorably?,"honorable service is comes in a variety of different forms, I'd say, kind of like the judicial system. The initial idea is that you're going to serve honorably. People do that in different ways. You know, the default is that you're going to serve in your career and you're going to get out whenever you get out where there's 20 years or five years and you're going to get an honorable that a non arable discharge, that's that's the expectation. If you want to go further in that and think about what's what constitutes serving honorably, I think that is almost an unanswerable question. Other than saying, How did you treat the people around you? You know, our were the people you worked with, whether their peers, superiors or subordinates. I mean, did they leave you feeling as though they had a bad taste in their mouth? Did you help them? Did you think about ways to make their lives better? Did you know when it was appropriate to discipline them? You know, holding the standard with regard to respect and really anything is probably the most honorable thing you can do when that slips, you know, that's when you start getting into a nebulous world that is is not taken leads us, um, difficult situations. There are so many examples of specifically commanding officers, but it is not limited to them. I have done things that you can't believe they've done. You know, the that person was selected to be a leader, a very small group of people, relatively speaking, And then they've done. They've decided they have made decisions and choices, or they have kept things hidden that they shouldn't have, and you would definitely call them that, in a sense, desirable. But it's likely because they made choices early on. That kind of skirted the rules. That's an opinion. But I think that to be true, if you're willing to skirt, skirt the rules on small things, it doesn't automatically mean you're going to skirt the rules on big things. But it makes it maybe perhaps more likely, you're more comfortable with it. So simply put, serving honorably is maintaining a standard which can be very boring. But that's really how I would define it."
,,lcdr-barnhl,"What are some good resources to look at before starting (books, videos, classes)?","there are a number of resource is that I think I could list off. I'll name just a couple now. Wide for War is a book by Peter Singer. It kind of gives you an idea of the technology aspect of the military and where things are likely going to be going. Um, and that's especially important the aviation community, because we think of aviation's like the persons in a cockpit flying. But things were moving away from that, albeit slowly. Pretty soon, we're gonna have you're gonna have drones flying off carriers that will be responsible for refueling jet aircraft. And that's what we've already seen that with the MQ 25 stingray I flew drones and drones fly off ships routinely. Now, though, you know it's still slowly developing. So the romanticized view of being an aviator is certainly changing. Another good book that I have really liked and then offered a lot of perspective that's not specific specific towards the military is called Thinking Fast and slow by Daniel Kahneman. It's kind of a dense read, but it is very good. It gives you an idea of how people think, uh, why they think the way they do and essentially just breaks down that we'll have intuition and most the time. It's wrong, which is somewhat disconcerting in some respects. But it allows you to question yourself. There's nothing wrong with, and it's nothing wrong with question yourself may allow. It kind of gives you an idea of Maybe I should think a little harder. Why, this is the way it is. I always thought of it is it helped me not come to rash judgments as we're all want to do. In my opinion, I also like various documentaries. One of my favorites is fairly recent Ken Burns. Vietnam War is a tremendous documentary, like any of his other work, but it gives you real perspective on things that were going on during that period and perhaps helps you realize that while there was a lot of animosity at that time, and, you know, we think we've learned from that time perhaps things you know. Some things are still still suspect, and we should be watching out for those things. So those were just three resource is that of a ton that I could think of regards of what I say read, read everything you get hands on, and that will go a long way to helping you"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What is it critical to review when you start in a new command?,"when you get to a new command. I mean, the first thing you want to dio is get well acquainted with her policies. They're going to affect you and the people that are gonna work for you. That goes a long way to maintaining standards which are central to efficient running of any command. Um, that's where that's where I would start And then after that, You know, if you're an aviator, your priority is to greet about their craft are gonna fly, learn about it, learn everything you can about it. Because if you don't, if you don't take that property, you're gonna have issues later on."
,,lcdr-barnhl,Describe your ideal team.,"my ideal team encompasses experience. Um, with with a fair amount of highly skilled individuals, they can. They can take orders depending on, regardless of the size of the team. I will need someone who is directly under me. That is, has a good report with the air with their subordinates. Has a lot of experience on dealing with this type of thing, and the folks under that are underneath them wood in the event. This is the way it is set up. Folks that have are highly skilled and experienced in their specific in the specific tasks they will be asked to accomplish."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What things do you always make sure to lead by example on?,"the easiest thing. The easiest way to lead by example. It is being respectful and the same token, demanding respect. If people see you being respectful and required respect be given to you, that's the way we're gonna lead. That's usually what ends up happening and in the military people we're going to move up in the different types of leadership and responsibility rolls it will have, and they're gonna look back in the ways that they we're lead. That's certainly what I did."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What are some tips to earn the trust of my team?,"junior officers come into the military regards of service, basically knowing nothing the way they earn respect is by willing to learn from those that are below them because they often have more experience and more skill than that particular junior officer. An aviation. The junior officer comes into an operational squadron knowing how to fly an aircraft basic barely. But that's all they know how to do. The learning really starts starts there, and it usually starts with the people that are working immediately with them."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How do you connect more deeply with your team members?,"the way I've connected with various teams and team members that I've had is basically just being open to them, listening to them. If you're the leader, though, you need to set expectation to be clear about what those expectations are. And if they're somewhat controversial, you need to be clear on why those expectations are the way they are. You have to realize that the connection you're establishing is not necessarily appeared, appear. Relationship. It's a superior to subordinate relationship. Most of the time. The folks that work for you understand they're the subordinate and you're the superior. So that's kind of built into the into the relationship itself you need. But you still need to make sure that that is what you what you expect now within that as a leader. As I said before, you need to be willing to listen. Listen to their ideas, listen their frustrations. If you're willing to listen, that goes a long way into establishing a good report in connection with the folks that work with you and for you"
,,lcdr-barnhl,"How do I build trust between different team members? (e.g., new ones, ones with bad interactions)","I think this is true for any officer. When when leading a team, the first thing you do is embrace them. Embrace the new team member. Be clear about what your expectations are of them. It may not be specific to their individual role, but what the with the intent of the team is, if you embrace them, your subordinates will oftentimes follow suit."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What are good strategies to have the right kind of presence with my team?,"the first thing you can d'oh! To establish the right type of presence with the team is too set. Your expectations in the first expectation you should have is one of respect. You respect them and they respect you, and that's the way it's going to be."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How do you and your work colleagues socialize outside of work?,"one of the best things about being in aviation specifically and in the Navy as a whole is the camaraderie that you establish with each other. I think it's fairly unique to any to this type of organization. There aren't that many other organizations where you're going to do something you're gonna You could be in harm's way with this, these other people and, uh, you know you need to have a personal connection with them as well as professional. So I think it is appropriate both with peers and with subordinates to no socially gather to have frank conversations about personal lives. That way you get to know each other. You know where people can't come from. You know what people are thinking about and you can figure out ways to try and help him out. Um, the. Unlike other other organizations, I think the line between personal and professional is more blurry in the military, whether it should be or not. But I think it's intentionally blurry as very well met, perhaps should be. Obviously, there's some things you need to be careful of. There is a line, but I don't think the line is well established kind of, like one of those things, you know when you see it. So what you need to do is ensure that you never see it. Nothing could be construed is overly overly personal. There is a line between you and your subordinates. You need to be clear. Well, what that, Linus, but is that it doesn't need to be so stark and, uh, and and and clear for that to be the case, you can also rely on your non commissioned officers to help you establish that one."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How should your relationship be with your subordinates? (close vs. far),"your relationship with your subordinates should be respectful, but you need to be approachable. If they have a problem, you need to be available. That's part of the nature of being in the military, and it's one of the unique things about being in the military. Not only are you concerned about the professional aspects of someone's life, you're you need to be concerned about the personal side of, uh, your subordinates life. If they have trouble, that means you're gonna They're gonna have trouble If they have trouble at home. That means they're probably have trouble work. They're very dealing with things outside of work. Then you know they can't be there to do their job. It sounds it sounds very. Perhaps, you know, non altruistic Thio. Reach out to somebody and try and help them just because you want them built a work. But it doesn't really come across that way. I mean, naturally, I think humans care about other humans just because, and that's the type of thing you need to inculcated in your in your command or just leadership position. So you need to be approachable. You need to show that you care about your subordinates But you also need to show that there's going to be disciplined in your unit and there are various ways that you could do that."
,,lcdr-barnhl,"How do I help my team prepare for a tough mission? (e.g., inspection, long mission)","you prepare for significant operational events by being prepared early, and that could mean just operating the way you would want the inspectors to see on a daily basis. Now that's a hard thing to do, because usually when you're being inspected or you're getting ready for deployment, especially the training involved with getting ready for deployment, the inspectors and trainers may be trying to nit pick the small things that they've got to find something wrong. Um, so that's kind of different, kind of kind of difficult. But, you know, if you if you set a standard that's based off of like how you want to deploy, how you want, how you want other people to see you, how you would want a trainer to see your inspector to see you. If that's just the way you operate, that can go a long way and make getting prepared for these events much, much simpler. That's never going to be easy. There's always gonna be something, but you know, that's 11 thing you could do"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What kinds of people will I work with? Personalities,"Now you're gonna work with all kinds of people, people that you disagree with, people that you really like, people that you don't like. But it turns out you're still gonna have to work with. You have to figure a way around that, Uh, I've never been in a situation where there was someone that just, absolutely could not work with. If you find yourself in that situation part of it's probably you remember that no matter how long you are in a place, you're eventually gonna leave as probably going to be on the order of two years or three years and that person or that person is gonna leave. So just being able to deal with that person free for that period of time, that might be your best strategy. I do not want you to take that to mean that if this if, if you're working with a difficult person that is denigrating that is disrespectful or just doing things that are just plain wrong that is different than someone who is just holds a totally different but perhaps equally valid perspective on and you argue about that. Those are two separate things"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What kinds of people respond better to certain leadership strategies?,"Not every leadership strategy is appropriate for every subordinate. Some subordinates Onley react to draconian measures. Other subordinates react to the very fact that they could get in trouble. They don't need the motivation Thio to do the right thing. Um, I had a sailor that was working for me. Haven't be a warm a young woman. And she was She had a domestic violence and I don't think they turned it like that. As in she I had a physical altercation with her significant other in which she beat him up. Um, this was a second. This was the second of a couple events, and she was told that if anything else happened, her command would not stick up for her and would not. I intend to keep her in the military. She would be separated. Well, she turned it around. She ended up becoming one of the best sailors that I worked with. Uh, I think one of the important things about discipline and establishing standards and using your very using your leadership is a mechanism for for how to do things is that we're all subject to failure. We all have problems. If you haven't had a problem yet. Well, you just need to wait, because you will. And you're going to need the mercy of your leader. Help you keep going. And that, I think, is true across the board."
,,lcdr-barnhl,When is it a good idea to share personal stories or emotions with members of your team?,"emotions are a tricky thing in leadership positions. Emotions showing emotion and distaste, for instance, are not good when you're being asked to do something hard or difficult that no one's gonna like. You really just have to toe the line. Um, whether you believe in it or not, If you need to let off steam and talk about how much you don't like what you're doing, you need to find a pier or maybe even a superior to talk to about it. But showing that to your subordinates in that situation is not. I would not advise that, however, emotion is a good thing when we're talking about, uh, maybe not day to day situations. But when something good happens, being happy for someone is human. That's appropriate. Being angry for someone because something bad happened. Them is also human. It shows support. It makes you relatable. Uh, stories also help very much with making you relatable. You talk to any person has been in the military for longer than 10 years, maybe in five years, and they will have accumulated a vast cache of stories that they will willingly tell you that will that may or may not have a point, but at least it gives you a perspective on what that person went through on something that you might be able to use in your own and that support it may be able to use in how they're going to operate in the military. I routinely rely on stories, Thio explain myself when I'm talking to us and talking to a subordinate. I think one reason for that is when you're talking about you know how things theoretically should work and the ethereal you can always come up. A person can always come up with a reason why that may not be the case. But if you tell a story that is mostly grounded in fact, uh, it's hard to dispute that. And if you have an experience that someone can take with them and think about, then that that has much more of an impact than just saying we should do something because it is the way it is. If you can show why that goes a long way"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What counseling skills are important?,"counseling is about feedback giving feedback. Too many times I've been in a finished report debriefing the The outcome was You're doing a good job. Keep up the good work and that's great. I like doing a good job and I will continue to keep doing the work. But really, what they need to know is where I can get better. I don't care how good I am, how good a person is. There's always somewhere where they can prove if you're not as a leader, if you're not giving people feedback, you're doing them a disservice you're not preparing them for later on. In my opinion, now they will. Being is the simple act of being able to receive critique constructively, of course, and feedback is a skill in itself. You have You have to teach people how to do that. If you're not giving feedback as a leader, you're not helping your people out"
,,lcdr-barnhl,How do I push my team to meet the standards? (if they are having trouble meeting them),"Getting your team to meet standards is is difficult. If they're not meeting them, sometimes you have to take very extreme measures to make that happen. They are not popular. Uh, you know, you could have inspections every week. Uh, if if you need to meet a certain goal, But you could you extend working hours as long as it's reasonable to ensure that things were getting done and there are several different ways to make that happen. But you also need to show that you have an interest in them doing well not only because it matters for you, but, you know, as a point of pride for them. Uh, there's no one surefire way to ensure that you're gonna pass t to meet standards. But you know that that's a small way that you can do it. You could do it"
,,lcdr-barnhl,How should you reward your sailors for good performance?,"the easiest and most effective way to reward a sailor is being very vocal in public about the good job they've done, uh, part of it. It's easy to say, Well, that's their job, and that's what they're supposed to do. But, you know, being saying, telling someone they did a good job in front of everybody go. It goes a long way. I think it makes you mean I'm just talking about my own personal experience. If someone said I did a good job then and then you feel good. It makes me gives, gives a person a steak and what and what they are and what you're doing. Uh, the Navy, of course, and all military branches have their own ways of rewarding people with promotions and awards and all these other things. And you should you should work hard to make that a normal part of the professional environment. That's not hard to dio. Any good commanding officer and leader should be pushing to reward their people with the appropriate naval commendations or what military commendations as it were. Um, but I think sometimes just the positive words can mean mortar folks than putting a ribbon on a chest. They go. The ribbon on the chest puts put, helps people promote and keep going in their career path. But that doesn't automatically mean it shows what somebody thinks of them. If if I come to you and say you did a very good job, thank you for all the work you've done that can go further than just a formal ceremony, said doing something somewhere."
,,lcdr-barnhl,"What traits and experience, do you look for when interviewing new team members?","one of the attributes that I look for in somebody that might be working for me or even if they're one of my peers, how were they gonna anticipate problems? Uh, I've worked with plenty of people that will see the problem in front of them, deal with it and deal with it effectively, but failed to see what the second and third order effects are gonna be of this problem are even dealing with this problem. How does it? Because sometimes the way you deal with the problem changes the way you're gonna end up, uh, you're gonna end up operating in some respect. Uh, strangely enough, I've it seems like my experience with women in the military is that they're better at anticipating problems than men. But they might also be a function of the fact that you're generally with a lot more men in the military and those s o. You notice those things, perhaps about one and more. Um, I always valued a subordinate more when they were thinking ahead at what could happen with the current problems that we were dealing with"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What should your relationship be with your reporting seniors?,"your relationship with your reporting. Seniors needs to be professional, but in the same time, somewhat personal. Uh, you need to be ready to tell them that you disagree with them. That doesn't mean they're gonna take your side or agree with you, but they need to know that perspective. It's the same reason why you need to have an open relationship with your subordinates. What? Now? You know, you might need to respect the fact that your superior is not gonna listen to what you had to say. But you need to be willing to do it. You need to be willing to say that. You disagree, Even if you know that they aren't gonna take it. That is easier, more easily said than done. Um, but that is it is an important point. We need to as leaders, we should be surrounding ourselves with people that offer us perspective that offer us advice. And sometimes that advice is much different than what we think should happen"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What would you advise a person in this field to get to know their bosses?,"in the Navy had any military service. Formally, it's, isn't it? It's the responsibility of these Senior officer two get to know their subordinates. But when the opportunity arises for that to happen, however, the senior officer facilitates that the junior officer, orgy or subordinate needs to take part. It doesn't need to be. It doesn't need to be for a lengthy period of time. But doing that can can establish a personal report with the commanding officer and is as good as you are professionally. There is a personal aspect. All thi this. You need to realize that even in your personal relationship with your with your senior officer, they are evaluating you. It's not necessarily a bad away, and they might be doing it unconsciously. But they'll remember the things you say that how you acted, what you did. So if you go out with them and you end up having way too much to drink, they will not forget that even though it might have been a one time thing, Uh, so basically, in on the flip side of that while it is on the on the senior officers is a senior officer's responsibility to get Thio facilitate getting to know their subordinates. I don't think there's anything wrong with periodically seeing if your senior officer wants to go get some lunch or something like that, Uh, perhaps in a group setting or something like that. So if a bunch of junior officers going out and you say, Hey, let's invite our department head that may be fairly appropriate. Also, I have been fortunate enough to be in several places where there are officers, clubs, and you talking with your bosses in the Officers club is usually a has usually been on effective way to get to know them. Um, what? Whatever, you know, whatever establishment allows that it would be similar appropriate."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How do you handle supervisors who were unable or unwilling to give you feedback?,"it's hard to get feedback from from senior officers. Sometimes, um, the sometimes It's not in the senior officers nature to give feedback. Sometimes they want to keep their cards close so that they said that the subordinate doesn't know what what they're doing. I think there's an intrinsic fear that if a subordinate is given is told very directly how they're doing, they will. They will failed to perform. But really, I think comes down how this criticism or feedback is presented. We all learn methods to do this, and the most basic one that I know of is say, you're doing really well at this. You need to work on this, but you're also doing really well at this, so you be flush with praise while also giving critique on where someone could do better. But as this from a subordinate standpoint, you have to demand feedback. You have to you have to let in a respectful way. You have to know, or you have to let your son you know that you want feedback. It's important to you. It's it's how you grow. In my last command, I received several fitness reports that said You're doing a great job. And the fertile debrief was similar in a statement. I had to ask them directly to give me to tell me where I can improve to help help the command do better. And one time there was not. I thought that was supremely unhelpful. Uh, I specifically brought this up not that particular time, but, uh, to one of my future bosses and explaining that we need feedback. We need to know what's wrong with how we can do better. And it did get better with the with the next commanding officer, but showing your commanding officer or your boss, whoever it is that you're interested in feedback that you want to know how you can get better, that you're not afraid of what they might say about you, you know, shows strength. But that's important. You have to be clear about that. That's what you want."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What encourages accountability in a team?,"well. The first obvious answer that shows that shows encourages accountability is that there are consequences that if you're if you're not doing what you're supposed to, d'oh! And these can be, these consequences could be immediate or you know they could be can manifest manifest himself later. Um, so that's that's very basic. But another thing that can facilitate accountability indirectly is that even if you don't do something right or if you do something so par, knowing that you can do better later and it's okay, there's no that that while you don't want to do poorly, there's still a chance to make up for what you make up for what you did, um, and that I think can help lead someone. Two. You're just establish accountability in the cells from the get go. It makes them more comfortable. It doesn't mean that they're going to like Okay, well, if I didn't, I don't do well this time. There's always next time. I don't think people naturally see it like that. Uh, I think they know that there's understanding in their superior, um, that they expect them to do well. But But there's not this idea that there's not a feeling that perfection is expected or achievable by there by their superior officer"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What are ways you can identify the strengths and limitations for each member of your team?,"one of the normal ways we we try and identify strengths and weaknesses of of a group is through counseling, and oftentimes it comes through introspection of the individual person. So in counseling will often ask the person to provide three things they're good at and three things that they could do better. And this can lead to some discussions about, uh, you know what they can work on and what they on and how they can make these to make these things happen. So that's that's that's one idea that you may be able to use."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What is the best way to develop ones' skills in working in and with teams?,"you become a better team member by continually being part of a team not being afraid to be a part of a team and not seeing the team as a group of individuals, and you're all working towards the same goal. Oftentimes, one of one of the problems that I always had was like, you know, I didn't get in a group, that we were supposed to be working together, and I feel the need to potentially established own, you know, my my own. Ah, uh, perhaps not dominance. But you know, my position of authority amongst that group, whether they were appears their subordinates, um, is important to realize that that's not necessary. You know, your your strengths will come out in the wash. Yeah, as you as you guys start getting through, whatever task you're trying to accomplish, people will notice your strengths. You need to be assertive and what you can and can't do. But there doesn't need to be a situation where you're simply demanding that you be in charge of any one particular thing because you think you're the best at it is that very well may not be the case"
,,lcdr-barnhl,How is it different to manage military people vs. civilians in the military?,"I have never had to specifically be in charge of civilians, but I've had to have encountered them. Um, and, you know, day to day experience, You have to realize that military members have various standards that they have to hear to. And because you are a military member, you have to adhere to them, too. So you know them like you know what the standards are. In some cases, you're not sure what the standards are for the civilian employees. The one thing I keep coming back to regards of who you're working with are working for is the idea of respect. If you're respectful of somebody and a lot of times, I'll go out of the way their way to help you, whether they're military or civilian."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What is the difference between working in the public vs private sectors?,"I have never worked in the private sector, but I can into it a couple things, the camaraderie that comes with being in the military. And while it said probably, Well, we might be talking about the public sector more broadly, my experiences in the military. So that's what I'm gonna lean on. You build a lot of camaraderie in the military, and that may occur in the private sector, but I think it's less likely to happen. Uh, you don't necessarily. I mean, some of the greatest friendships I have I developed over the years or with people that I worked with and Japan especially, and the people you work with are the people you play with two s o. So, you know, and that's that's kind of unique. Um, I'm not sure that's the case in the private, the private sector. You might have friends that you work with, Uh, but you don't have the same camaraderie and report you don't. You might not have the same sense of purpose. You saw purpose. Perhaps not the same sense of purpose that you develop. Uh, I think I think one of the one of the ideas affecting is affecting This is the is the expected conformity that comes with being in the military. No, You're expected to think a lot of the same things. Um, and you know that I think that might go a long way to explaining some of this some of this camaraderie."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What makes the Navy different than other branches of the military?,"the Navy is different from the other branches. I guess you could kind of think of it. Maybe is more of a strategic service. You know, we operate with, with the exception of special warfare, um, and things and communities like explosive ordnance disposal. Usually you're talking about warships floating around with compliments of large weapons, as opposed to, say, the Army, which the the entity that's operating might be a, uh, squad company platoon battalion of people, Um that can be used at different variations on maybe a tactical level. While while the Navy still does operates on the tactical level with the nature of patrolling the world's oceans, it becomes very strategic very quickly. That overall purpose of patrolling the sea lanes lends itself to be more be more strategic in general."
,,lcdr-barnhl,Describe an experience that illuminates (Navy) culture.,"There are a number of experiences that I've had that that Yeah, illuminates Navy culture, huh? And they're ever present. You know, it's not just one thing that occurred. I can think back Thio when I was a junior officer, my first command and we every time someone would leave, we would have what's called a hail on bail. So if new people were coming in way, say we'd hail them say, Well, essentially welcome, make fun of them a little. And then the folks for the folks that were leaving, we'd make a big deal of sending them off. It wasn't our particular method of doing it wasn't like this. This formal thing, we were right essentially a we call scroll, which is basically we'd write about the person experience in a very humorous way. At least we try to make it as humorous as possible, and along the way, weed we allow a fair amount of collateral damage of other people in the squadron usually was a way to make fun of people, but also at the same time show appreciation for what a person has done, Uh, that that type of thing. I'm not so sure that would particularly go very well and in civilian life or in a private sector. But because of the the shared experience aspect of the military, that does seem to go a long way. Um, it makes people feel good, and it shows an appreciation in a way that, you know, some folks just don't some folks in the private sector and just might not understand we did. We did a number of those when I was. Since I've been in my community, The underlying thing about it is that you're always showing appreciation for the people you work with. You appreciate the hard work they put in. You appreciate the time you spent with him whether it was by counsel or just by their very, very their skill set. Um, I thought that was always very important, and and incidentally, it's something that I think is kind of gone by the wayside, as times have changed in perspective has changed"
,,lcdr-barnhl,How do you help morale?,"one way you could help morale when things kind of taking term from the worst is just is being the the kind of stoic, the stoic leader that made that calls for that situation? Um, you need thio show a sense of purpose, even if it's not what you personally want. You can't have to put your feelings aside sometimes. Uh, but at the same time, one thing you do you just check on people. How they doing after you? After you give him bad news, you make sure you're very intent about, uh about seeing health, folks you're doing be present. Show them that this is mean in a weird way, showing that you know, you're not. I mean, you're not happy about it either. Perhaps. But at the same time, maybe don't be vocal about it that way. You know it? Yeah. You have to stay out to see what we all have to stay out to sea. We're all in this together, in a way, trying to two and reinforce the camaraderie that hopefully you've been building over that particular period of time."
,,lcdr-barnhl,Who are the core team members (inner circle) who you relied on as a leader?,"the most important folks that you rely on that are subordinate to you are not commission officers, your chief senior chief's master chiefs, the and then writer To them, you're here. First Class Petty Officer's E five. Those are the people that make things run. Uh, and if you if you distance yourself from them, you're gonna have a bad time. That is just a simple fact of life. You must have a good report. They must be on approach. You they must be able to express some discontent. That's what you're there for."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What makes your leadership style unique?,"I'm not sure my leadership style is that unique. Uh, there are, I think they're broad brush. A couple of different good ways to be be a leader. Um, I am very direct. I'm a very direct person. I find comfort in being a superior over a subordinate, and and you have no problem telling the subordinate. You know what I think? As long as it's in a respectful way. Uh, I think that is a This is a technique that is used by by many different leaders. That seems to be effective. One of the things that I take that I think might be slightly unique is it? I really I feel very responsible for my support. It's not just in that they're professional success, but their personal success, too. And that while I think that that is, yeah, we're a required thing. I'm not sure every leader feels that way, But I really do feel, um responsible for helping Ah ah, a sailor. And they're in their personal life. If I could do it and they want me to"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What are some of the things you do really well as a leader that someone could imitate?,"taking carrier people is first and foremost the job of a leader. I think I'm pretty good at that. Uh, in the way I do that is trying to be empathetic to a to a person's situation. I've always been that way s so even though I'm very direct and how I talked with people and handle situations, empathy is a key part of my own personality that I think lends itself well to until the way I lied. And I would recommend folks try to imitate that if they can."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What are the most important decisions that you face daily as a leader in your organization?,"vision that I and that I find or have to make on a daily basis is usually related to a a broader aspect. So my my example would be being the operations officer in the squadron and putting out a flight schedule each day. That flight schedule was in itself a way to manage people getting in the air so they would have experience and getting qualifications. Um, so who to put in the air how to do it? What things? That what type of flights They should be flying. Um was really, uh, for a broader purpose of making sure the people at ours and training that they that they needed."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How do I take lessons from officer school and apply them in real life?,"over going thio perfectly mirror or reality is probably the greatest piece of information that you will look back and take away from your officer training is that you need Thio realized that they're going to be things that you're not going to expect happen to happen. Um, that will help you be okay with that situation. The other part to it is that what they should be teaching you and your officer training is that you don't know everything and that it's okay to not know everything. If you could take those two things away, then you'll you'll be set up pretty well."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What do you need to know about yourself to lead a team?,"There's not something specific that you need to know about yourself. Um, you do need to understand your personality. You need to understand the flaws in your personality, and you need to be willing to handle those flaws effectively. That's very difficult to do because we're naturally inclined to not see flaws in ourselves or at least not act on them, um, to fix them. I mean, so I think, generally speaking, and there's only a general answer. This is like realizing that there are flaws in your personality and being able to pick them out. I would say it's more effect. The question should necessarily be What do you need to know about yourself? Um, but how more of how to directly, uh, deal with the flaws in your personality and a way to do that is basically, have someone that you trust with you. They can point out those flaws on that could be any trusted subordinate or appear, or the tried and true your superiors telling you that you're just plain wrong"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What do you need to know about your team members?,"if you were to pick one thing, uh, to learn about your team members, oftentimes it's where they came from. The matters most, because I can give you a perspective on to how they look at the world. Um, if someone comes from a place where they grew up thinking there's right and there's wrong and there's nothing in between that is very different than someone who might have grown up in a place to I saw a lot of gray. A lot of things that might have been right. It might have been wrong, and, you know, they appreciate the nuances A life. Um, where person came from won't give you every piece of information you need to know about them, but it certainly gives you a starting place."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What are the most important factors about a situation to consider?,"when given any situation, the most important thing you can do Thio kind of assess it, and how you should handle is to kind of realize you and your team's part in that situation. There's an inclination to think about the overall implications of what that situation means, and sometimes that can lead you to think about things that are outside your purview. Um, if you do that, then you can easily get overwhelmed with this situation and trying to think of answers to problems that aren't being asked. Asked about uh, so understanding where you fit in that situation where your team fits in that situation can help bound to the problem so that you can deal with something a little more tractable. Let other people deal with the three other aspects you need to be able to deal with your at your particular responsibility as it applies to that situation."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What are some secret-sauce tips for your leadership style?,"there's no one specific or two specific things that makes a good leader. A leader is built by their experience. There are some people who are inclined to leadership. I think, uh, their personality lends itself to it. But even those people, if they don't have the experience, then oftentimes they can't put problems in decisions into appropriate perspective. So there's not any really one thing or two things or you small things that make one leader great and another not or one leader great. Another good. It's how you use your experiences, Thio relate to your subordinates and lead your subordinates and make decisions that affect your subordinates."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What leadership strategies are dying out?,"leadership comes in all flavors. Um, I'm not sure. I would say that leadership styles are dying out, But what I would say is that we're we find failure anathema, right? It's it's not acceptable. But the reality is we all fail. We all have problems. We all do things that we wish we hadn't done. And they have an impact on other people. The acceptance that failure is a natural part of any career path of any experience in life. Failure is going to happen to everybody at some point, and it's not whether a person failed or not. It's how we learn from that failure. That's where the Mercy Mercy comes in. As faras you know, a leader is concerned. Realizing this just because someone screwed it up doesn't mean they have nothing to add. No, if someone does something wrong, instead of sidelining him, perhaps embrace him, let him know that they did it wrong, but also let him know that they're still part of the team. They're still gonna be included, and they are part of the team's success. When that does come"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What are warning signs for problems in a team?,"There are plenty of that indicators that that suggest a team or group is gonna are gonna have issues. One of the main ones is ah, is I think the, um loosening of standards normalizing that that type of behavior. Um, one thing that one way to keep that in check is by the leader maintaining the standards. And that's both the overall leader. Um, but also the noncommissioned officers, which the in generally speaking of military noncommissioned officers do very well, and they're not afraid to tighten up their supporters. But they're also not afraid it tighten up their junior officers superiors, as is appropriate. Um, generally speaking of maintaining of standards is essential now. Not all every standard is created equal. That's not talking. If if your hair cuts are not that great, that's not the same thing. Is not adhering to safety regulations? Um, the regulation pieces more of what I would I would I would be concerned with, uh, less the the personal appearance, though that is important too."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How can you enforce the honor code?,"you can't enforce any policy code. Uh, by maintaining standards yourself as the leader, uh, he can also be very direct about it. Say, this is the way things were gonna be. Um, but if you exemplify the standard, then people will follow you. There are other aspects that come into play there. Are you relatable, Ari? Do you get along with your with your subordinates? Are you fair? Um but I would say that if you basic very basic, if you maintain the standard and people are required to follow you by virtue of your position, they probably will."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How should I handle people who can't meet their standards?,"So if people are meeting standards, I think they're a couple of ways more than a couple of ways to deal with it first, you can try motivate him. This can work. And I think a lot of times it does work. Um, but not always. You have to. And in order to help someone that is not maintaining standards, you have to understand why they're not maintaining standards. Uh, that can. That may help you come up with a good strategy toe, help them get back up to where they should be. Now, if if someone is consistently failing to meet standards, there comes a point that they may not be cut out for what they're doing, and that's OK. It doesn't necessarily feel okay. It feels like you. Sometimes I feel like you might be giving up on someone. But in the long run, that person is responsible for how they handle themselves. You can't force them to do it. You can facilitate an environment that helps them do it, and you really should do all you can to help them. That's the expectation in the military, but in the in the long run, it's their responsibility to maintain the stage that they won't do it. Then they're gonna need to find another line of work"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What kinds of sailors cause problems in a team and what can you do to improve it?,"There's not one type of sailor that causes problems. Um, but, you know, there there are different when they're they're different types. Uh, cynicism is a way of life in the military. Uh, every just about every military member you meet has a more cynical view of their organization. That's probably what they came into the military with. This becomes more a problem when it's just when it's kind of worn on a person's sleeve. Um, constantly negative, uh, always has some negative to say about what they're doing. Um, and this can have a detrimental impact on on on the team members. Like I said, this is not the only type of person, but it it is one. Um, and you have to be clear right away for those people that that type of behavior is not gonna be acceptable. How do you do that? Uh, well, there's there. There's not necessarily one good answer. Um, but you also might not have a choice to have them on their team. You're gonna have folks that are very, very good at their job. Skill wise. But I have very bad attitudes. Thing happens quite a bit. I've seen it plenty of times. Um but you need thio. You you need to find a way to get to them to connect with them so they don't have a negative impact on the people around them."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How do you get to the root of a problem with a team member?,"There are a number of ways to get to the root of a problem when you're dealing with your team members. Um, one way to do it if you're trying to address something specific with that team member is avoid making them defensive as any way you can. It doesn't mean be meek or anything like that, but maybe approach the problem in directly. Uh, don't tell them you're doing a terrible job. Uh, what you might be able to do is Tottenham positively about what something they're doing. Then discuss the thing they need to fix on. Explain why two. Um, it was just one mechanism that could be used. Thio. Help get to the root problem if if someone is causing an issue with your team."
,,lcdr-barnhl,When is breaking the rules okay?,"So we ask if, if there's a time when breaking the rules is okay, that's, Ah, it seems like a very easy answer. Say no. It's never OK to break the rules, but in the military you'll find that you'll find yourselves in situations that end up being very gray. My example is flying an aircraft. You're given a very large book to read that tells you how to fly an aircraft, and it tells you this is how you handle this emergency procedure and it gives you warnings that gives you cautions that gives, you know, it's a lot of advice on how to handle this, But in the very beginning of that section of the book, it says these air the procedures that you should use her in an emergency, but they are not a substitute for sound judgment. Sometimes sound judgment requires you to break the rules, and I don't mean in an intentional sense where you're just trying to get ready for an inspection and you gun deck all the signatures. I'm talking about breaking the rules. I'm talking more about exceptional situations where you where you have really no other choice, maybe because the safety of the crew. That's the other part of that statement in the book. You're the most important thing about your decision making is the safety of the air crew at that particular point time. And that might drive you to break the rules. So it s Oh, that would be a situation where you could break the rules. But But if you're going to do it, you need to have a very good reason why you are. It should not be the go to almost the rules we have are developed over, you know, two centuries of experience. There's a reason why they exist, even though we might not totally understand it. So going when going with going in with the game plan that every that rules are breakable, is not is not safe, It's not ideal. It should be considered. This is the way I'm gonna do it unless I find myself in it in a particular situation. And those, like I said, those situations are exceptional."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How can I tell when someone can be influenced versus someone who won't change?,"There's not one clear indicator that will tell you if someone could be influenced or not. Usually it's through a time you know, a period of exposure to that person. Um, some people think the way they think and they're not willing to change it. You just have to accept that. But I think it will become readily apparent that that is the case. The more time you spend with him, which is what you should be doing when you're talking about leadership, being a leader with your subordinates."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What conduct issues can mean serious problems if you handle them in-house?,"there are a couple things you should not touch. If you're trying to handle things, uh, you know, especially in your command as a junior officer, you should really never be doing this. You should always. If something's going on, it should be elevated because it's not your responsibility to deal with discipline when it comes to things like non judicial punishment and stuff like that. If you are dealing with anything, involves, uh, alcohol for one any toward any type of sexual abuse assault, hazing, initiations that might be construed as hazing. Hi. Anything like that? Uh, breaking safety protocols. Those things shouldn't I mean, should never be handled in house because that can be a It could be a severe detriment to a command. I've seen that happen where things have been swept under the rug or just kept within, say, a particular shop in a command when really they should have been elevated to the commanding officer in, he should have been dealing with them"
,,lcdr-barnhl,Tell me about a situation where your team and you had a major disagreement about how to handle something.,"So when I was the operations officer, uh, my last squadron, my commanding officer just taken over and our particular squadron would had a LOL of deployment. So we often got tasks with Tasked with a lot of non glamorous, unglamorous types of things. And specifically, we were tasked with doing some cargo off load between one ship and putting it on land. What my commanding officer wanted I want to do because it's kind of a tradition is to give give the sailors a long weekend, but because we're gonna have to be part of this, uh, the cargo off load, We couldn't do that. So my my particular position was, Well, we got to be part of it anyway, So let's throw all in, uh, make the most of it. And my dad idea is making the most of it was to support with Max effort as best we could. My commanding officer decided that that he was I think he wanted to make a point that we were not gonna be responsible for everything. Um, and he he wanted other people to be a be a part of it, and I kind of disagree. I kind of disagreed with that. Not not because other people shouldn't be part of it, but because I felt like his response was a bit petulant. Um, a lot of good could come of us doing that, and he could have given a long weekend at another time. Um, I lost that argument a CZ as subordinates or want to do this type situation, But that was one situation where there was disagreement in our team and I was a subordinate."
,,lcdr-barnhl,Tell me about a time where your priorities conflicted with the priorities of your management.,"It's hard to say because you're you're part of the command, your priorities should align. What I could say is that there are times when the commands priorities did not align with the the tear of command above. That's priority of us priorities. Um, so in a Nativity in aviation, you have several different squadrons, and their squadrons belong to the wing, and there's a wing commander and usually tasking comes through the wing and is given out in his dispersed amongst the squadron's, depending on Operation tempo and all that type of thing. Uh, the wing typically does not care too much about what your person, what your personal command problems are. You can always voice them, but they often times say, That's nice to know. Now do what I had to do. Do it, we're telling you to d'oh! So there are plenty of times where that has come into play. One of them, specifically was being prepared to help put out what wildfires in Southern California and a lot of the hoops we had to jump through to make that be a possibility was was truly frustrating. But nonetheless, we had to do it, how we didn't have a choice"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What kind of risks do you need to take in this field?,"the types of risk that you have to take in, being in the military or innumerable and subject to the type of community that you're in. But generally speaking, one of the one of the roles that you take on when becoming commission is you become a decision maker and there's always a risk in decision making. And some people are very comfortable making decisions, other people or not, but nonetheless you, even if you're uncomfortable with it, you are a decision maker. I've had those decisions might come and just how you're gonna handle your helicopter when you're flying around tomorrow to decisions that allow you plenty of time to think about it. Um, I think it's important to realize that the risk in decision making isn't what your commanding officers think of you, though That comes into play, certainly, but it's more of, uh, that there might be multiple ways to do something correctly, and that's okay. Uh, a lot of times we think of decision in terms of risk of what other people might think. Did we do the right thing? Well, there might be multiple right things, and it's hard to to think about it in that particular context. Um, but all told, you're going encounter so many different types of risk throughout your career. I think risk and decision making is probably the most important thing to consider as you start out."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What problems or warning signs should you not try to solve and refer up to specialists instead?,"if you have problems in your command, Uh, you before you go external to the command and talk about you getting advice from specialist, the first thing you do is elevated elevate the problem specifically to the commanding officer because he's ultimately the arbiter. Something such things. Now you as you're elevating this problem, you can explain him that you have a good idea on who to reach out to. But sometimes simply reaching out is not the right thing to do because there are other implications there. So So it's There are times to reach out, especially if you have. If you eso won. A good example is you have an aircraft crash. You know you're going to have to reach out a specialist on that. If you're part of the investigation team, that is a fact that's natural. Uh, but if it's something you're not sure about, there should be a healthy discussion in the squatter before reaching out to the specialist to determine what to do. Now, if you're talking more along the lines of something happens within the squatter and you think you can handle it with the skill professionals in your unlisted ranks, that's a little bit different. I don't think you should ever be afraid to reach out to The folks that are working on your aircraft are working on your machines, on the ships or anything like that to get their opinion on how they would particularly handle something like that. When you talk when you're talking about, ah, skill set, no matter what, you need, the advice of people like that to help you make the distant those types of decisions."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What do you do when given an impossible situation due to failures that you didn't cause?,"if you find yourself in difficult situation, that wasn't your fault of the year there. There's not much you can do but just kind of roll with a roll with it, Um, that that's not an abnormal situation, not necessarily of failures. But, uh, things are more difficult than maybe they should be. But the reality of situation is, if there's nothing you could d'oh, there's nothing. There's nothing at that particular time. Then you just have to deal with this situation, and perhaps you can make it better as you deal with it. Maybe you can institute things that would prevent you from prevent people from getting to that situation further down the line. It might not be something specific you can do to fix it right then, but maybe you should focus on what you can do to prevent that from happening again."
,,lcdr-barnhl,"How do you deliver bad news, such as a family emergency?","handling bad news is one of the worse things to deal with as a leader, but you have to be responsible for it. Um, the best thing you can do is be direct about it. Don't dance around the issue. Uh, be very. Matter of fact, this is the situation. This is what we need to do. This is what we can do about it. Or if there's nothing you could do about it, Uh, you know, make that perhaps make that clear to, But on the flip side of that, make it clear that you and the entirety of the command is going to help however they can in whatever the situation may be, whatever the bad news might might entail, the command needs to be at the disposal of the member to help out, however they can."
,,lcdr-barnhl,Why do people leave the Navy?,"folks tried from the Navy from all for all different reasons. There's not one that you can put your finger on. Some folks are tired of the operational tempo. Some folks are just just want to use. The Navy gets a skill set, and perhaps she's the g I bill after the fact, and that's totally okay. Let's be clear. There's nothing wrong with leaving the Navy. There's nothing wrong with leaving military service. Not every person needs to be a career sailor, soldier, marine or airman. It would be a problem if that was the case, huh? Some people just get tired. Sometimes. A family situation is tthe e drives, leaving the service. You need stability for your Children. Some people are fed up with the general. The mentality of the military service, the conformity of that's required to be in the military. Um, all of that is totally acceptable, and it should not be frowned upon"
,,lcdr-barnhl,How can I work smarter?,"you could be more efficient. How you work as a leader first by a delegation on being clear about what you want from your subordinates. You have to understand that you can't do everything as a leader you want to be, and sometimes you feel like you need to be. But you can't do it. It's impossible. So that means that you have to use the resource is that is the people that you have working for you to get the job done. Tell them what you want. Tell them what you expect the output to be. Not not. No way that doctors the output just like here. This is what I want is what I want you to look at, Uh, and tell them a timeframe. If you don't tell him a time frame, they won't give you. Give it to you when you want it. That's just a fact. Be very specific about you when you want it. There are no doubt many other ways to be more efficient now in your working environment. But realizing that you can't do everything after you realize that delegating and being clear about what you want our to our three ways that you can make your life better"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What else do I need to know?,"you could read all the books in the world about good leadership and you wouldn't know enough. Uh, a lot of it is on the job training and observing the leaders that you like and the leaders that you didn't like and then adapting perhaps their leadership styles to yours, huh? There many definitions off what leadership should be, and I cannot tell you everything you need to know about being a good leader. If there's anything I would in part, look at your experiences and look at the people that lead you or the observed leading to develop your own leadership style."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What's up?,not much. How are you?
,,lcdr-barnhl,How is the weather?,It's a sunny California day.
,,lcdr-barnhl,How are you?,"I'm doing well, Thank you."
,,lcdr-barnhl,Where are you?,"I'm in Monterey, California."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What is your favorite color?,my favorite color is blue.
,,lcdr-barnhl,What's your favorite book of all time? Why?,"My favorite book of all time is called A Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson. It is a very concise book about the about scientific development through the centuries is a very tractable and readable for ah, lay person. That's not that doesn't come from a science background."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What's your favorite movie of all time? Why?,"my favorite movie of all time is called The Royal Tenenbaums, which is directed by Wes Anderson. I like it because it is is somewhat humorous, but in kind of a melancholy way, and that's the type of thing that I I like watching."
,,lcdr-barnhl,Where were you born?,"I was born in Greensboro, North Carolina."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What is your favorite food?,"my favorite food is my wife's pen, a vodka."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What is your least favorite food?,beats.
,,lcdr-barnhl,What was the coolest thing you did in the Navy?,"I can't narrow it down to the coolest thing I've ever done in the Navy, but I sure did enjoy flying around Mount Fuji in Japan quite a bit."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What is the best military perk you experienced?,one of the best things about being in the military has been the opportunity to live overseas. I don't think I would have been able to do that in such a way if I had not been in the military.
,,lcdr-barnhl,What have you done that got a lot press?,"thing I've done in the Navy that's gotten a lot of press, really two things, and they're both of all flying. I'm not necessarily good. Uh, the first time the first was when I was doing a cross country flight from Atsugi, Japan, down to Okinawa. Thio, begin some training. About halfway down my engine, cowling came open. Uh, and I was looking for a place to land so I could close it. What we were worried about is that the engine cowling would come off and then get in our rotor system, and we would have had and we would have crashed aircraft. Well, we ended up doing because, as you know, the the shore of Japan can be fairly dropped fairly precipitously is you know, we tried to maybe find a beach. The only beach we found plenty of had a lot of people on it. But as you move down the beach, that kind of the crowd's kind of dispersed. So we ended up landing on the beach and I thought that I'd gotten kind of away with it. Not that I was trying to get away with anything, but as soon as we landed Japanese, gentlemen, stepped out of the woods and just colic and just looked at us, was probably fairly surprised that helicopter was there. We shut down, we closed up. And then after I called my my squadron to let him know what had happened, we took back off and without incident, unfortunately. So that that got a little bit of notice. The other thing. I was in a helicopter crash about 10 years ago, and that must surely got a lot of press."
,,lcdr-barnhl,Tell me a funny story.,"so do your time as a leader. You'll and you'll have a lot of different experiences that you'll consider that you won't believe you will have. Some of them will be truly extraordinary and b thankfully, Adam others You just think I cannot believe that that just happened. Um, one of the, uh, one has somewhat tragic. Not exactly funny is that we had a sailor who decided Thio go hiking on a long weekend. Um, well, and this is in Eastern San Diego County, where a lot of desert in their rattlesnakes there have been here tonight about seven miles. And then he reached down and was moving some six. Elway got bit by a rattlesnake. His method of taking care of that problem to prevent the venom from spreading was to shoot off with a gun. His thumb, which, as you might know, is not going to stop the venom from spending spreading. Fortunately, he was able to get that situation and get to a hospital and saved his life. But that's just an example of the types of things that you no doubt will experience. Another one was when we had a sailor who was drunk. He was walking back to his barracks, decided he could not make it the extra 50 feet to get inside and in his room. So he went to sleep under our duty van. The next morning, the duty driver started of the van and ran him over. He broke the guy's back and the guy was medically discharged from the Navy. It's sad. It was truly kind of a sad situation."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What person do you most admire and why?,"There are plenty of people that I admire, and many of them I have come into contact with, uh, while being in the Navy. Uh, one of those was one of my department heads in when I was a junior officer. He was a fantastic leader and he gave me a lot of insight. It turns out, despite him, how he would have been a great commanding officer. He was he was passed over for command, and that was a big blow to him. But I always admired him for how well they handle it and how well he kept being a good leader even after finding out that he was the that that news. And I just thought, even in a perceived failure, he was still a fantastic leader. And that's something that I always took the heart."
,,lcdr-barnhl,"If you could meet anyone in the world today, who would it be and why? What would you say to that person?","and there's somebody that I could meet and talk with. I think I would like to talk with the former secretary of defense, Robert Gates, uh, here. Fairly significant impact across two presidencies. Uh, and he's been in government a long time, so I think he would be an interesting provide some interesting insights that I could glean a lot from an apply to my leadership style."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How long does it take to complete training for your specialty?,"It took about two years for me to complete Pilot trained to be actually designated a naval aviator, a supportive and keep in mind that just because you finished pilot training, it doesn't mean the learning stops. There are several different qualifications you then have to attain over the course of your career, so basically, you're in a state of continuing education for the 1st 10 years of your career."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What advice do you have for someone trying to complete that training?,"in order to complete pilot training, you just need to be diligent about your studies. They do not intentionally make it difficult. Thio make it through. They make it challenging, um, as it should be, Um, but the overall goal is not necessarily to fail people out. It's it's toe just civilly challenge the those that are there, and it's so challenging that someone doesn't want to do it any more than you know. They have the option option. Thio move to a different a different community if they so desire. So really just just being diligent and, you know, examine if the if it's still what you really want to do on, that's regards of what community you want."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?,"the challenges you're gonna face in your career far and wide. There's there's not one specific thing type of thing you're gonna encounter. They can range from the personal, too professional to social. Even I was in a helicopter crash, and that was one of the most formative experiences in my life. It took a lot of humility in order to make it through that. In fact, I'm sure that if I had not been humble about it and owned up to the fact that it was our fault that it occurred that they would not have let me fly again. But in the end he did, and I know that I was a better pilot and a better officer for it."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What is the most challenging part about your job?,"The most challenging part about being a naval officer is the interaction with the different types of people, which, incidentally, is one of the best parts of the job, too. You have to learn how to motivate people, and you have to. I also realized that some folks you're you're just not gonna be able to reach. It's not your fault, but it is one of the biggest challenges you can. You can. You'll come across because if you can't motivate somebody, if you can get someone to continue or go down a path that you think they should go down, it would be positive. For them, it feels like a failure. The reality is it's really not a failure. It's just it's just they, perhaps or not willing. T o do what you think they should do, and that's okay."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What is the biggest failure you ever had and what did you learn from it?,"without a doubt, The biggest failure I ever had was when I was in a helicopter crash in 2011. We crash in your craft, and it was totally our fault. We thought we were doing everything right. And turns out we messed up one calculation. And when we did that, we had a false perception of reality. Essentially, Um, so unfortunately, no one died. We all walked away, but it was a very humbling experience. A lot of the times when you see people make mistakes in your career field and doesn't matter if you're in the military or not, I think you your initial responses. How could that person possibly have done that? That seems so silly and stupid. But the reality is we're all walking on a very fine line of failure and success, and we all will experience failure sometime during our career. Feels it might not be as extreme as as that as crashing an aircraft, but it will happen and only thing you can do is learn from it. The thing I learned from it was that is just basically what I said. Failure is a natural part of any career. It's going to happen, you need to be humble through it. If you're not humble, then you can't learn from it. And that's That's the on Lee. That's one of those. If nothing else. That's the good you can take from a really bad situation. The other good. Another good you can take from it is that it allows you perspective on other people's failures. It is very important, Uh, failure, as I said, is going to happen is gonna happen in your unit and probably the people that work for you. We're gonna fail and you're gonna learn, need to learn how to deal with their failure, especially when it impacts you. If you cannot perhaps show mercy or you realize that it's not a systemic failure, Uh, you know, you got to realize that maybe they can learn from it and be better than they are right now."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What are the failures for which you are the most unhappy?,"Well, the one failure that I has had the most impact is is being in a helicopter crash. That was my fault. But there are certainly some other smaller failures that you had had an impact. But I was I think I was fortunate enough to have bosses that didn't see a singular failure as a trend. Um, and it wasn't automatically assumed that I was bad at my job. Uh, hold on all I have had a pretty successful career, and I've done pretty well. Um, so I mean, the one that certainly sticks out is surely the helicopter crash."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How accepting of failure is this work environment when a good and honest effort was made?,"Generally speaking, the military is not terribly accepting of failure. We'll keep people around me, is lying. I mean, as long as it's not a hey large start that over. Generally speaking, the military is I have experienced. It has not been that accepting of failure, despite me having been given a significant second chance after my helicopter crash. However, there are plenty of examples where you see that somebody has failed and they have been fired right away. Um, and part of it, I think, is because it is a seeming hope. High profile. You have high profile failures, often times, uh, that bleeds, too. Command relief and other things like that. Um, I do not think that is a good way to handle any organization because failure is inevitable, even high profile failures. It's necessary to think about how you're going to handle handle those and those people that are involved with those failures because you can't just get rid of people because they fail. They still have value to add. In fact, one might say that, uh, that failing helps a person learn more. They might be in a better position. Tau lead. After a failure like that"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What are sources of support when you took a chance and the result was poor?,"So after my helicopter crash, I think it would have been very easy for folks. Toe Oster size me, Um, because it was so high profile. But I had a commanding officer who went to bat for me, and he, I think, single handedly made sure I was able to fly again. Along with that, the folks that I worked with were tremendously supportive. They were not derisive, though I wouldn't have blamed him if they could have been or if they were so just. The people that I worked with were remarkably supportive. Uh, and that is one reason why I wanted to fly again, huh? Because those people put forth the effort to support me during that time."
,,lcdr-barnhl,"How does someone recover from a professional ""bump in the road""?","people can recover from professional miscues, but it just might not be in the way you think it is. Um, there's sometimes at the recovery is not a continued progression down that career path, but finding some other metric of success that that is meaningful to you on. You have to accept that. Sometimes there isn't just not gonna be an avenue for you to proceed after a proverbial bump in the road. So if you want to stay in, you might have to define your own metric of success and what that looks like. It might not look like a metric metric of success that is typical and the military sense, such as moving on to commanding officer or anything like that. But as long as you are finding that what you're doing as a as a measure of success, not really think that's all that matters"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What was a pivotal moment in your career/life?,"a pivotal moment in my career was the moment I found out that I was gonna be able to fly again and realizing how much effort it took for people to make that happen, because it wasn't me that did it. I helped. It required me to be humble and accept responsibility for something that I could not have conceived of doing before it happened before with a helicopter crash. But it, but realizing that there are people that are willing to put their reputations on the line on the line for me was extremely impactful, and that defined largely how I wanted to be a leader. After that point that taught me, I thought, one of the major lessons of leadership that I've learned in my career as faras Ole life pivotal event There are so many that I could count, but the obvious ones. They're having kids and getting married and all those things that that change your life more than you could ever conceive of"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What's the biggest risk you've taken in your career?,"I don't think there is a particular career risk that I can point Thio there was that truly gave me any sort of anxiety, but I think it's more more, I think you know what? What, what types of duty stations do you want to go to type thing? Perhaps. I think going to Japan was a risk, you know, But it was more risk in that it was going to strain my marriage. Not necessarily a bad away. But, you know, we were newly married relatively, and we decided to go to Japan with where there was a high operational tempo. So I was gonna have way had a fresh marriage, and we're gonna be separated relatively shortly after being married. You know that that was a risk. I ended up working out. Well, for us, that was they'd been in the end, it made us both stronger. But I can't say that I have had a particular career risk, a choice that I've made the biggest risk I could say. I guess I would say, Is it going to school going back to school at the time that I did? Because this type of education is not always seen fondly from a career perspective"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What is the most dangerous thing you've ever done on the job?,"there's not particularly one most dangerous thing I've ever done. Flying helicopters. The nature of being a helicopter pilot is dangerous because helicopters don't want to fly. Um, but you can point to any night flying over the ocean when there's no moon or it's cloudy and raining where you can't see much and you're susceptible to, uh, various physiological effects that can. I mean, they could put you in the water very easily, uh, one of the most normal and yet harrowing experiences that any helicopter pilot has, and they had him all the time is doing night landings on the back of small ships. You're basically putting a helicopter down in a small space with a wall right in front of you. If you if you do it poorly, then your rotor blades, you're gonna hit the ship. Uh, that is that's pretty for as often as we do it, I still don't feel terribly comfortable doing. I have hundreds of landing on the back of ships at night,"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What causes the most stress in your job?,"most stress as a naval officer is wondering, what somebody is going to do is your subordinate. That's gonna have an impact on your life and how you're gonna answer for it to your boss. For better or worse, the mistakes of your subordinates are projected on you, and they're there for they are reflection on you as a leader. It's a lot of stress because you have a lot of people working for you and they can come up with all types of ways to get in trouble or make poor decisions. That does indeed cause a lot of stress."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How do you keep stress from boiling over?,"stress on the job as a naval officer is not that different than any other line of work. The stresses air different, perhaps or more. But the way you deal with it isn't that different. One of the main ways is just take care of yourself. He relatively well do something that you like doing. I, for one, shows toe play tennis a lot, and that was a huge stress relief. If I'm under way, then you exercise, read books, watch movies. If one of the things that I've learned is that if you're not taking care of yourself, the people that are relying on you will also suffer, and that's not a position you want to put yourself in."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How do you handle self doubt?,"self doubt is his pervasive. You always question whether you're doing the right thing. A SZ faras from a skill standpoint where, like flying, teaching, um, or even performing. If you're being evaluated, you just got it. It's remarkable. Once you actually get in the situation, I found that the doubt oftentimes evaporates because you proved yourself that you know what you're talking about and you know what you're doing. Self doubt is really more poisonous in and the time before you have to execute something or do something that is of consequence on the ways to handle that or just are myriad. You can think of all kinds of ways to do it. I often times would just go for a run or physical activity in general, try to take my mind off it. But in the moment, generally, you find that the choices you made the decisions you make, even if where they weren't the best decisions, they were still okay because you appropriately evaluated things"
,,lcdr-barnhl,How do you handle fatigue at work?,"if I'm fatigued at work, which is often for naval officers in general. Sometimes you gotta fight through it, and it's nice strength. It's not like it's not as if it's a weakness to be fatigued. Sometimes things just need to get done, and there's not really any other choice, but just to move past it. If you cannot all possible, you need to listen to your doctors and you tell you how much sleep you should get, so you can kind of avoid those things. But life oftentimes doesn't allow that, and especially as a pilot but in other communities to you'll find you have an erratic, skeet sleep schedule, so you really just do the best you can to get to sleep you need."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How do you ensure that boring work gets done well?,"There is plenty of work that isn't very invigorating or interesting that you're going to deal with. You got to do a lot of paper filing a lot of just putting ah, different forms together to get signed, to maintain qualifications for people as very thankless. But part of the reason it's easy to get those things done is because the consequences of that stuff not being done a fairly dire if someone doesn't get there, they're flying paperwork, training, paperwork signed off by the commanding officer. Then they can't fly, and that's not an acceptable situation. So even if it's boring, it's pretty easy to make it happen."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How do you deal with an increase in tempo?,"when Operation Operation Tempo increases. There's not a particular thing that I do. Um, this work is challenging, and even if you're not, even if you're not, uh, about to deploy your operation tip, it was high. Anyway. It just stays high and will always be high, no matter what community know what matter what community you're in. So it's almost as if once it moves past the point, it's really ends up. You do. It's all the same to you at my level. Is it? When I was a department head, I was responsible for all types of things. All the time. Required my attention on dear, just you. You just deal with it. You just do the job, get one thing done at a time. If you can handle it, and pretty soon you just move through it all. And that's really the best. The best advice I can give about handling a high optempo situation"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What are common crimes people in your field commit that need to be watched for?,"There isn't any particular crime that is committed relative related to the profession. That, I would say needs to be watched for the things that do need to be watched for our use of things like you could use of alcohol, sexual abuse, hazing, which, in and of themselves, they're not allowed. And some of those certainly would be classified as crimes. But others are more like behaviors. Um, if there is any, uh, any evidence that sexual abuse, assault harassment is going on, that needs to be stopped immediately, and it needs to be elevated immediately because the longer languishes the worst it's gonna be for everybody. And the other part, it's not just about and this is more important, it's not just about ensuring the command. Uh, the command record is kept clean, but more important for the individual that's experiencing that, Uh, because if someone, if one person is experiencing that, then that means there's potential for more. And while it's tragic that people do experience that type of thing once that happens, there's not much you can do about other. Stop it immediately and prevent it from happening again. Okay,"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What part of your future are you most worried about?,"I think there's always worries about your future when it comes to, uh, the Naval professional military all one of the things we don't give enough credit two is the effect of timing on your career. Timing has a huge part to play when it comes to career career promotion. You know most people can make it to lieutenant lieutenant commander without much trouble. But at that point there is an extreme filtering process that occurs and you see you lose, you know, losing a lot of people, Um, because they may not have screened for command because there's only so many command slots. And a lot of times that could be due to effect of timing. There's more detailed answer with regard to that that you'll learn about as you experienced the effect of detail ing. Uh, but, uh, that's ends up being a pretty big deal when there's nothing you can control over it, either."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What used to be your biggest weaknesses?,"my biggest weakness used to be that argue might still be, uh, that the freighter, the fear that my decisions were not the right ones. But then I came to the conclusion that just because my decision wasn't necessarily the decision that another person might make it doesn't make it wrong. It just made it different. They're different ways to tackle the various problems. Um, and it just because someone does it differently doesn't make you wrong."
,,lcdr-barnhl,Describe a time that you were put into an untenable ethical situation?,"the only time that I could perceive of, we could see our conceive of being in an unethical situation would be if my superiors put me there and I have never been in that position, so I think it can happen. But I have been fortunate enough to for not to happen to me."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How do I deal with an assignment that I don't like or that isn't a good fit?,"one of the things about the military and being an officer in general is that you don't get that you don't necessarily get the choice of what you are told to do or not do. Um, I've had to do a lot of things I didn't want to dio that didn't make it a bad thing to do. I just didn't particularly want to do it. But the only option I had was to complete the job, and I did that. You'll find yourself in that to have a situation many times. Sometimes it is probably best to just put your head down and get the job done."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What things are there for me to do on a ship?,"One of the things about being at sea is that you kind of feel like you're on an island, which you'd in essence, are, and it's going to depend on the type of ship you're on. If you're on a small ship, then things are more limited, but you'll still be able to exercise in various ways. You'll even probably getting get clever about how you do it. Bring plenty of books with you movies, Air our thing, and you know you can also start different types of organizations to, you know, whatever play cards or whatever. There's plenty of things to do, but there are certainly limitations."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What happens if you fail to qualify in your professional specialty?,"they're couple things that you have to consider. If you don't qualify and in various forms, I would break this down into a couple situations. First, you know whether you qualify or not to get your wings. Um, if that doesn't happen that often times you might just be redesignated to a different type of community. Um, if if you have gone your wings, but then there's a specific qualification that you have to get. Once you reach your squadron, then you can ask to be redesignated. But sometimes you're just going to get told that you need to qualify because you are needed as a person in that bill. It other times you might be sent to fill another specific job that perhaps they haven't been able to fill, and you don't get the choice of it. I've seen all three of those things happen to various people throughout my time in the Navy"
,,lcdr-barnhl,Are you married?,"Yes, I am married."
,,lcdr-barnhl,Do you have any kids?,I do. I have three.
,,lcdr-barnhl,Do you have siblings?,I have one brother.
,,lcdr-barnhl,Do you have any pets?,I have a cat.
,,lcdr-barnhl,How much free time do you have in your career?,"free time ebbs and flows, depending on the on the type of tour I'm on for a short tour, you probably have more free time than others and then say you're on a C tour, and also, depending on how you look at it, you might have more time deployed, say, on an aircraft carrier than you would at home, depending on what the situation is. Um, I would say, Of course, the most free time you have is definitely at on a on a short tour, but that also depends on what type of shorts where you're doing."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How often do you ever take work home with you?,"the longer you spend in your career there more often, you'll take work home with you as a junior officer, not as much, but as you proceed through on your disassociated and follow one department tours. You will take it home quite often."
,,lcdr-barnhl,Does being a leader give you flexiblity to alter your work schedule?,"work schedule. Flexibility is on Lee, based on what your superior wants you to do. Um, even being a leader, even being the superior other people doesn't automatically mean you can flex your work schedule just because you want to. And in fact, there is an argument that that some people might make that your work schedule should be more stringent than those working below you. I was fortunate and that my superiors wanted me to get my work done and if I did not need to be there, and my our shop had gotten everything done than we were good to go. But it does. Just because you're a leader doesn't automatically mean you have flexibility, your work hours."
,,lcdr-barnhl,"How does being a leader change your lifestyle?(frequent travel, irregular hours, family difficulties etc)","because you're responsible for other people. It's automatically gonna change how you how you work, how you live, what you're thinking about and how much you travel. Um, you are pretty much accessible all the time because if someone in your chain of command does something wrong, you're gonna hear about it, and then you're going to need to elevate elevate that information when necessary. Uh, how much travel you do will certainly depend on you know what your responsibilities are? I've been in situations where I have had to travel much at all in other situations where I did, um, other times, You know, if you're if you're getting ready for deployment, you're pretty much all traveling. So, uh, being a leader doesn't necessarily auto doesn't automatically mean you're going to do more traveling than not, but it certainly could lead to that"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What is a good approach for selecting a new duty station in terms of finding an area for my family to live in?,"when choosing a new duty station and determining whether it's good for your family or not. Their implicit questions there, uh, does your does your spouse work? Uh, are you what type of regain it can run from. What type of? Whether you like it. Uh, so what type of schools you're gonna be around for your kids, what type of experiences you want them to have and you're gonna There's gonna be sacrifices and do those choices regardless. So if you choose to go overseas, the schools might not be as good. Um, then, if you stayed in the United States, uh, however, that experience could be a tremendous experience for both you and your Children. Uh, there's not really a good, uh, way to answer that question, but it really just depends what's important to you, your spouse and how it affects your Children."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What are the things I should prioritize when picking housing?,"when I was a junior officer, I never really thought about choosing housing, really It all. There's not a good answer for that. I think it's really what makes you happy when it comes to comes to choosing that type of thing. Um, I know that if you go to flight school in in Pensacola and then your subsequently in Milton flying in Milton, you know that particular that basis, kind of out of the way. So you're gonna have to you have to count for a drive time in traffic time and things like that. But really, it's like the nuts. There's those types of things you have to decide whether they're important to you or not."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What options do you have to transfer or change if you or your family needs it?,"the Navy has what's called the exceptional family member program, E f M. And if your family, if a member of your family contracts some sort of problem that is considered high risk, they won't let you go to certain duty stations. And if it occurs while added duty station, they'll do an assessment. And either, I mean, one thing that could happen is the They could make the family move while the member stays in place. Um, and there might be a possibility of the entire family moving if it's a mid tour. But that's unlikely. They'd be more likely to just have, say, the members family move, um, and the members stay in place and finish the tour."
,,lcdr-barnhl,"What impact will a hardship tour have on your friends or family, and what advice would one offer?","hardship tour is called a hardship tour. For that reason, it's gonna be hard. They're different flavors of hardship tour in different locations, some. Sometimes it involves separation from your family for a significant period of time. Um, but you know it. The only advice I can I can really give is that it is probably for a short period of time. And you could feel that you need to make sure that your family is well set up so that if problems occur, they can more easily deal with him. As best as you can tell. I can guarantee you that no matter what, uh, the it will be hard for them. But it was good. And it's gonna mean the very nature of the Navy and the deployment schedules and things like that. It's gonna make it hard on the family anyway."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How early should I get my family involved in the process of planning my next career step?,"career decisions do not occur in a vacuum earlier. You involve your family and the decision of the better. You will not be making decisions on your own, um, by including your spouse or significant other in the decision making process, you'll alleviate any resentment that might occur. So do it early."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What has been your favorite place to live? Why?,"I really enjoyed living in Japan because there's a very unique experience. I learned a lot there, got exposed to many other things, went to many different port calls that otherwise wouldn't have gone to. I also had a great squadron to be a part of. There was a lot of camaraderie there, and I think it really epitomized what I thought the Navy would have been like."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What is an example of a conflict you had between your career and family life? How did you learn from it?,"Well, what if you're married in the military, then you pretty much are in a permanent state of conflict because your spouse, whether they like it or not, are subject to what your career trajectory is. He or she does not have a choice in that. Now you can do the best you can to soften the blow, but the Navy very well might decide that you need to go somewhere. That does not provide a lot of opportunity for your spouse. That's the biggest conflict I see. And I don't think there's any good, necessarily good resolution to that, other than to say that it will be for a short period, relatively short period of time and time is always on your side when these things occur."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How do you manage both career and family effectively?,"I don't think that managing a career and family is any different inside the military is outside. I think the stressors air more because of the the deployments that you end up on in the time spent away. But thoughts on how to manage it are pretty similar. I would say you have to think further head probably because you know the deployments are going to come. And you gotta think about how you're going to anticipate how you're how you can help your family before these deployments occur. Um, the theat of doing that, I think, goes a long way to alleviate family stress and perhaps resentment, too."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What should I get ready to live overseas?,"if you're going overseas. First of all, congratulations. That's a good thing. Um, I think one of the first things you can do is just learn about learn a little bit about where you're going. Um, I knew a lot of people that came out to Japan when I was there, and they didn't want to go there. Uh, I was fortunate enough to go out. There is a mid shipment, so I knew a little bit about what I was getting into. But not everybody does that. So but learning a little bit about the place you're going understand? Learning a little bit about the culture helps put it in perspective. And you might find some things that you like that you didn't realize you're going to like what I can. I can say that that being overseas is with the best experiences of I've ever had, and I would recommend it to anybody. But if you don't want to go and the Navy tells you that you're going to go, then uh, it's best if you just embrace it and then kind of dive straight into it. Despite the resentment you might feel"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What resources should I look for when I know I am moving to a location?,"If you're if you're moving to a new location, it's and you're married. You should encourage your spouse to reach out to any spouse network that's already there. Those folks are already there, and you'll learn this that the spouse network will provide all kinds of information and is a wealth of knowledge of the goods and bads of any of any area. Um, highly, highly recommend that they're certainly formal research sources like the the family, the family readiness centers there are generally on each base. They can provide general information about schools in the area and pull and you know, perhaps some little information. But they can also provide you some housing information, military housing information in the event you choose to go that route."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What kind of things may fall between the cracks when moving?,"when you move to a new place. Oh, are in the process of moving to a new place. A lot of it's very formalized. S o. You know, there's definitely a procedure for doing it if you stay organized than very few things really willful. Uh, you do need to think about the important papers that you're going to take with you. That could be a bit. That can be a bit cumbersome if you realize that you needed something and then you ended up packing it away. Because once you send your stuff away, you're not going to see it for a decent amount of time. How long it takes you to move. So So just anticipating the things you're gonna need now your new duty station before your household goods shipments arrive is a good thing to think about"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What should I get ready before I deploy?,"If you're married before you deploy, you need to think about a little, uh, a living will. Um, you need thio. Anything that you know your spouse will have trouble with doing by themselves. Trying to make it any way you could make that easier for them is very important. You remember when you deploy, you're typically going to a ship, and if you forget something, someone can send it to you. So it's not terribly. It's not a terrible thing, if you for forget something. But it's more of what will cause you. Stress is if something occurs back home that you have that you could have controlled, but you don't have anything place to control it then. So that's what you need to focus on ensuring your family as well set up and taking care of before you leave home as faras stuff taking with you on deployment that you'll learn about that when you talk with your fellow jails and that shouldn't be too much of a stressor"
,,lcdr-barnhl,How do you stay in touch with family?,"Staying in touch with family at while you're deployed is not terribly hard. There's email generally, so you don't and you have journal access to it almost all the time. They do have phones on ships that you can sometimes dial out, but it's not terribly convenient. And the delay is is is noticeable. When you're talking to them. Eso it's ah, it's a uh that's not necessarily reliable, but there are plenty of ways to keep in touch email being the most prevalent."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How do you ensure your family is taken care of when you are away?,"the way you make sure your family is taking care of this simply to plan ahead. Talk with your spouse about things that are coming up and how you can anticipate it. Anticipate the problems that may arise. Make sure you both know you both have access to all important documents and, you know, the in your bank accounts and all that stuff Ah, living will is important to have if you can if you swing and swing it. Um, but really generous. Um, general planning will alleviate a lot of stress about, uh, for your family before you deploy."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What is the best plan for contingencies if your family has an emergency and you are away?,"because there are all kinds of emergencies that could occur while you're away. Um, you can't come up with an all encompassing list, but really, what you need to do is just think generally about what things can occur. Talk it over with your spouse and come up with the general plan of how you would handle it. Uh, usually your family is not gonna be alone and unafraid they'll have. They'll have access to other families that have deployed members. They might have extended family available to see how you can incorporate those groups of people into your planning process, too."
,,lcdr-barnhl,"What is military vacation like? (Length, accural rate, types of leave)","you will. All officers will accrue leave at the rate of 2.5 days per month, which eagles out to 30 days a year. Uh, you will not be able to use 30 days a year, and you will largely usually accumulate leave to the point where they make you lose some. I believe it's about 60. At 60 days, you can accrue anymore leave. So, uh, with that in mind, usually when you have it, when you have the opportunity, I was always told, Leave is a mission, so and we don't and we want to avoid people losing leave if we can all help it so encourage as a leader encouraging people to take leave, they will work hard enough to deserve it, whether now or later. So don't be afraid to take leave. Sometimes it may be denied, but that's usually the exception."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What is the best way to be happy with your time in the service?,"there is not one particular situation that I can think of where I be wood, I mean absolute happiness in the service. I think one of the things you need to consider is simply look at what you're doing and try and enjoy what you're doing right now. Right at this moment, don't look too far in the future. Anticipate the future. But don't don't look so far ahead that you're missing what you're doing right now, because you'll do a lot of incredible things. You'll do a lot of things that will frustrate you, too, but there's no really one way that will determine your happiness in the service other than just have a positive attitude about what you're doing."
,,lcdr-barnhl,"As a parent, what habits from military leadership are helpful or problematic?","what you need to remember about your family as it is. Just that is your family. It is not the military. Things that are problematic is our about military culture. As related to the family is the member can often be. I could speak to myself. You won't be very direct about things that's a distinctly military quality. There's not necessarily appropriate for the family he needs to. You need to be a bit more sympathetic than you might otherwise be. If you're in the military when you're dealing with your family and basically you just have to temper their responses, you might have if, uh when it when you're dealing with your family because, like I said, they aren't in the military. Some good things that occur from the military experience spirits is that you know you can. It's a bit easier to instill discipline and your Children early. Show them what it's like. Um, that is definitely a good thing that I found with my own kids on. That's not, I mean, like disciplining them was just showing them how to act. Uh, character. There's definitely accessible in the civilian world, but it's just right out in front of you. In the military paradigm"
,,lcdr-barnhl,Where have you been in port?,"I have been to numerous port calls, mostly in the Western Pacific, actually, all in the Western Pacific. I've been to, uh, very sports in Japan, namely Sassa Bo, uh, when I was based out of Japan Bustan, South Korea several times. Let's hear Been to Hong Kong a couple times. Singapore been to Brisbane, Australia have been to Sydney, Australia. I've been to the Solomon Islands have been to Thailand and I've been to Guam. I believe that's all encompassing."
,,lcdr-barnhl,Where were you stationed and what was it like there?,"I've been stationed in San Diego, Japan, Fallon, Nevada and now I'm in Monterey. I was also in Pensacola for training for a time. Uh, I love being overseas. It was a great experience. Um, a lot of very, especially in Japan. I would recommend that anybody very unique culture, very unique experience. It is difficult for spouses there to find work if they said, if they desire to do so. San Diego's a fantastic location stateside. We how is very expensive. But it's sunny all the time, and the weather's great lots to do for both the member in the family if they so desire. Because the size of the Navy contingent in San Diego there's a lot of is a large support network there. Fallon Nevada was in the middle of nowhere in the high desert. Um, my, my wife would say that was her least favorite. I would say so to my job was very interesting and a lot of very interesting flying, but it is in the middle of nowhere, and it takes a special person Thio appreciate that type of thing. Nonetheless, it was a good tour, and I enjoyed it on again, a formative experience experience of my life. Monterey is Ah is itself also unique experience. That's a very upscale area that has a high cost of living. So as a za joo, you and with a family, you might have to choose to live in base housing, which, incidentally, is pretty good. But you don't won't necessarily get the chance to live off base, depending on how much money you're willing to pay."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What things should I prioritize when moving to a new location?,"when moving to a new location, you should prioritize getting to know that location. Get an idea of what the layout is figuring out where the school of good schools are for your kids, depending in determining where the best best places to rent or buy our depending on what you want to dio, depending on the type of location. Whether you render buys gonna be, uh, dependent on the cost of living. If you're in California is gonna be pretty hard to buy comfortably. Whereas if you're on the East Coast, it'll be much more is you can more easily by a place out there because the cheap prices"
,,lcdr-barnhl,When do you get to choose if you are going to live in post or off post?,"Generally, you always have the choice to live off base if you want to. Um, the types of base housing are different. So in San Diego, there are neighborhoods in San Diego that air considered military housing. There's very little actual on base housing in the particular basis around the area. That's pretty normal, I would say. Most people live out in town anyway, Um, just because of the options they have."
,,lcdr-barnhl,When do you need to find your own housing?,"regardless of if you're living on or off base, they're all. There's always an element of finding the housing where there's paperwork to fill out with the military housing folks or just finding a house to rent this not related to the military, you always have to put some effort, and no one's gonna give you a house without you doing something about it."
,,lcdr-barnhl,When should I own or rent?,I really have no opinion on whether you should own a rent their benefits to both their constant. Both yours. Got to work that out for yourself.
,,lcdr-barnhl,What types of services are easy to find vs. hard to find on a Navy base?,"on any Navy base. There's always the fleeting family support center, and this is provides information of all kinds related to perhaps housing or schooling. I could not enumerates all types of information that's on the base, but the fleet, if I would, I would recommend going to the Flea and Family Support Center. If you have any real question on any any general topic for the area, you're gonna be in if you're not. If you're not finding what you need there than military, one source dot com also has a lot of information that I can point you in the right direction."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How often will I have to move?,"since I was commissioned in 2005. I've moved seven times, but it largely depends on where you are. If you're in a large fleet concentration area, like perhaps San Diego or Norfolk, you might be able to find consecutive jobs there and not move for a significant period of time. I've known people not to stay in the same place for 12 years. I did not take that route. I wanted to move. I wanted to move to different places and I that was better for me. It just depends on where you live in what you're doing."
,,lcdr-barnhl,"Can you use outside communication on a deployment, like using the internet and email, calling by phone, and writing mail?","communication while on deployment has done via email, telephone. If you want to, though, it's a little bit more difficult. You get that there is regular access to mail and all that type of stuff. So you have regular methods of communication, thio, family, friends."
,,lcdr-barnhl,Can you drink alcohol when deployed?,"you cannot drink alcohol on U. S. Navy ships unless you spend a specific amount of time at sea, which I believe is 60 days, at which point you get two beers."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What have you seen people spend a bonus on that worked out well?,"you'll have the opportunity to get a few bonuses as you, uh, move throughout your career. I don't really have any good examples of what was a good or bad bad investment. I chose the When I got my department head bonus. I chose to put it in my retirement account almost exclusively. That's turned out pretty well, so I think that would be a good use of money blowing it all on on a, uh, on a car. I wouldn't say it's a great idea, but that someone is this this your decision? That's not mine."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What kind of lifestyle can I afford as a junior officer without going into debt?,you'll be able to afford a comfortable lifestyle. He will be. You'll be comfortably middle class as a junior officer.
,,lcdr-barnhl,How do taxes work in the military?,"taxes in the military work exactly the same as they do outside the military. The one caveat, I would say is that they're certain states that you can. Then you can claim his resident of that. You will not pay state income taxes. All you have to have done this essentially been stationed in that state. So if your in flight school, getting a driver's license in Florida will allow you to claim residents in Florida and therefore you will not be any state income tax if you are married, then the than your spouse can claim residents in that state, too. Uh, and if you're living in California after subsequently have been somewhere else, state tax paying California will generally be returned to the spouse because they the idea is that they were forced to be in California due to military service. So there's some perks that their cover other states that can't recall has your income taxes well"
,,lcdr-barnhl,When do I need to worry about retirement?,"when you first get into the military, he shouldn't really be thinking about retirement. But it's not a bad thing to think about early on. The reason I'd say you shouldn't need to be thinking about it when you first get it is because you got other things to worry about. Don't worry about getting qualified. You gotta worry about just other things related to your actual career. I think one mistake I made when I was younger, I was always looking forward to the next thing instead of really enjoying what I was doing right at the moment. While retirement is certainly a consideration, I that should be thought about well in advance. Um, you don't need to be thinking about it right away. They'll be certain milestone points in your career that will drive you to think about whether you should stay in or get out"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What benefits should take advantage of more?,"there's nothing specific to a junior officer. As faras benefits are concerned, they should take advantage of. Um, really. The most important thing about benefits is knowing what they are, knowing how they work. Um, sometimes their perks that you encounter that are that are more specific to the locale that you're residing in that that you might. There's someone obscure and you might not know about him. So, for instance, if you live in San Diego, uh, yet like to free Seaworld passes every year, little things like that, you know, they're they're especially military friendly towns. There are a lot of little things you can look for, but as faras general military benefits, there's not really anything that I would say that is not being taken revenge of budget your officers. Uh, one thing it will highlight is tthe e post 9 11 g. I. Bill, um, you will have access to that on. You will have the opportunity to transfer that over to your um to your family members. If you decide you don't need to use it on, that could be a cost savings. When there's that family goes to college, if they end up doing that. Certainly something consider, uh, any. But you need to stay on top of it. Because if the folks that should be helping you file that paperwork, drop it, like, happened to me, you'll find that, uh, you know, the transfer period is almost over, and you almost miss it."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How is travel paid for?,maybe order travel is paid for by the Navy and authorized by the Navy. The intricacies of that are for you and your command admin to discuss.
,,lcdr-barnhl,What kind of hobbies do you have time for?,"the Navy. I have a lot of hobbies. I love to read a love to run. I love to play tennis. You'll have time for all kinds of hobbies. Anything that is very, very time consuming on a regular basis might be tough to do. But generally speaking, any hobby is available to you."
,,lcdr-barnhl,Have you been in the Navy when a child of yours has been born?,All three of my Children were born while I was in the Navy.
,,lcdr-barnhl,"If you became a parent, did the Navy provide OBGYN and delivery services?","your medical coverage in the Navy covers all things like O B, G, Y n and delivery. It might not be exactly what you want, but it is provided the type of medical care you get in here. You get it from needs to be a discussion between you and your spouse, because the type of medical benefit you're paying for can't allow you to get outside. Uh, care, but it will cost you something."
,,lcdr-barnhl,"If you became a parent, what issue arose around your having your baby?","no matter where you are, there's never convenient time to have a child. It always detracts from professional life and what you want to do. Uh uh, or other things you might want to D'oh! Um, the Navy is can be a bit more stressful in that way because, uh, you all you might have a child while you're deployed. That is a huge stretcher. I have many friends. I've had that happen to you. That does not happen to me. Fortunately, I've been present for all of my kid's birthday at births and been able to be available to my wife, but during those times, But that's definitely consideration. So if you know you're gonna have a kid while you're going to be deployed, you need to make sure there's a solid support network to help your help your wife out. When, while she's at home"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What types of questions can I ask you about?,you can ask me anything. You talk about my career. We could talk about my family life in the military. We can even talk about times I consider to be failures in my career.
,,lcdr-barnhl,What happens if you attrit or a particular officer path doesn't work out?,"Well, the simplest answer to that is that if you tried it, have you tried her? You did. Your path doesn't work out. You get out of the Navy, that's a possibility. But other times you might be able to transition to a different community or you might get be given more time. Thio. Figure out howto continue down that you're originally chosen profession."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What is the advancement potential in the field? What is a typical path?,"being in the military, you will advance to some degree at first while you stay in. There are certain milestones in your career that are just natural filtering points for any community, and I should say every community is different and and how they operate in this way. Some communities have Maura Trish in earlier, which could be considered a function of the ability to just get out earlier. For instance, in the aviation community, the first time you condone decide to leave. The Navy is really after you've spent 10 years in as opposed to the service community, where you can get out and about five years. So there's some differences in that regard. But in that time frame you will at least attained the rank of lieutenant or 03 as it, as it is termed, um, moving past that it's a bit more competitive because some of it is not simply moving up in rank, but some of it is attaining greater positional authority, and it's really the positional authority positions that have the greatest filtering effect. So if you do not end up doing well enough in one positional in one position, you may not be selected for the next position. I would also say that a lot of it is based on timing. Timing is a huge factor in how you and how you promote so, uh, there. And that's something that you can can't necessarily control but in some ways is foreseeable. So, to put it succinctly, there is plenty of room for promotion and upward mobility. But you have to understand there are There are certainly checkpoints where that act as natural filtering mechanisms. Um, timing is saying, is a significant factor. But if you do not perform in those jobs, you most certainly will not promote, regardless of timing. A typical career path is, is whatever the community makes it, Mike my career path or what's the typical career path? And aviation is gonna be different when you join. When you get to the point that I'm in, the Navy will have well established, says different appreciation for different things by that time. So my career path, uh, and I I would say that I stayed on a typical career path For the majority of my tour. You do a C tour and then you go go to a short tour that is considered a production tour. So that would be It is an example that would be training pilots to move into the fleet and, in my case, specifically training play of pilots that are operating on the aircraft that was flying as opposed to initial flight training. After that, you go to a disassociated see tour, which means you aren't necessarily going to fly. If you're an aviator, you're gonna be attached to perhaps something a different unit. You might be ship's company. And then after that tour, which is a C tour, they even move into your department head to her. And the department head tour is probably the greatest has the greatest filtering effect of any position in aviation. If you do not attain a competitive number one ranking out of the department head, you will not have the chance to screen for command, which is the next positional authority. And essentially, is what all of the the personnel folks consider to be like their job to prepare every person to take command, knowing that not everyone will"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What is a good strategy for setting goals and priorities to advance?,"good strategy to advance in the military is difficult to nail down. There's not any one specific strategy, but what I would say is give yourself options. That's that's what I did. So I spent a lot of time wondering whether I want to stay in or get out. And, um, but because I wasn't sure I went ahead and did a few jobs that I knew the community was going to see is valuable. And so I kept. I kept moving up in the ranks and gaining positional authority, uh, and that I think, served me well. If you don't do those jobs, then it's very easy for the community to tell you, too, that you will not be selected for for different types of promotion. But if you do, if you end up doing those jobs, it makes it difficult for them to say no, because you have the experience that they want and you have done the things that they have asked. So it makes the decision perhaps somewhat harder. That's best. The advice I would give a CE for strategy is concerned"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What are the most important things on a resume?,"the most important things that air on your proverbial military resume. Often Ah, the jobs you've done, how well you've done in them. When I say speak of jobs, I don't mean just any random job. I really mean the jobs that your particular community considers valuable. For instance, the aviation community considers doing a production tour after your first see two are as valuable and production tour is defined as maybe, training pilots. Teoh go to the fleet in your particular aircraft. That would be like a fruit fleet replacement squadron. Let's look at that up another time. Um, but that would be a good idea, a good, good, ah example of a of a production tour and a job that the aviation community considers valuable. There are other jobs, too. That would do. They would do something similar. But if you if you choose to move off the well trod path Theun, there's less likelihood for you for your resume to be considered for consistent promotion."
,,lcdr-barnhl,Where can a person get access to a new role that will help me advance?,"so there are vast opportunities in the Navy. Um, that is that is effect. Not all opportunities were considered equal. And not all opportunities are seen as, um, truly helping the Navy in the best way they can. However, some of those opportunities air good personally for the for the one doing the job. If you you can certainly move into a different position, that might not be the best for your career, but might be the best for you. And usually that might come in the form of an application process or a recommendation from a commanding officer or something like that. But to boil it down. Really, if you want to move into a new role, a new position that you think might help you advance but is particularly competitive because it probably is, you're gonna need people backing you up. To move into that position, you're gonna need the full support of your superior officers in order to be able to be selected for that role"
,,lcdr-barnhl,Who are all the people I should talk to before making a major career choice?,"people in the Navy have an opinion on how to do things. Um, and those opinions are cover a very wide spectrum as far as who you should talk to you about what you should do in the Navy. On the obvious choice would be those who have done it before you. So those folks being your superiors, your commanding officers and your executive officer now, typically, in any command, your executive officer is gonna be the one that's gonna kind of facilitate you moving on to your next job. And And he will make recommendations to the commanding officer to suggest for him to suggest, uh, where you should go. If you want a formal discussion on on things like this, you can talk with your detailer Who is whose Establishing Millington, Tennessee. If you go there a website, you'll no doubt find a good contact email for those folks. But surely speaking, if you're trying to decide what to do with your career, you should get a wide range of opinions. You should talk to people that are both in and outside your community. You should talk to people that were inside your community but then decided to leave Deviate for the typical career path, and you can get an idea of how their experience vary from those who stayed on the career path. Um, I've given plenty of advice to people on on eye on things like this. And what I think is important to remember is that no career path is is the same. They're similar, but they were never the same. So what work for somebody won't necessarily work for you?"
,,lcdr-barnhl,Who gave you the best advice about your career?,"The person that gave me the best advice about my career was a department head I had during my first year tour. We were having a discussion in the wardroom before a flight, and we started talking about what might what it might want to do after this. And this was very early on in my jail, too, and I didn't really think anything of it basically told him like, You know, if things work out and I get to my next job, then I get to do a production tour or a good job, then that's great. If I don't, then that's fine, too. So we went ahead and had the flight. And then the next day I sat down with him. We just happened to sit down, he said. He told me, Uh, Dave, What you should dio is always regard. So what? You want to dio always say that you're interested in the career path? Don't give any indication that you're not on. I think that kind of served me well cause you should still keep your cards close because people have to make decisions about where you're gonna go. And if you show a disinterest, then they will take that to heart when comparing it to someone else who might show a very vigorous interest into remaining on the career path. So you need to think about bio means. Consider the alternatives. But don't take away the option to remain on the career path because once you're off it, it's very, very difficult to get back on."
,,lcdr-barnhl,In what ways would your career have benefited from better advice?,"The nature of my personality lends itself to doing things that are approved of by any community. I'd say so not sure my career path would have changed. One thing I would have wanted to know, though, is to be a bit more is to have a bit more information on the alternatives going off the career path because there's some very good ones on and they're not. They're not necessarily. They're not bad, in fact, a very good. But they're just probably good in a more personal way for your own personal gain. And it was always there's always, you know, when when these these types of options were discussed, they they were always given with the caveat, Will This is bad for your career or something like that. So I was always reticent to even consider them. But looking back, there are some very interesting opportunities that I think would have been very beneficial. Um, now my have lights. If I wasn't as worried about staying on the career path"
,,lcdr-barnhl,How can I tell who I can really rely on?,"like any profession, it's difficult to really determine what piers or superiors or subordinates you can you can rely on. But as you get more exposure to him to those folks, you'll learn what they're like and what they consider important and how and whether they'll help you get out. It may be a difficult situation. Um, I would say there's any particular thing that you would would see automatically, but more sustained performance type idea, as in, if you if you see someone just arrived to the squadron and you know they end up being very good anticipating problems, they're very good at looking ahead and ensuring that they're not just thinking about the problem immediately in front of them, but kind of looking out and predicting how that how our reaction to that problem will affect us in the long run. If that type of that type of personality entered your enters your world, then I think you can say those folks can help you out. The long run a SZ for superiors are concerned superiors that are consistently asking you how you're doing and what you're interested in, and you aren't just strictly on a professed staying on a professional level, but you kind of move into the personal level. To some extent, Um, in my experience, that has been an indicator of whether I can trust them and rely on them. Help me out in my best interest, and I think that has served me well."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What advice did you listen to from others that helped you advance?,"The advice that I have received from from peers, superiors and subordinates that has really helped me move forward is first and foremost. Take care of your people if you show an interest in your people than that resonates in different parts of the job, and people see that and you'll get a big you get a boost because because people talk about you being a pretty good officer, it doesn't matter if you're demanding. It doesn't matter if you're hard nosed and persistent. If you're helping people, they end up respecting you because maybe even because of those things, maybe we respect him or because of those things. They know what to expect from you, and they can consider you a reliable person, a reliable officer."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What advice did people tell you that you wished you had heeded?,"the advice that I wish I had listened more to or I wouldn't exactly say it's advice that would listen more to it Beam or things that would have thought about a bit more and those those would have been, Maybe not being so worried about, uh, where my career trajectory would be if I decided not to take specific jobs and decided to do something that was a bit more may be interesting or beneficial to me. Personally. I've had a good career and I've enjoyed what I've done. But there's some things that I passed up that I wish I had. Not even if it was just applying for those things on DDE had the option to take him. Uh, I think that's that would have been something I would have take more, take more advantage of"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What question have I not asked you that I should have asked you?,"you've asked plenty of good questions. I think one thing you could consider asking whether to me or to another to another superior, perhaps, is. You know what? Ah, how do I stay organized and keep keep? Ah, solid record on my officer accomplishments throughout my career. So one big interaction you will have is with the Navy Personnel Command. And there's a nine idea out there that they have all the information about you in some vault Weatherby a digital or otherwise. But they screw up. They miss. Thinks they do not get fit reps. They do not have awards. It's very important for you to keep track of your accomplishments so that if they somehow get lost, you can quickly produce them in order to fill out your record. Because keep in mind when you're moving through your career and these different screen boards air, deciding if you're gonna move up would be it positionally or through just simple rank promotion. If they see a discrepancy in your record, that's all they have to go on. They don't have any real personal input from you about what you did, and those decisions will be made very quickly as in a matter of seconds, oftentimes. So be responsible for your record. Keep a good handle on it in the case that something comes up later."
,,lcdr-barnhl,Should I go to college now or after serving?,"the choice to go to college is a total personal one. I am of the opinion on this is my own personal opinion that having some world experience benefits you in college. Um, and there's also one might also say that you seeing because you got to keep in mind you will be. If you don't go to college, you're gonna be in the enlisted ranks. One might say that seeing the enlisted side of things prior to becoming an officer is actually a very good experience on dhe valuable. And I think that's true, generally speaking. But, you know, it's that is still a very personal decision. Some people are right for college as soon as they get out of high school. Other times, you know, they need the world experience to gain some maturity, the maturity which is valuable in their practicalities of that. If you're not mature and you waste time in college, then you're gonna be we're gonna be wasting money. But you're also just wasting time and gaining Cem otherwise good experience that you might otherwise have gotten, so there's no really good answer that it depends on the person. But if you're ambivalent about going to college, then perhaps you you should, and you want to serve the military or serve in the military. Perhaps you should serve first, and then you can decide later to go to college and get a degree that way. And if you want to from there and there are there are programs to do this, you can go. The Navy can send you to college in order to become on officer on the backside. If not, you have the 9 11 g i bill, which can pay for your college after you after you've served."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What range of tasks and opportunities does this field present to allow me to grow?,"the spectrum of tasks and skills and missions that you will experience an aviation field are are almost infinite. I could not enumerated every single one that will help you grow as a person and an officer. But generally speaking, the interaction with people and how you deal with it helps you learn a lot about yourself, helps you hone your leadership skills, as you might imagine. And that's one of the best things about being in the military. You really learn a lot about yourself when you're making decisions. If you're an introspective person and think about what you did and you're willing to learn from your mistakes, your interactions with people can certainly show that on. That's one of the biggest things I'd say That's fairly generic, and I think that is a cross community of borders. But it's still true nonetheless. Generally speaking, also, you know, being in the Navy, you're going to see a lot of things, a lot of things that you would never see if you stayed in a private or civilian sector. It gives you perspective on the world, gives you perspective on people. It will help you encounter people that you otherwise wouldn't have encountered, and he will. You will be generally a better person for those experience experiences"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What leaders do you look up to for guidance?,"I have a few mentors that I've looked up to over the over the past several years. Generally, they have been former commanding officers or something like that. Um, and that's pretty normal. Also former department heads that I gained a lot of what I think valuable leadership skills from, um, there that I think you'll as you move through your career. You will see that, too. But it is important, too. Perhaps attach yourself to some folks and you keep in contact with them. Let him know what you doing periodically see how they're doing. I've asked for several recommendations from folks that have been my superiors that have been, if you'd benefited me in the law in the long run, you don't really want to close doors on your superiors because you never know where they're gonna end up, and sometimes they're positional authority. I can help you get jobs. You might otherwise have more difficulty getting"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What opportunity would I have to change careers/fields?,"so the opportunity to do transfer between communities or if or even get out of the Navy. Her vast, usually in order to get out of the Navy is based on a a timeline which you agreed upon upon entering or might be based on a sea of bonus or son education and educational opportunity that you said that you wanted to take. And then you have to pay some time back. But, uh, when you say changing careers, I'm thinking maybe you you want to get out of the Navy. But inside the Navy, if you want to transfer different to different community, those opportunities exist. What I will say is that the further Ugo in one community, the more difficult it may be to transfer out of it because you have to think in terms of how the folks that the personnel command see you, they're seeing you a CZ as a as a tool as a CZ in a utilitarian type of mode, um, they need to use you. And if they let you transfer over, then they've lost that tool that they've got. They might otherwise think they've had all turn also along with that, like the further you go in the career, the longer you're in, especially the closer you are to retirement. If you do decide to stay in that long, they might ask, Why would we let this person transferred to a new field? If he's just going to get out and say 45 years, that could be one consideration. However, with all that said, there plenty of opportunities to transfer, you can always try and transfer. There are repercussions. Perhaps, as in you know, if someone knows that you want to move to a different field, that might suggest to them that you're not interested in continuing along a typical career path in the field, you're already in S O that might sacrifice some of your career potential if you end up not getting selected for that other other position."
,,lcdr-barnhl,Who gave you the best advice about being a better leader?,"They're different variations of advice. People give you some ex specifically based on your career. Other times, it's just how to better be a better leader. One of the better pieces of advice I I got about being a better leader who came during a, uh, a fitness report debrief that I had with the superior. I was, uh I did done a good job, and he was doing his job by giving me some feedback on some things I could work on. Uh, I'm naturally the type of person who is has a very stoic face. And you don't really know if I'm happier, sad unless I'm very overt about it. And he gave me a word of caution that you walking around like that as a leader can lead to uncertainty and most your subordinates. How you're really doing it might make you less approachable. And that's what you don't want. You want people to be able to come to you and feel like they can come to you and talk to you and ask you questions and let you know what the problems are both professional and personal. Um, so while that might be a small thing What Well you can take that to mean is simply that you take a look at how you're carrying yourself. Take a look at the things that you are doing that might dissuade people from interacting with you. Because there's a leader you need those interactions. You are not alone in this decision making process. You need people's advice, you need people's input, and you want people feel comfortable giving that input, even if you disagree with him."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How can I request to work in a certain area or field?,"If you're already established in a particular community, the way toe move across to a different community or transition its first. You got to talk to your commanding officer, and then there will likely be an application process of some sort. You need the commanding officers approval to be able to move across field. If that he does not support you, then you will not. So it's very important for you to establish that first. The second is generally a paperwork drill, but the application and perhaps other recommendations are good to have if you want to do that."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How much value does your organization put on education and training?,"Traditionally, aviation does not put a huge value on education for the very fact that it's a compressed timeline almost throughout your career. There a few opportunities just to go to school. So if you want to go to school, you have to do it on your time or wait to until you reach in kind of a prescribed period of time, usually at your department. Head to her to go toe to go to school. If that's if that's the case. If you do, wait until then until after your department or you're likely going to G o Thio uh, the Naval War College, which is a good school there. You just don't won't necessarily have as much choice on what you what you focus on, Um, and that's largely driven by the fact that they the the community managers, wants you to have, ah, better education. But they can't let you leave the community for too long, and that's a one year program. This is opposed to going to an outside university or press a naval postgraduate school, which has a variety of focuses, but it takes a bit more time to typically finish finish those finish those programs alternately get a graduate education on your own time, usually during a short tour, and sometimes your commands will be flexible. Thio missing work for that type of thing. But generally speaking, education and aviation is not not necessarily highly sought after."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How do the educational benefits of the military work?,"so there are a lot of different educational benefits in the Navy, and I would advise anybody to use those benefits to pay for whatever schooling you end up using. So first off, you have to remember their institutions in the Navy that will give you graduate credit, those being like the Naval War College or the Naval Postgraduate School. And as far as the Naval Postgraduate School is concerned, you can often times do a distance learning degree, and all of this is paid for. But you will typically oh, sometime after the completion of the program. Alternatively, you could wait till your wait till a short tour to get a degree from a civilian institution and perhaps use your post 9 11 g I bill to pay for it. If you don't do that and you get an education, perhaps the Navy paid for a different way. You can transfer the post 9 11 g. I bill benefits to your to your family members, and that is a very valuable asset and benefit that I would advise anybody to take advantage of. But if you're gonna do that, I would advise to do it early because they do attack on some extra time for you in order to transfer those benefits. However, if you already have a service commitment, that time will run concurrently. From what? You're what you're already serving. So it's not tacked onto the end of that service commitment. So keep that. Keep that in mind. In order to figure out how to transfer those benefits, you need to talk with your command at admin or specifically your ah, career counselor that should be established in your command."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How will my experience transfer to civilian jobs outside of the Navy?,"it's hard to say exactly how in the hell military service transfers, Um, sometimes it does very nicely, Uh, and but other times not so much, I think people value the leadership skills you get for sure. But you gotta keep in mind just because you fly aircraft like me. That doesn't automatically mean people value flying aircraft they probably Valium or the fact that you've managed people and lead people in difficult situations. So if there's anything that really transfers to civilian life, that's it. But you also have to keep in mind and keep in mind. I am still in the Navy, and I'm not in this in civilian life. Uh, the way you interact with people subordinate specifically in the military is probably different than how you interact with them in civilian life, right? Probably less direct. And the demanding nature of the Navy doesn't transfer terribly well to civilian life. I would think"
,,lcdr-barnhl,Who has influenced you the most?,"the people that have influenced me the most. Generally, my peers, I've had some really good superior mentors. But there are two individuals specifically that I worked with is a department head that I gained valuable insights from. I think you will find that your peers give you the greatest insights on to you and how you should lead, because you get to observe how they're going to do it, and then you can. If you're willing and humble enough, you can implement their techniques into yours. And if those were good, you can just become what you could be a much better leader than you might already be. Three important thing about that is to be humble and observe and listen and realize that you don't have all the answers on the people around you, even if they're your peers. And even if their subordinates can show you how to lead people in the military"
,,lcdr-barnhl,Tell me about a mentor that you have or had. How did that person positively influence your academic decisions?,"the best leader I've ever had. A deadly calm. A mentor is was a a commander who was my boss when I was in Japan for the second time. He was not gonna be a commanding officer, but he had the rank of 05 And he had a very easy going attitude towards everything journal professionally. And it just kind of showed that you did not have to be hard nosed about everything. You did not have to be overly demanding about everything in order to do a good job. And he did a fantastic job. He made the working environment very good, enjoyable even. And the people in the working of environment. While we didn't always agree, we got along very well, I think, largely because of his leadership"
,,lcdr-barnhl,Who is a person that you considered as a role model early in your life? How and why does this person impact your life?,"I think I always considered my family my main role models. I was kind of held, held my father in high esteem. I wanted to be very much like him as faras. Individuals that were perhaps higher positions or anything like that never really thought of them as role models, particularly that I can recall. But the one ones that have been consistent have been the people that I've known teachers, parents, those types of folks."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How and why does this person impact your life?,"Oh, my. My parental role models obviously impacted me the most because they were consistent and always there, and they demanded a lot for me. Um, my the other role models that I had, whether they were coaches or teachers or anything like that, you know, they they certainly contributed significantly to my, uh, who I am. They supported me, and we're willing thio support my goals when I was young. Um, they say they impacted me numerous ways from making me who I am today. Whether I whether looking back, I ended up agreeing with them or not, I still appreciate the types of things they taught me. An impacted me through my life. You gotta remember you don't become who you are by yourself. You're there are tons of people that have an impact you, even if it's like small micro impacts. So you've got to give those folks credit and showing you how to be a hate contributing human being"
,,lcdr-barnhl,How can you tell if someone will be a good mentor?,"It's not always easy to tell if someone's gonna be a good mentor, But one way you can see it is if they are willing to interact with you and ask you questions not just professional but personal to seeing how you doing, how your family's doing, what your aspirations in different, different things like that."
,,lcdr-barnhl,"If I don't have a mentor, how can I find good one?","There's not always a guarantee that you're gonna find a good mentor. There are people that I thought would be good mentors for me that didn't turn out. So not because they would have been bad. But we just never established a report. But I think that's the key. If you want to have some one be your mentor than you need to engage them, he cannot wait for them to engage you. Otherwise you're probably gonna miss out."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What is your plan to reach your career/life goal?,"Well, some things you have to remember about reaching your life goals is that timing is a huge aspect of it. Um, and I do know I also don't think, uh, a goal has to be a particular path because they're gonna be demands on your life that you can't control, especially being in the military. So, for instance, if you want to get a higher education, say beyond a master's degree and you're still in the military, you have military responsibilities that you have to fulfill, probably before you can attain that goal. Now, there are certain ways you might be able to to get closer to that goal in the military. But I think that largely revolves around attaching yourself to people that are associated with haggle, asking people questions, making yourself known, making you're making it known that you're interested in that type of thing. Um, that's probably the best advice I can really give you right now."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What happens when you separate from the military?,"I haven't separated from the military, so I don't entirely know. But there is a process of getting getting out. There's various transition assistance programs that you have to attend. Um, and you know, you have to do various medical physicals and and stuff like that. Uh, but I haven't researched in depth of what? That what that entails, but it shouldn't be too hard to figure out."
,,lcdr-barnhl,"How important is it to have the right training, degree or experience?","So one thing to consider about your prior experience in the military experience prior to the military is that they intentionally make these jobs, generally speaking, available to everybody of all types. So I was a history major, and I became a pilot. You wouldn't necessarily say that. There's ah, uh, a relationship to those things. There are plenty of people that air engineers, for instance, that our pilots, but there are plenty of people that are not. So you see, as far as the journal warfare communities are concerned, you can. You can gain disqualifications without having what would be considered the right degree or training. Prior to that. For more specialized type things you might need need a background in whatever you want to do. But nothing particularly comes to mind is what what those might be. Educational opportunities that air outside the Navy say, For instance, you know political military masters, which could take you to civility, civilian institution like Stanford, Harvard, Princeton or anything like that That might require a degree that is specific to that type of study. I'm sure there are others, too, but that's the best example and come up with"
,,lcdr-barnhl,What do you believe will be the most important factors that will shape your future?,"I think the most important things that will shape my future of what is what people think of me. Was I good, Officer? Uh, did I help people out on? Was that perceived across ranks? But from subordinates to superiors? If you're good at that, then you are. You gain. Ah, lot of a lot of fans. Um, you know, you can think about Dale Carnegie in his book How to win Friends and influence people. Oftentimes, if you're just a good person friendly and you engage people at their level, that will take you a long way to getting where you want to go. Might not take you all the way there. There are other things you definitely have to do. But if you have people rooting for you, uh, that's oftentimes half the battle."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How do you continue to improve your skills during your career?,"you'll consistently have opportunity to hone your skills throughout your career. The Navy is is one big continuing education continuum. Um, in the aviation community, you will have to fly all the time for at least a lot, which requires you to maintain your skills in that respect. But as far as leadership is concerned, you know leadership is very nebulous concept. In some ways, uh, the best way to hone your skills and continuing to hone your skills is to is to engage people that have that have been there before that have done those things before. You can do this by talking directly to them, and I'm speaking mainly like your your superiors, perhaps, but you can also read, read, read books by people who have been in those been those types of positions before and gain their leadership experience. That's one thing that is not explicit in the Navy and that you know, how do you develop leadership skills? Well, oftentimes will say, Well, it's an art, not a science, so that's that requires just basically exposure to different types of way of doing things to make those skills better"
,,lcdr-barnhl,How often have you been presented with challenging new skills to learn?,"Throughout my career, I've always had to learn new skills. Whether it was attaining a new qualification or flying a new aircraft, it's pretty much consistent. And if you're not getting better something or if they're new new skills to attain, then you're stagnating and you're probably not gonna progress too far and what you're in, what in your chosen career path."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How much of your free time do you spend learning new tasks?,"like any job, you have to spend some of your free time learning how to do new things. It's inevitable. If you only rely on the time that's at work. It's just you're never gonna be as good as you could be. And oftentimes you might even fail after. That's kind of like school. You have to take home work home, and you have to practice in order to get better. What you're doing this aviation is, is a similar thing there plenty of times where I've had to take work home with me to study or stay late at the office in order to study because I couldn't take it home."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What are you doing daily to ensure your growth and development continues?,"While I think you have to be intentional about ensuring that you're growing and developing, you don't have to. You don't necessarily have to seek a moment each day to do it. A lot of times exposure you get at work in the military is enough to continue your development. But what you need to d'oh! I really do feel like this is in need. You have to be humble and you have to be introspective and think about how you're doing things. And if you see a better way of doing it than adopt that, you know there's if they're only a few situations in life where you can plagiarize and this is definitely one of them, it might work for you. It might not, but he should at least be humble enough to realize that there are better way things, better ways of doing things and that it is okay for you to adopt those ways, even if it feels a little unnatural."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How often do you receive recognition and advancement for contributions?,"One thing about the officer corps is that recognition certainly comes, but it usually comes, say, at the end of the tour, basically to say thank you for your service well done and good luck in your future career endeavors. You'll see a lot more recognition in the A list ranks, which is more appropriate, in my opinion, um, I would say the recognition that you receive comes more from how the years your subordinates interact with you during your time at your whatever duty station you're at. That's the recognition that it was always valued to meet one. I could tell you one of the most valuable pieces of recognition, and it was implicit. It wasn't direct that I received was when one of my subordinates asked for a recommendation. Uh, for test pilot school, I was I mean, I was I was just a few months ago that he asked for this and he was kind of down because he didn't get the ranking, that he wanted it the squatter. But he and he wasn't too excited about where he was going to go next. So he decided to apply to something different. I happily gave him a recommendation because he deserved it, and it was awesome to see that he succeeded in getting what he wanted and just simply be a part of that, that that was one of the most rewarding experiences that I've had in the Navy. And while that's not exactly recognition, it definitely felt like I contributed to something. I contributed to someone's career aspirations. Do not think that Lieutenant Commander's recommendation had a lot to do with it. He had a lot of other people supporting him in that, but it was nice to be a part of, and he and the and appreciated my efforts."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What are the ribbons/awards that you've gotten?,"eso. I've received several words through my time in the Navy. In my opinion, a lot of it's just, you know, I I I did my job and they were kind enough to give me an award after the fact. Eso I've gotten a number of Navy achievement medals have gotten some Navy commendation medals and some of the ribbons that represent I'm going to see your being part of a humanitarian assistance as an officer. Usually you have to do something pretty significant to get a a specific action award. Most of what you would receive is based on your sustained performance at any particular command."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What is the ratio of girls and guys on a ship?,"I don't know the exact ratio of females to males, but at the academy it was about 16%. And I think journalists about maybe 20% you can do some research online and then I'll give you a pretty good answer."
,,lcdr-barnhl,Can you date while on a ship?,"I do not recommend dating while you're on a ship. It is generally frowned upon because superiors air typically worried about what you call good order and discipline. You definitely can't share a room. Oh, or anything like that. However, you know, relationships develop if you're going. If that's going to happen, then you need to save it for a poor call."
,,lcdr-barnhl,Describe any instances of sexual impropriety in your workplace and the consequences.,"So when I was a department head, there was some, uh, at least whispers of, perhaps sexual harassment going on in one of the shops. My commanding officer and executive officer took swift action on that on insured that that those who were responsible were dealt with appropriately. And that's the way it should have been. Hiding anything like that is a bad idea. It's bad for the people involved, and certainly bad for the command, and if it is perceived it is being hidden, things will only get worse."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How much does sexual misconduct affect a team compared to other bad behaviors?,"sexual misconduct is highlighted because it has not been perhaps appropriately dealt with in the recent past, and that and that's that's a good thing, However, uh, crimes that are comparable to sexual misconduct or seen Justus Justus bad. They just don't necessarily get the same same coverage that you might see with sexual misconduct. So I'd say they were on the same playing field. It's just not It's not, as is highlighted."
,,lcdr-barnhl,Is sexual harassment common? What kinds?,"I believe sexual harassment is common in the Navy. I think that And this is my opinion, that in a in a male dominated organization, the way men speak to one another, uh, ends up being the norm doesn't make it right. But it does become kind of the norm. And it can make. I can imagine it can make females feel a bit more uncomfortable. Um, so it is important, uh, for men to think about how they're speaking, whether they're in the presence of females or not, it doesn't really matter."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What other kinds of harrassment do you see?,"one thing about the about the Navy, is it? I believe it represents a demographic. It's a representative demographic of our society, so you'll usually see sexual harassment in the enlisted ranks when you see it, Um, see what she will. I think education has a lot to play in. Education. Perspective has a lot of playing how we interact with in our genders. Um, and I think that ends up. That's one reason why you Seymour sexual harassment, the enlisted ranks than the junior officer or your officer ranks. Asshole. That obviously doesn't mean that sexual harassment is absent in the officer ranks. It is definitely there. I just think it's less so than in the and the enlisted ranks."
,,lcdr-barnhl,"What situations have a higher risk for harrassment or sexual assault? (e.g., duty cycles, locations, events)","I wouldn't say there's a particular situation. What I would say is there specific cultures that can lead to this? The If the command culture is not specifically highlighting the the, uh, sexual harassment and the fact that will not be accepted, then I think you will likely it will be more likelihood of it happening in a particular command."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What kinds of behaviors do you ban that are sometimes allowed in the Navy?,"like any military organization, there's a certain level of machines. No, that is present. And that is that to me comes from the male dominated nature of the of the organization. I don't think there's anything wrong with with machismo and general, but it can certainly be taken to taken too far. It can lead to some immature it ease that are not necessary. And generally speaking, I don't really like that too much."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How do I deal with generational differences in views of appropriate boundaries?,"so different generations have different views of what's appropriate, Uh, but I but that's really a perception. I think if you treat people with respect, then then you don't have to worry about the difference in views of what's appropriate or not. You know, things you learned early in life. Keep your hands to yourself. Talk to people as if you were talking to your mother. All those types of ideas you could be. You don't need to worry about how the generational, uh, of what's appropriate. Cross generational across generations if you just but exhibit respect for that individual. Now, some things you can't help some people are. Some people are sensitive to how you interact with them. Some people do not respond well to the directness that is inherent in the military, and you do need you may need to soften that a little bit. That's generally my advice on that"
,,lcdr-barnhl,"How do you motivate sailors to act appropriately, if they think their behavior is harmless?","sometimes, even though someone thinks what they have, what they're doing is harmless. It can have an impact, a negative impact. Um, as an officer, you have to set the standard. You have to let them know what is appropriate and that any deviation from that is what will not be tolerated. Uh, it sounds quite draconian, but that is the reality of this situation. You can talk to them in a reason way and let them know why you think the way you think. But they continue to deviate from that. Then you might have to take action and, uh, and be a bit more, um, disciplined in your response."
,,lcdr-barnhl,"When you are in charge, what are the boundaries that you set for sailors? (e.g., touching, sharing rooms offbase)","days, So you're not gonna be over control everybody's actions all the time, But you can let them know what the boundaries are. The best way to do that. Just be clear. You can't cover every situation. But if you are clear on what you expect from people, um, those boundaries will naturally be in place if you're if you're concerned about people of different rakes cohabitating off base. Uh, I'm not sure there's something that you can do about that If they're already doing it, um, you can have what I would say is you want to try to deal with it at the lowest level possible. A lot of times that's engaging the senior list of leadership toe. Let them know what's going on and see if they can handle it, because oftentimes that's enough. And if you're going in establishing these boundaries, you need tohave your non commissioned officers on board and agreeing with you in order to make that case"
,,lcdr-barnhl,When is a formal report necessary for a harrassment or sexual assault claim.,"their specific Navy policy governing when a formal and informal report are necessary for a sexual assault claim. I would recommend you take a look at that documentation. I can't remember the document number, but you can easily look it up and and find it there specific nuances to each of those situations. Um, but I wouldn't I'm not going to speak to them directly right now."
,,lcdr-barnhl,"In terms of inappropriate sexual behavior, when should you handle it yourself versus get an expert?","I do not think there's ever a time where you should simply handle it yourself. Uh, let me let me start that over. I do not. If sexual, if inappropriate sexual behavior is occurring in your unit, there's never a time you should simply handle it yourself. Uh, now there's there might be a difference in perception. What that is, whether it's two of your sailors, that air that have established a relationship, or are we talking about sexual assault? Obviously, there's a difference there, but if these things it is deemed inappropriate, it needs to be elevated, Um, in order to in order for folks in order for it to be handled appropriately."
,,lcdr-barnhl,Who is the first things to do if someone tells you about a sexual assault?,"The first thing you do if someone tells you about a sexual assault, especially if it happens to them, is to see if those that person needs any sort of medical attention. There's there are specific people that are designated Thio help sexual assault victims, and they should be engaged in incorporated in the process. From what goes on from there, you can reference the sexual assault directives. They're in Navy policy."
,,lcdr-barnhl,"What should you do if someone has been assaulted or harrassed, but leadership isn't following up?","If your seniors do not take action for a sexual assault claim, then you have a problem with your leadership. For one, there are people outside of the chain command chain of command that you can engage. Uh, I would be very careful and how you do it. Then that's where I'm gonna leave that. But it is inappropriate for seniors to not take a sexual assault claims seriously. Uh, and that would that's that would be abnormal if they did not."
,,lcdr-barnhl,"What are the roles of different resources to respond to sexual assault? (e.g., chaplain, sapro)","Fortunately, I've never been party to a sexual assault case or claim. Um, I'm really happy that I've never had to deal with that. So I do not know how exactly these representatives work, but I know that A they exist on B. They do a lot of good work to help people who have sexual assault claims, and they should be engaged to as much of the extent as the victim wants them to be part of the situation. As a leader, you need to If you are part of this, you need to provide the victim with the various resource is men contact information for these people."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What are signs you should look out for that might mean there is discrimination after a disagreement/harrassment?,"Sometimes the signs of of of discrimination are pretty apparent. Sometimes it's just you can hear it in the normal office talk in your shops. I've been fortunate enough to be in places where that has been very abnormal. People generally got along, and you do not see ingrained discrimination in the culture of the places I've been. But it does exist s so as far as things that give an indication. Usually you'll you'll hear something coming up from the enlisted ranks on that is filtered through your non commissioned officers. If you haven't been able to tell yet, the noncommissioned officer is your liaison with the enlisted ranks, and you should maintain a good relationship with them because they can give you some pretty good insight of what's happening in those ranks."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What do you do to avoid bias when evaluating sailors?,"the easiest way to avoid biases just to evaluate a person on on their accomplishments. Um, that's that's the first and foremost the best way. I think we're all inherently biased in some way, shape or form, and we can't avoid it completely. But there's no I've ever really come across a situation that I felt when I was immediately giving someone, ah, benefit of doubt because of a specific aspect of their character, or perhaps a race or something like that that I did not consider for somebody else. What I hope I've done is that I've considered what they've done as the primary reason I've told them they've done well or have not."
,,lcdr-barnhl,Are you happy with your job?,"Yes, I'm happy overall with my job."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How can your work change the world?,I don't know if my work can change the world. I think I could be part of something that might be ableto to affect the world. I don't know that it can change it.
,,lcdr-barnhl,What is the most important lesson about life you have learned?,"The most important lesson about life that I've learned is that I don't know everything, and I've got a lot to learn."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What makes you proud?,"I'm proud that I've been able to help people get to places they wanted to go. I'm proud that I've been able to take care of people. Uh, that's given me the group most satisfaction since being in the military."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How and where do you find inspiration?,"I find inspiration from my peers and subordinates. When I see someone do something well or they achieve something that they have been working towards, that's inspiring to me."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What keeps you up at night?,"things that keep me up at night are probably pretty trivial in the long run. Uh, it's more things that I need thio need to get done or that I think are important that I haven't completed yet. I can't say, in the words of General Mattis, that nothing keeps me up at night. But, you know, usually it's fairly trivial things."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What has been your greatest success?,my greatest success has been simply helping people where I have been able to get to where they need to get to.
,,lcdr-barnhl,How do you define success?,"I define success as helping people gets to where they deserve to get to, and I mean that in a positive way."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How should you respond to a death on the ship?,"you should respond to death in your unit by being respectful about it. If there is an investigation going on about how it happened, then you need to keep your mouth shut of and and let the investigation take its course before you start really talking about anything."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How should you respond to a suicide on the ship?,"it's a suicide occurs in your unit. You should be respectful of the person and family involved. You shouldn't assume anything about the person in the long term. I think that a command should, uh, do its own introspection to determine how they could have helped the person anymore than they already had."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What resources are most effective to help sailors deal with grief or loss?,"There are a lot of programs to help sailors deal with grief or loss. But I think really the most effective one are the people around that sailor. I said If a sailor feels isolated, that can oftentimes just exacerbate the feelings of of loss or grief. But if they know that there's someone around for support, then that can go a long way to helping them. My wife, not in the Navy, but she was very instrumental in helping another woman get through a miscarriage, and it wasn't because she was trying to do everything for the woman or solve her problems. She was simply there. So in my opinion, the very fact that my wife was there and available to that woman went a long way to helping the woman deal with a very difficult and grief stricken process."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How should you handle a sailor who is less effective at their duties due to grief?,"if a sailor is being affected by their grief on their duties. Number one, this shouldn't. If you have known about this situation, as in the event that is causing the grief before anything happens, you should anticipate that this could be a problem. Talk with urine CEOs and see what plan of action is appropriate for that person. Second, and is just in general be sensitive to that person's mentality. They're going through something that you perhaps cannot grasp. Uh, so it's important that you have enough sensitivity to realize that."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How should you respond to someone who has thoughts of suicide?,"but an officer should respond to anyone who has thoughts of suicide by the way any normal person would be available. Be a friend, see if you can help help them get help. As I've said before, if you sometimes simply being there is enough to dissuade someone from carrying out a suicidal act."
,,lcdr-barnhl,Have you known someone who died in the Navy? (or seriously injured?),I have known people who have died in the Navy.
,,lcdr-barnhl,How you known someone who committed suicide in the Navy?,I have not personally known someone who's committed suicide since I've been in the service.
,,lcdr-barnhl,"What risk factors should you look out for, to identify a real suicide risk from person having a bad day or rough patch?","It's very difficult to discern true suicidal behavior versus just having a difficult period of time. But what I would say is that if someone is consistently upset or seems down, they should be engaged. It doesn't matter if you think they're suicidal or not, that that is just a proper human thing to do."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What options do you have to work with a sailor who is sick frequently or for longer periods?,"Usually, if you have a sailor who's sick for long periods of time or have something else going on, you'll have other. Resource is it will come up to the command level and they'll decide what to do with that particular sailor. As a junior officer, it's more important for you simply to know about it and elevated, if necessarily."
,,lcdr-barnhl,How can you help encourage people with suicidal thoughts to talk about it with others?,"suicidal thoughts are difficult to understand if you're not, if you've not been in that situation and I have not personally, so I can't speak to it exactly. But again, just being there and listening to them and encouraging that person to perhaps try and get some help could go a long way."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What should you do if someone might be a suicide risk and you know they have easy access to guns or other weapons?,"if you have a sailor who is a suicide risk and has access to weapons that you and you're afraid they will hurt themselves with those weapons and you need to engage your command and specifically engage your non commissioned officers because what you'll learn is that your non commissioned officers have, ah, pulse on how things are working in the list ranks and have a pretty good handle on the personal lives of their sailors. They're tremendous resource on the Maybe the starting point would be to engage them and see what what advice they have."
,,lcdr-barnhl,When should you get Navy resources involved with a risk of suicide?,"If you perceive that there is a real suicide risk, you should get the Navy assets. Um, maybe suicide assets involved right away. They're professionals that that have dealt with suicide for a long time, and it probably better equipped than you to to deal with it. If you're dealing with something this heavy by yourself, then then you're probably not doing it right."
,,lcdr-barnhl,When is a formal report necessary for a possible suicide risk?,"So, to my recollection, there's no formal report if there is a perceived suicide risk, because that's somewhat subjective. Um, if they're, if someone has tried to commit suicide, then perhaps there is. But I would recommend you take a look at Navy directives Thio figure out when that is."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What organizations were most helpful to you in your career?,"one of the best organizations, informal organizations that has been a help to my family has been the military, various military spouse clubs that have been resident at my my commands. Um, they provide a lot of heads up on what's going on in the community before you get there. They provide support, your family when when you're deployed on in general, sometimes they have a bad name for whatever reason, but we've only had generally good experiences with those. Additionally, you have what's called the family readiness group FRG and might go by different names. The ideas. It's a group associated with a command that's willing to that that supports the sailors while our the sailors families while the sailors might be deployed."
,,lcdr-barnhl,What Big Navy resources should I rely most on and why?,"the resource is your rely on their provided by the navy, uh, are broad spectrum. Uh, there's not one that's necessarily better than another. But what I would say is that if you have a general question about the Navy, whether you're talking about military pay or you're talking about B H in a location where you're trying to get access to, you know, maybe healthcare type questions military One source, which is not directly part of the big Navy apparatus, usually kind of collates an aggregate. This information usually ends up being a one stop shop for at least pointing you in the right direction of where you need to go for for this type of thing. Usually we need as a jail you're not exactly looking for big Navy. Resource is, it just doesn't happen too much. But there that's a good website to go to. A few if you need it"
