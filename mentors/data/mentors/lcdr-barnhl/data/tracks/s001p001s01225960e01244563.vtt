00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.430
the junior officer is an interesting animal, especially eight years. They're

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:12.010
 way over, confident. All of us are way overconfident, and probably

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:17.590
 it's because we have a romanticized view of flying aircraft. The

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.170
 junior officer is one of the most ubiquitous officers in any type

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.750
 of unit, so they're going to be everywhere all the time. As faras delegation

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.330
 is concerned, the junior officer should probably need a tow.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.910
 Learn to delegate first, and that usually comes from talking with

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.490
 their non commissioned officer that may be working with them. Contrary

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:51.070
 to popular belief, the a mentor for an officer can often be a non

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.660
 commissioned officer. And in some ways, that's more appropriate because

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.240
 that's who you're really gonna learn from. They will show you

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.820
 how to delegate. And then as you learn and glean information from them,

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.400
 you can kind of make your own decisions on how much you should insert

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.980
 yourself in certain situations and and weirdo and whereto generally

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.560
 back off and just let things run themselves. Uh, most importantly,

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.140
 I think it's just you need to show that your present you need to

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.720
 know your people. You need to know they need to know you're around,

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.300
 but you also need to stay out of the way so you don't prevent them

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.880
 from doing what they're really good at.
