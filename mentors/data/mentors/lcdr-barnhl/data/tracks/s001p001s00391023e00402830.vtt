00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.050
decisions come in all flavors. They're big decisions and small decisions.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:11.260
 Sometimes the decision comes in just deciding what needs to be on

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.460
 a flight schedule. Other times, it can revolve around deciding what

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.670
 type of rankings you're gonna put Ford for your junior officers. I

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.870

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.100
 of the base to another, which is not not a small thing to decide because

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.310
 it requires an entire squadron for move to one place to another.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.510
 So there's not all types of decisions. There's not specifically one

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.720
 type that you will look. You would experience summer easy summer more

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.920
 difficult and require Cem Cem deliberation. Okay,
