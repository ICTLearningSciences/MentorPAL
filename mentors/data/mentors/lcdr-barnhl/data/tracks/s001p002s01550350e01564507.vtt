00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.470
thing I've done in the Navy that's gotten a lot of press, really two things,

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.080
 and they're both of all flying. I'm not necessarily good. Uh,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.700
 the first time the first was when I was doing a cross country flight

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.320
 from Atsugi, Japan, down to Okinawa. Thio, begin some training. About

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.930
 halfway down my engine, cowling came open. Uh, and I was looking

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.550
 for a place to land so I could close it. What we were worried about

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.170
 is that the engine cowling would come off and then get in our rotor

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.780
 system, and we would have had and we would have crashed aircraft. Well,

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.400
 we ended up doing because, as you know, the the shore of Japan

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.020
 can be fairly dropped fairly precipitously is you know, we tried to

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.630
 maybe find a beach. The only beach we found plenty of had a lot of people

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.250
 on it. But as you move down the beach, that kind of the crowd's

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.870
 kind of dispersed. So we ended up landing on the beach and I thought

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.490
 that I'd gotten kind of away with it. Not that I was trying to get

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:10.100
 away with anything, but as soon as we landed Japanese, gentlemen,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.720
 stepped out of the woods and just colic and just looked at us, was probably

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.340
 fairly surprised that helicopter was there. We shut down, we

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.950
 closed up. And then after I called my my squadron to let him know what

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.570
 had happened, we took back off and without incident, unfortunately.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.190
 So that that got a little bit of notice. The other thing. I was

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.800
 in a helicopter crash about 10 years ago, and that must surely got a

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.420
 lot of press.
