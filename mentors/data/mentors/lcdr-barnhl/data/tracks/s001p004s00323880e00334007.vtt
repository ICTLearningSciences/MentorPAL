00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.230
I have a few mentors that I've looked up to over the over the past several

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.600
 years. Generally, they have been former commanding officers or

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.980
 something like that. Um, and that's pretty normal. Also former department

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.360
 heads that I gained a lot of what I think valuable leadership

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.730
 skills from, um, there that I think you'll as you move through your

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.110

 that have been, if you'd benefited me in the law in the long run, you

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.990
 don't really want to close doors on your superiors because you never

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.370
 know where they're gonna end up, and sometimes they're positional

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.740
 authority. I can help you get jobs. You might otherwise have more
