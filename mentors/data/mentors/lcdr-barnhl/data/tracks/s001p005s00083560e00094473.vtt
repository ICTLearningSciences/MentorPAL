00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.170
so different generations have different views of what's appropriate, Uh,

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.490
 but I but that's really a perception. I think if you treat people

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.800
 with respect, then then you don't have to worry about the difference

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.120
 in views of what's appropriate or not. You know, things you learned

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.440
 early in life. Keep your hands to yourself. Talk to people as if you

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.760
 were talking to your mother. All those types of ideas you could be.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:38.070
 You don't need to worry about how the generational, uh, of what's

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.390
 appropriate. Cross generational across generations if you just but

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.710
 exhibit respect for that individual. Now, some things you can't help

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.030
 some people are. Some people are sensitive to how you interact with

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.340
 them. Some people do not respond well to the directness that is inherent

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.660
 in the military, and you do need you may need to soften that a

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.980
 little bit. That's generally my advice on that
