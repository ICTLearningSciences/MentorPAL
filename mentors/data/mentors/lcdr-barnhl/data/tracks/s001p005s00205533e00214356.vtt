00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.670
the easiest way to avoid biases just to evaluate a person on on their

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.500
 accomplishments. Um, that's that's the first and foremost the best way.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.320
 I think we're all inherently biased in some way, shape or form,

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.150
 and we can't avoid it completely. But there's no I've ever really come

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.970
 across a situation that I felt when I was immediately giving someone,

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.790
 ah, benefit of doubt because of a specific aspect of their character,

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.620
 or perhaps a race or something like that that I did not consider

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.440
 for somebody else. What I hope I've done is that I've considered

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.270
 what they've done as the primary reason I've told them they've done

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.090
 well or have not.
