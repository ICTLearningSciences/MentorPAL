00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.410
I haven't separated from the military, so I don't entirely know. But there

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.960
 is a process of getting getting out. There's various transition

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.520
 assistance programs that you have to attend. Um, and you know, you

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.080
 have to do various medical physicals and and stuff like that. Uh, but

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.630
 I haven't researched in depth of what? That what that entails, but

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.190
 it shouldn't be too hard to figure out.
