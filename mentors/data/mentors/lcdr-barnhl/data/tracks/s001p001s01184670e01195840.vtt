00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.970
the most common mistakes new leaders make. I would appropriately term

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.090
 that people who have come into new leadership positions because I realize

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.210
 is not realizing that they I need to listen to their people. Usually

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:21.340
 new leadership. New new positions don't just spontaneously arrive.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.460
 There's usually some sort of infrastructure underneath that includes

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.580
 people have been doing that type of work for a while. As a leader,

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.700
 you need to leverage that experience. You don't know what you're

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.820
 talking about until you've leveraged that experience. If you don't

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.940
 do that, you're basically operating off a theory. And you have to

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.060
 ask yourself, Well, what if my theory is wrong about what you're supposed

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.190
 to be doing? The people below you, the people that end up working

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.310
 for you, that I've been doing that for for decent amount of time

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.430
 can kind of cage you and direct you and help you decide what direction

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.550
 you need to take this new position.
