00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.640
Now you're gonna work with all kinds of people, people that you disagree

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.440
 with, people that you really like, people that you don't like. But

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.230
 it turns out you're still gonna have to work with. You have to figure

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.020
 a way around that, Uh, I've never been in a situation where there

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.820
 was someone that just, absolutely could not work with. If you find

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.610
 yourself in that situation part of it's probably you remember that

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.410
 no matter how long you are in a place, you're eventually gonna leave

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.200
 as probably going to be on the order of two years or three years and

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.990
 that person or that person is gonna leave. So just being able to deal

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.790
 with that person free for that period of time, that might be your

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.580
 best strategy. I do not want you to take that to mean that if this

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.370
 if, if you're working with a difficult person that is denigrating that

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.170
 is disrespectful or just doing things that are just plain wrong

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.960
 that is different than someone who is just holds a totally different

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.760
 but perhaps equally valid perspective on and you argue about that.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.550
 Those are two separate things
