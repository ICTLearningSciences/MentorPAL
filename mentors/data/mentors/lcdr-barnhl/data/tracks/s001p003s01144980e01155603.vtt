00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.580
taxes in the military work exactly the same as they do outside the military.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.310
 The one caveat, I would say is that they're certain states that

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.040
 you can. Then you can claim his resident of that. You will not pay

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.770
 state income taxes. All you have to have done this essentially been

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.500
 stationed in that state. So if your in flight school, getting a driver's

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.230
 license in Florida will allow you to claim residents in Florida

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.960
 and therefore you will not be any state income tax if you are married,

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.700
 then the than your spouse can claim residents in that state, too.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.430
 Uh, and if you're living in California after subsequently have been

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.160
 somewhere else, state tax paying California will generally be returned

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.890
 to the spouse because they the idea is that they were forced

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.620
 to be in California due to military service. So there's some perks that

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.350
 their cover other states that can't recall has your income taxes

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.080
 well
