00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.300
so do your time as a leader. You'll and you'll have a lot of different

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.750
 experiences that you'll consider that you won't believe you will have.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.200
 Some of them will be truly extraordinary and b thankfully, Adam

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.650
 others You just think I cannot believe that that just happened. Um,

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.100
 one of the, uh, one has somewhat tragic. Not exactly funny is that we

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.540
 had a sailor who decided Thio go hiking on a long weekend. Um, well,

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.990
 and this is in Eastern San Diego County, where a lot of desert in

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.440
 their rattlesnakes there have been here tonight about seven miles.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.890
 And then he reached down and was moving some six. Elway got bit by a

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.340
 rattlesnake. His method of taking care of that problem to prevent the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.790
 venom from spreading was to shoot off with a gun. His thumb, which,

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.240
 as you might know, is not going to stop the venom from spending spreading.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.690
 Fortunately, he was able to get that situation and get to

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.140
 a hospital and saved his life. But that's just an example of the types

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.590
 of things that you no doubt will experience. Another one was when

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.030
 we had a sailor who was drunk. He was walking back to his barracks,

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.480
 decided he could not make it the extra 50 feet to get inside and in

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.930
 his room. So he went to sleep under our duty van. The next morning,

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.380
 the duty driver started of the van and ran him over. He broke the guy's

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.830
 back and the guy was medically discharged from the Navy. It's sad.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.280
 It was truly kind of a sad situation.
