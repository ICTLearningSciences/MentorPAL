00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.100
Traditionally, aviation does not put a huge value on education for the

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.340
 very fact that it's a compressed timeline almost throughout your career.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.590
 There a few opportunities just to go to school. So if you want

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.840
 to go to school, you have to do it on your time or wait to until you

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.080
 reach in kind of a prescribed period of time, usually at your department.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.330
 Head to her to go toe to go to school. If that's if that's the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.580
 case. If you do, wait until then until after your department or you're

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.820
 likely going to G o Thio uh, the Naval War College, which is a

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.070
 good school there. You just don't won't necessarily have as much choice

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.310
 on what you what you focus on, Um, and that's largely driven by

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.560
 the fact that they the the community managers, wants you to have, ah,

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.810
 better education. But they can't let you leave the community for

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:09.050
 too long, and that's a one year program. This is opposed to going to

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.300
 an outside university or press a naval postgraduate school, which has

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.550
 a variety of focuses, but it takes a bit more time to typically finish

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.790
 finish those finish those programs alternately get a graduate

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.040
 education on your own time, usually during a short tour, and sometimes

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.290
 your commands will be flexible. Thio missing work for that type of

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.530
 thing. But generally speaking, education and aviation is not not necessarily

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.780
 highly sought after.
