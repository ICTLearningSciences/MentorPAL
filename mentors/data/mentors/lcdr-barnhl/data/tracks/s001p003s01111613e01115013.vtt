00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.100
since I was commissioned in 2005. I've moved seven times, but it largely

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.350
 depends on where you are. If you're in a large fleet concentration

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.600
 area, like perhaps San Diego or Norfolk, you might be able to find

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.850
 consecutive jobs there and not move for a significant period of time.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.100
 I've known people not to stay in the same place for 12 years. I did

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.350
 not take that route. I wanted to move. I wanted to move to different

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.600
 places and I that was better for me. It just depends on where you

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.850
 live in what you're doing.
