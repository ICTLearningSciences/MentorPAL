no matter where you are, there's never convenient time to have a child.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.290
 It always detracts from professional life and what you want to do.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.510
 Uh uh, or other things you might want to D'oh! Um, the Navy is can

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.740
 be a bit more stressful in that way because, uh, you all you might have

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.960
 a child while you're deployed. That is a huge stretcher. I have

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.180
 many friends. I've had that happen to you. That does not happen to me.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.400
 Fortunately, I've been present for all of my kid's birthday at births

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.620
 and been able to be available to my wife, but during those times,

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.840
 But that's definitely consideration. So if you know you're gonna

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.070
 have a kid while you're going to be deployed, you need to make sure

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.290
 there's a solid support network to help your help your wife out. When,

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.510
 while she's at home
