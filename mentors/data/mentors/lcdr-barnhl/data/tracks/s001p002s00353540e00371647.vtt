00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.460
well. The first obvious answer that shows that shows encourages accountability

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.080
 is that there are consequences that if you're if you're not

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.690
 doing what you're supposed to, d'oh! And these can be, these consequences

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.310
 could be immediate or you know they could be can manifest manifest

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.920
 himself later. Um, so that's that's very basic. But another thing

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.540
 that can facilitate accountability indirectly is that even if you

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.150
 don't do something right or if you do something so par, knowing that

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.770
 you can do better later and it's okay, there's no that that while

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.380
 you don't want to do poorly, there's still a chance to make up for

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:57.000
 what you make up for what you did, um, and that I think can help lead

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.610
 someone. Two. You're just establish accountability in the cells from

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.230
 the get go. It makes them more comfortable. It doesn't mean that

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.840
 they're going to like Okay, well, if I didn't, I don't do well this

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.460
 time. There's always next time. I don't think people naturally see it

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.070
 like that. Uh, I think they know that there's understanding in their

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.690
 superior, um, that they expect them to do well. But But there's not

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.300
 this idea that there's not a feeling that perfection is expected

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.920
 or achievable by there by their superior officer
