00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.690
there's nothing specific to a junior officer. As faras benefits are concerned,

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.540
 they should take advantage of. Um, really. The most important

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.380
 thing about benefits is knowing what they are, knowing how they work.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.220
 Um, sometimes their perks that you encounter that are that are

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.060
 more specific to the locale that you're residing in that that you might.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.910
 There's someone obscure and you might not know about him. So, for

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.750
 instance, if you live in San Diego, uh, yet like to free Seaworld

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.590
 passes every year, little things like that, you know, they're they're

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.440
 especially military friendly towns. There are a lot of little things

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.280
 you can look for, but as faras general military benefits, there's

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.120
 not really anything that I would say that is not being taken revenge

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.960
 of budget your officers. Uh, one thing it will highlight is tthe

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.810
 e post 9 11 g. I. Bill, um, you will have access to that on. You will

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.650
 have the opportunity to transfer that over to your um to your family

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.490
 members. If you decide you don't need to use it on, that could be

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.340
 a cost savings. When there's that family goes to college, if they end

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.180
 up doing that. Certainly something consider, uh, any. But you need

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.020
 to stay on top of it. Because if the folks that should be helping

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.860
 you file that paperwork, drop it, like, happened to me, you'll find

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.710
 that, uh, you know, the transfer period is almost over, and you almost

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.550
 miss it.
