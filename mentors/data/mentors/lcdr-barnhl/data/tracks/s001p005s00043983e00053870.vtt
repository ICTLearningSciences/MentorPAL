00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.200
one thing about the about the Navy, is it? I believe it represents a demographic.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.550
 It's a representative demographic of our society, so you'll

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.910
 usually see sexual harassment in the enlisted ranks when you see

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.260
 it, Um, see what she will. I think education has a lot to play in.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.610
 Education. Perspective has a lot of playing how we interact with in

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.960
 our genders. Um, and I think that ends up. That's one reason why you

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.310
 Seymour sexual harassment, the enlisted ranks than the junior officer

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.660
 or your officer ranks. Asshole. That obviously doesn't mean that

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.020
 sexual harassment is absent in the officer ranks. It is definitely there.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.370
 I just think it's less so than in the and the enlisted ranks.
