00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.030
My last operational duty was in San Diego with helicopter. See Combat

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.220
 Squadron 23 were hello? Were they were a helicopter squadron. But the

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.400
 interesting thing about H. C 23 is that they're one of the first squadrons

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.590
 to incorporate unmanned aerial vehicles. A CZ part of their,

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.770
 uh, it's part of their platform. So in addition to flying manned aircraft,

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.960
 we were responsible for flying unmanned aircraft while down

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.140
 there I was a department head, which means I was in charge of one of

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.330
 about four departments that make up an aviation squatter, and I was

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.510
 in charge of anywhere between 10 and 50 people at any one time. Basically,

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.700
 the department head is responsible for making sure the squadron

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.880
 is running, they using the knowledge that they have accumulated

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.070
 over their career. And typically, a department head has about 11 years

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.250
 experience or so they use that knowledge to kind of ensure the squadron

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.440
 is going in the right direction for the commanding officer.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.620
 Of course, they have no no authority to command anybody in the squadron,

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.810
 as that is for the commanding officer and perhaps his executive

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.990
 officer. But if the department's aren't working well, then the squadron

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.180
 can have problems in a real hurry. So between the lieutenant commanders

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.360
 in the squadron and the non commissioned officers, that is

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.550
 the chief senior Chiefs and master chief's there's There's two groups

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.730
 of people probably most responsible for ensuring its smooth running

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.920
 of aviation squadron. The squadron itself was attached to the littoral

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.100
 combat ship, UH, which was is a small ship, and that I won't describe

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.290
 in too much detail. But it's relatively new small and that we

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.470
 would deploy with both, as I said, unmanned aircraft and manned aircraft.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.660
 And typically we are. Squadron would deploy to Singapore with

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.840
 the littoral combat ship, which is called NLCS, and the LCS would be

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.030
 based out of there so they'd be in and out of Singapore with a on

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.210
 aviation component, every switching out every six months.
