if you were to pick one thing, uh, to learn about your team members, oftentimes

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.660
 it's where they came from. The matters most, because I can

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.570
 give you a perspective on to how they look at the world. Um, if someone

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.480
 comes from a place where they grew up thinking there's right and

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.380
 there's wrong and there's nothing in between that is very different

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.290
 than someone who might have grown up in a place to I saw a lot of

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.200
 gray. A lot of things that might have been right. It might have been

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.110
 wrong, and, you know, they appreciate the nuances A life. Um, where

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.010
 person came from won't give you every piece of information you need

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.920
 to know about them, but it certainly gives you a starting place.
