00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.710
in the Navy had any military service. Formally, it's, isn't it? It's the

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.560
 responsibility of these Senior officer two get to know their subordinates.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.420
 But when the opportunity arises for that to happen, however,

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.270
 the senior officer facilitates that the junior officer, orgy or subordinate

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.130
 needs to take part. It doesn't need to be. It doesn't need

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.980
 to be for a lengthy period of time. But doing that can can establish

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.840
 a personal report with the commanding officer and is as good as you

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.690
 are professionally. There is a personal aspect. All thi this. You

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.550
 need to realize that even in your personal relationship with your with

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.410
 your senior officer, they are evaluating you. It's not necessarily

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.260
 a bad away, and they might be doing it unconsciously. But they'll

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.120
 remember the things you say that how you acted, what you did. So if

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.970
 you go out with them and you end up having way too much to drink, they

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.830
 will not forget that even though it might have been a one time thing,

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.680
 Uh, so basically, in on the flip side of that while it is on the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.540
 on the senior officers is a senior officer's responsibility to get

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.390
 Thio facilitate getting to know their subordinates. I don't think

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.250
 there's anything wrong with periodically seeing if your senior officer

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.110
 wants to go get some lunch or something like that, Uh, perhaps in

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.960
 a group setting or something like that. So if a bunch of junior officers

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.820
 going out and you say, Hey, let's invite our department head that

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.670
 may be fairly appropriate. Also, I have been fortunate enough to

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.530
 be in several places where there are officers, clubs, and you talking

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.380
 with your bosses in the Officers club is usually a has usually been

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.240
 on effective way to get to know them. Um, what? Whatever, you know,

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.090
 whatever establishment allows that it would be similar appropriate.
