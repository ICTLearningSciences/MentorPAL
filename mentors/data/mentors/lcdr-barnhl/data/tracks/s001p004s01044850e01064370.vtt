00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.460
One thing about the officer corps is that recognition certainly comes,

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.070
 but it usually comes, say, at the end of the tour, basically to say

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.670
 thank you for your service well done and good luck in your future career

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.280
 endeavors. You'll see a lot more recognition in the A list ranks,

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.890
 which is more appropriate, in my opinion, um, I would say the recognition

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.500
 that you receive comes more from how the years your subordinates

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.110
 interact with you during your time at your whatever duty station

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.710
 you're at. That's the recognition that it was always valued to meet

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.320
 one. I could tell you one of the most valuable pieces of recognition,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.930
 and it was implicit. It wasn't direct that I received was when

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.540
 one of my subordinates asked for a recommendation. Uh, for test pilot

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.150
 school, I was I mean, I was I was just a few months ago that he asked

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.750
 for this and he was kind of down because he didn't get the ranking,

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.360
 that he wanted it the squatter. But he and he wasn't too excited

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.970
 about where he was going to go next. So he decided to apply to something

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.580
 different. I happily gave him a recommendation because he deserved

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.190
 it, and it was awesome to see that he succeeded in getting what

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.790
 he wanted and just simply be a part of that, that that was one of

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.400
 the most rewarding experiences that I've had in the Navy. And while

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.010
 that's not exactly recognition, it definitely felt like I contributed

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.620
 to something. I contributed to someone's career aspirations. Do not

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.230
 think that Lieutenant Commander's recommendation had a lot to do with

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.830
 it. He had a lot of other people supporting him in that, but it

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.440
 was nice to be a part of, and he and the and appreciated my efforts.
