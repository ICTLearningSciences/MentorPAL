WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.390
a view of what I've been doing has certainly changed. I would say that

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.930
 I was very naive and myopic and how I viewed what I thought I was gonna

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.480
 be doing when I first was commissioned. But as the realities became

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.020
 more and more parents, I would say, my son I was a bit more became

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.560
 a bit more cynical than I originally was, which is not necessarily

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.100
 a positive thing. But at the same time, when you see the reality

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.650
 of what you're you're doing it, it can help you prioritize the things

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.190
 that the matter. Okay, um well, no, not all going to take off from

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.730
 aircraft carriers and shoot down makes. That's just not reality. What

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.270
 we are going to do is spend a lot of time training for something

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.810
 that we don't end up doing. Um, so, like any job, while this is definitely

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:07.360
 more exciting than most, that is for sure, you kind of end up

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.900
 in a routine of ensuring the normal things get done, you know, making

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.440
 sure people get trained, making sure that you're you're you're passing

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.980
 muster on inspections and things like that. Um, and it becomes

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.530
 kind. It does become kind of run of the mill even though you're flying

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.070
 a $30 million machine and in some respects, $100 million machines.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.610
 So, uh, even doing something exciting like that, you can kind of

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.150
 find yourself getting into a routine and just realizing that this is

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.700
 this is at its very core, a job doesn't mean it. It's not a noble job,

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.240
 but it is still kind of a job, and that's one of the things that

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.780
 have come to terms with over my time in the Navy.
