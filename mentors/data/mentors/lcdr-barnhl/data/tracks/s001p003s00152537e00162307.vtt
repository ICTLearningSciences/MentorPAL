00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.620
So after my helicopter crash, I think it would have been very easy for

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.390
 folks. Toe Oster size me, Um, because it was so high profile. But I

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:18.160
 had a commanding officer who went to bat for me, and he, I think, single

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.930
 handedly made sure I was able to fly again. Along with that, the

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.700
 folks that I worked with were tremendously supportive. They were

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:35.470
 not derisive, though I wouldn't have blamed him if they could have been

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.240
 or if they were so just. The people that I worked with were remarkably

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:47.010
 supportive. Uh, and that is one reason why I wanted to fly again,

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.780
 huh? Because those people put forth the effort to support me during

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.550
 that time.
