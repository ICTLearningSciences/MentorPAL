00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.600
the spectrum of tasks and skills and missions that you will experience

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.340
 an aviation field are are almost infinite. I could not enumerated every

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.090
 single one that will help you grow as a person and an officer.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.830
 But generally speaking, the interaction with people and how you deal

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.580
 with it helps you learn a lot about yourself, helps you hone your leadership

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.320
 skills, as you might imagine. And that's one of the best things

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.070
 about being in the military. You really learn a lot about yourself

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.820
 when you're making decisions. If you're an introspective person

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.560
 and think about what you did and you're willing to learn from your

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.310
 mistakes, your interactions with people can certainly show that on.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.050
 That's one of the biggest things I'd say That's fairly generic, and

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.800
 I think that is a cross community of borders. But it's still true nonetheless.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.550
 Generally speaking, also, you know, being in the Navy, you're

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.290
 going to see a lot of things, a lot of things that you would never

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.040
 see if you stayed in a private or civilian sector. It gives you

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.780
 perspective on the world, gives you perspective on people. It will help

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.530
 you encounter people that you otherwise wouldn't have encountered,

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.270
 and he will. You will be generally a better person for those experience

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.020
 experiences
