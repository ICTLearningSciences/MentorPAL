00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.000
being in the military, you will advance to some degree at first while

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.150
 you stay in. There are certain milestones in your career that are just

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.300
 natural filtering points for any community, and I should say every

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.450
 community is different and and how they operate in this way. Some

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.610
 communities have Maura Trish in earlier, which could be considered a

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.760
 function of the ability to just get out earlier. For instance, in the

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.910
 aviation community, the first time you condone decide to leave. The

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.060
 Navy is really after you've spent 10 years in as opposed to the service

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.210
 community, where you can get out and about five years. So there's

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.360
 some differences in that regard. But in that time frame you will

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.510
 at least attained the rank of lieutenant or 03 as it, as it is termed,

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.660
 um, moving past that it's a bit more competitive because some of

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.810
 it is not simply moving up in rank, but some of it is attaining greater

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.960
 positional authority, and it's really the positional authority

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.120
 positions that have the greatest filtering effect. So if you do not

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.270
 end up doing well enough in one positional in one position, you may

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.420
 not be selected for the next position. I would also say that a lot

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.570
 of it is based on timing. Timing is a huge factor in how you and how

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.720
 you promote so, uh, there. And that's something that you can can't

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.870
 necessarily control but in some ways is foreseeable. So, to put it succinctly,

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.020
 there is plenty of room for promotion and upward mobility.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.170
 But you have to understand there are There are certainly checkpoints

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.320
 where that act as natural filtering mechanisms. Um, timing is saying,

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.480
 is a significant factor. But if you do not perform in those jobs,

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.630
 you most certainly will not promote, regardless of timing. A typical

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.780
 career path is, is whatever the community makes it, Mike my career

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.930
 path or what's the typical career path? And aviation is gonna be

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.080
 different when you join. When you get to the point that I'm in, the

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.230
 Navy will have well established, says different appreciation for different

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.380
 things by that time. So my career path, uh, and I I would say

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.530
 that I stayed on a typical career path For the majority of my tour.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.680
 You do a C tour and then you go go to a short tour that is considered

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.840
 a production tour. So that would be It is an example that would be

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.990
 training pilots to move into the fleet and, in my case, specifically

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.140
 training play of pilots that are operating on the aircraft that was

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.290
 flying as opposed to initial flight training. After that, you go

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.440
 to a disassociated see tour, which means you aren't necessarily going

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.590
 to fly. If you're an aviator, you're gonna be attached to perhaps

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.740
 something a different unit. You might be ship's company. And then after

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.890
 that tour, which is a C tour, they even move into your department

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.040
 head to her. And the department head tour is probably the greatest

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.190
 has the greatest filtering effect of any position in aviation. If you

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.350
 do not attain a competitive number one ranking out of the department

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.500
 head, you will not have the chance to screen for command, which

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.650
 is the next positional authority. And essentially, is what all of the

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.800
 the personnel folks consider to be like their job to prepare every

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.950
 person to take command, knowing that not everyone will
