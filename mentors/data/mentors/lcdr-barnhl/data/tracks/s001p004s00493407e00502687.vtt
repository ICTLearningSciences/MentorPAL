00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.130
the best leader I've ever had. A deadly calm. A mentor is was a a commander

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.410
 who was my boss when I was in Japan for the second time. He was

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.690
 not gonna be a commanding officer, but he had the rank of 05 And he

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.970
 had a very easy going attitude towards everything journal professionally.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.250
 And it just kind of showed that you did not have to be hard

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.530
 nosed about everything. You did not have to be overly demanding about

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:37.810
 everything in order to do a good job. And he did a fantastic job.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.090
 He made the working environment very good, enjoyable even. And the people

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.370
 in the working of environment. While we didn't always agree, we

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.650
 got along very well, I think, largely because of his leadership
