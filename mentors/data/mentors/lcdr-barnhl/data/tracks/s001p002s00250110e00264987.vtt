00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.790
the easiest and most effective way to reward a sailor is being very vocal

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.740
 in public about the good job they've done, uh, part of it. It's

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.680
 easy to say, Well, that's their job, and that's what they're supposed

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.630
 to do. But, you know, being saying, telling someone they did a good

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.570
 job in front of everybody go. It goes a long way. I think it makes

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.510
 you mean I'm just talking about my own personal experience. If someone

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.460
 said I did a good job then and then you feel good. It makes me gives,

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.400
 gives a person a steak and what and what they are and what you're

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.350
 doing. Uh, the Navy, of course, and all military branches have their

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.290
 own ways of rewarding people with promotions and awards and all

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.230
 these other things. And you should you should work hard to make that

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.180
 a normal part of the professional environment. That's not hard to

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.120
 dio. Any good commanding officer and leader should be pushing to reward

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.070
 their people with the appropriate naval commendations or what military

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.010
 commendations as it were. Um, but I think sometimes just the

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.960
 positive words can mean mortar folks than putting a ribbon on a chest.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.900
 They go. The ribbon on the chest puts put, helps people promote and

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.840
 keep going in their career path. But that doesn't automatically mean

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.790
 it shows what somebody thinks of them. If if I come to you and say

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.730
 you did a very good job, thank you for all the work you've done that

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.680
 can go further than just a formal ceremony, said doing something

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.620
 somewhere.
