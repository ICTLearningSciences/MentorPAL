00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.580
you will. All officers will accrue leave at the rate of 2.5 days per month,

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.310
 which eagles out to 30 days a year. Uh, you will not be able to

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:18.040
 use 30 days a year, and you will largely usually accumulate leave

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.770
 to the point where they make you lose some. I believe it's about 60.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.500
 At 60 days, you can accrue anymore leave. So, uh, with that in mind,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.240
 usually when you have it, when you have the opportunity, I was always

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.970
 told, Leave is a mission, so and we don't and we want to avoid people

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.700
 losing leave if we can all help it so encourage as a leader encouraging

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.430
 people to take leave, they will work hard enough to deserve

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.160
 it, whether now or later. So don't be afraid to take leave. Sometimes

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.890
 it may be denied, but that's usually the exception.
