00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.060
one of the attributes that I look for in somebody that might be working

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.270
 for me or even if they're one of my peers, how were they gonna anticipate

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:16.480
 problems? Uh, I've worked with plenty of people that will see

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.690
 the problem in front of them, deal with it and deal with it effectively,

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.900
 but failed to see what the second and third order effects are

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.110
 gonna be of this problem are even dealing with this problem. How does

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.320
 it? Because sometimes the way you deal with the problem changes the

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.540
 way you're gonna end up, uh, you're gonna end up operating in some

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.750
 respect. Uh, strangely enough, I've it seems like my experience with

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.960
 women in the military is that they're better at anticipating problems

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.170
 than men. But they might also be a function of the fact that you're

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.380
 generally with a lot more men in the military and those s o. You

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.590
 notice those things, perhaps about one and more. Um, I always valued

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.800
 a subordinate more when they were thinking ahead at what could happen

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.010
 with the current problems that we were dealing with
