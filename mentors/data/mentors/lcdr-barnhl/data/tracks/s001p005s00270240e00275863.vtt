There are a lot of programs to help sailors deal with grief or loss. But

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.220
 I think really the most effective one are the people around that

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.910
 sailor. I said If a sailor feels isolated, that can oftentimes just

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.590
 exacerbate the feelings of of loss or grief. But if they know that there's

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.280
 someone around for support, then that can go a long way to helping

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.970
 them. My wife, not in the Navy, but she was very instrumental

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.650
 in helping another woman get through a miscarriage, and it wasn't because

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.340
 she was trying to do everything for the woman or solve her problems.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.020
 She was simply there. So in my opinion, the very fact that my

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.710
 wife was there and available to that woman went a long way to helping

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.390
 the woman deal with a very difficult and grief stricken process.
