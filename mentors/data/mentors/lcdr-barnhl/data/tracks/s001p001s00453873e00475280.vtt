00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.010
one of the most important things that I've learned. Ah, feature, if you

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:11.160
 if you want to call it, that is it is the exposure you get exposed

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.320
 to all kinds of things. You get exposed to different people from different

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.480
 backgrounds. He get exposed to different parts of the world.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.630
 It gives you perspective. So my viewpoint on how the world may work

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.790
 is far different now than what it was when I first joined the military,

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.950
 and I give that give I give the military credit for helping me

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.100
 develop this. I think I'm better for it. Um, when you when you graduate

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.260
 from anywhere, are you you know, you are young, younger. You are

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.420
 very sure of what you think, what you think a lot of the time. But

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.570
 really, you don't have a lot of experience to back that up when the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.730
 military exposes you to do these different ways of doing things with

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.890
 different people and seeing different countries and being on a ship

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.040
 for any length of time. In my particular experience, you kind of gives

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.200
 you a feel for for perhaps what's happening in the world and that

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.350
 perhaps things aren't exactly is how you exactly how you how you thought

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.510
 they were. And that's one of the most important parts of being

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.670
 in the military. And within that I think the most important part about

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.820
 being in the military's again exposure to the people and and it's

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.980
 whether it's subordinates or peers or in and superiors. Uh, you you

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.140
 learn the most by listening to the people around you, and that includes

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.290
 the people you totally disagree with and and probably never will.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.450
 At least you understand their point of view. It gives you a perspective

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.610
 on the way they think, how they're going to do their job and

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.760
 how you can relate to them. Um, and people like them, and that's a

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.920
 very good thing.
