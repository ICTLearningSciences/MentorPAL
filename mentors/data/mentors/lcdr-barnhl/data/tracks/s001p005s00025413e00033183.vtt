sexual misconduct is highlighted because it has not been perhaps appropriately

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.620
 dealt with in the recent past, and that and that's that's a

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.010
 good thing, However, uh, crimes that are comparable to sexual misconduct

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.390
 or seen Justus Justus bad. They just don't necessarily get the

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.780
 same same coverage that you might see with sexual misconduct. So I'd

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:33.160
 say they were on the same playing field. It's just not It's not, as

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.550
