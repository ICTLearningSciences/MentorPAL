00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.700
Oh, my. My parental role models obviously impacted me the most because

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.550
 they were consistent and always there, and they demanded a lot for

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.400
 me. Um, my the other role models that I had, whether they were coaches

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.250
 or teachers or anything like that, you know, they they certainly

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.100
 contributed significantly to my, uh, who I am. They supported me, and

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.950
 we're willing thio support my goals when I was young. Um, they say

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.800
 they impacted me numerous ways from making me who I am today. Whether

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.650
 I whether looking back, I ended up agreeing with them or not, I still

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.500
 appreciate the types of things they taught me. An impacted me through

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.350
 my life. You gotta remember you don't become who you are by yourself.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.200
 You're there are tons of people that have an impact you, even

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.050
 if it's like small micro impacts. So you've got to give those folks

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.900
 credit and showing you how to be a hate contributing human being
