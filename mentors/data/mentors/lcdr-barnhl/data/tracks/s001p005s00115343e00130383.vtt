00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.880
days, So you're not gonna be over control everybody's actions all the

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.910
 time, But you can let them know what the boundaries are. The best way

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.940
 to do that. Just be clear. You can't cover every situation. But if

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.960
 you are clear on what you expect from people, um, those boundaries

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.990
 will naturally be in place if you're if you're concerned about people

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.020
 of different rakes cohabitating off base. Uh, I'm not sure there's

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.050
 something that you can do about that If they're already doing it, um,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.080
 you can have what I would say is you want to try to deal with it

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.110
 at the lowest level possible. A lot of times that's engaging the senior

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.140
 list of leadership toe. Let them know what's going on and see if

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.160
 they can handle it, because oftentimes that's enough. And if you're

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.190
 going in establishing these boundaries, you need tohave your non commissioned

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.220
 officers on board and agreeing with you in order to make

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.250
 that case
