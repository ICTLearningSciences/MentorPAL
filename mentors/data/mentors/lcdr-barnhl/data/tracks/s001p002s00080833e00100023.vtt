00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.720
one of the best things about being in aviation specifically and in the

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.580
 Navy as a whole is the camaraderie that you establish with each other.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.450
 I think it's fairly unique to any to this type of organization.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.310
 There aren't that many other organizations where you're going to do

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.180
 something you're gonna You could be in harm's way with this, these other

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.040
 people and, uh, you know you need to have a personal connection

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.910
 with them as well as professional. So I think it is appropriate both

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.770
 with peers and with subordinates to no socially gather to have frank

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.640
 conversations about personal lives. That way you get to know each

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.500
 other. You know where people can't come from. You know what people

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.370
 are thinking about and you can figure out ways to try and help him out.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.230
 Um, the. Unlike other other organizations, I think the line between

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.100
 personal and professional is more blurry in the military, whether

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.960
 it should be or not. But I think it's intentionally blurry as very

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.830
 well met, perhaps should be. Obviously, there's some things you need

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.690
 to be careful of. There is a line, but I don't think the line is well

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.560
 established kind of, like one of those things, you know when you

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.420
 see it. So what you need to do is ensure that you never see it. Nothing

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.290
 could be construed is overly overly personal. There is a line between

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.150
 you and your subordinates. You need to be clear. Well, what that,

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.020
 Linus, but is that it doesn't need to be so stark and, uh, and

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.880
 and and clear for that to be the case, you can also rely on your non

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.750
 commissioned officers to help you establish that one.
