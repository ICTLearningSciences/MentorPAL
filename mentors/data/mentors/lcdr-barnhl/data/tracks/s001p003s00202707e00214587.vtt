00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.770
I don't think there is a particular career risk that I can point Thio

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.700
 there was that truly gave me any sort of anxiety, but I think it's more

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.620
 more, I think you know what? What, what types of duty stations do

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.550
 you want to go to type thing? Perhaps. I think going to Japan was

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.470
 a risk, you know, But it was more risk in that it was going to strain

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.400
 my marriage. Not necessarily a bad away. But, you know, we were newly

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.320
 married relatively, and we decided to go to Japan with where there

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.250
 was a high operational tempo. So I was gonna have way had a fresh

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.170
 marriage, and we're gonna be separated relatively shortly after being

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.100
 married. You know that that was a risk. I ended up working out. Well,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.020
 for us, that was they'd been in the end, it made us both stronger.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.950
 But I can't say that I have had a particular career risk, a choice

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.870
 that I've made the biggest risk I could say. I guess I would say,

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.800
 Is it going to school going back to school at the time that I did?

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.720
 Because this type of education is not always seen fondly from a career

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.650
 perspective
