00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.200
if you're going overseas. First of all, congratulations. That's a good

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.560
 thing. Um, I think one of the first things you can do is just learn

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.910
 about learn a little bit about where you're going. Um, I knew a lot

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.260
 of people that came out to Japan when I was there, and they didn't

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.620
 want to go there. Uh, I was fortunate enough to go out. There is a mid

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.970
 shipment, so I knew a little bit about what I was getting into. But

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.320
 not everybody does that. So but learning a little bit about the place

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.680
 you're going understand? Learning a little bit about the culture

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.030
 helps put it in perspective. And you might find some things that you

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.380
 like that you didn't realize you're going to like what I can. I can

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.740
 say that that being overseas is with the best experiences of I've

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.090
 ever had, and I would recommend it to anybody. But if you don't want

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.440
 to go and the Navy tells you that you're going to go, then uh, it's

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.800
 best if you just embrace it and then kind of dive straight into it.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.150
 Despite the resentment you might feel
