counseling is about feedback giving feedback. Too many times I've been

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.350
 in a finished report debriefing the The outcome was You're doing a

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.600
 good job. Keep up the good work and that's great. I like doing a good

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.860

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.620
 skill in itself. You have You have to teach people how to do that.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.870
 If you're not giving feedback as a leader, you're not helping your people

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.120
 out
