00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.020
handling bad news is one of the worse things to deal with as a leader,

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.200
 but you have to be responsible for it. Um, the best thing you can do

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.370
 is be direct about it. Don't dance around the issue. Uh, be very.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.540
 Matter of fact, this is the situation. This is what we need to do. This

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.710
 is what we can do about it. Or if there's nothing you could do about

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.890
 it, Uh, you know, make that perhaps make that clear to, But on

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.060
 the flip side of that, make it clear that you and the entirety of the

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.230
 command is going to help however they can in whatever the situation

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.400
 may be, whatever the bad news might might entail, the command needs

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.580
 to be at the disposal of the member to help out, however they can.
