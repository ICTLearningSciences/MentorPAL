00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.810
So one thing to consider about your prior experience in the military experience

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.760
 prior to the military is that they intentionally make these

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.720
 jobs, generally speaking, available to everybody of all types. So

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.680
 I was a history major, and I became a pilot. You wouldn't necessarily

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.640
 say that. There's ah, uh, a relationship to those things. There are

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.590
 plenty of people that air engineers, for instance, that our pilots,

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.550
 but there are plenty of people that are not. So you see, as far as

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.510
 the journal warfare communities are concerned, you can. You can gain

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.470
 disqualifications without having what would be considered the right

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.420
 degree or training. Prior to that. For more specialized type things

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.380
 you might need need a background in whatever you want to do. But nothing

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.340
 particularly comes to mind is what what those might be. Educational

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.290
 opportunities that air outside the Navy say, For instance, you

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.250
 know political military masters, which could take you to civility,

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.210
 civilian institution like Stanford, Harvard, Princeton or anything

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.170
 like that That might require a degree that is specific to that type

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.120
 of study. I'm sure there are others, too, but that's the best example

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.080
 and come up with
