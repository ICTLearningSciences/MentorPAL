Generally, you always have the choice to live off base if you want to.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.450
 Um, the types of base housing are different. So in San Diego, there

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.750
 are neighborhoods in San Diego that air considered military housing.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.050
 There's very little actual on base housing in the particular basis

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.350
 around the area. That's pretty normal, I would say. Most people live

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.650
 out in town anyway, Um, just because of the options they have.
