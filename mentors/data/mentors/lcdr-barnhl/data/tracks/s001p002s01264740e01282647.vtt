00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.060
There's not one type of sailor that causes problems. Um, but, you know,

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.280
 there there are different when they're they're different types. Uh,

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.490
 cynicism is a way of life in the military. Uh, every just about every

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.710
 military member you meet has a more cynical view of their organization.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.920
 That's probably what they came into the military with. This

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.140
 becomes more a problem when it's just when it's kind of worn on a person's

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.350
 sleeve. Um, constantly negative, uh, always has some negative

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.560
 to say about what they're doing. Um, and this can have a detrimental

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.780
 impact on on on the team members. Like I said, this is not the only

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.990
 type of person, but it it is one. Um, and you have to be clear right

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.210
 away for those people that that type of behavior is not gonna be

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.420
 acceptable. How do you do that? Uh, well, there's there. There's not

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.630
 necessarily one good answer. Um, but you also might not have a choice

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.850
 to have them on their team. You're gonna have folks that are very,

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.060
 very good at their job. Skill wise. But I have very bad attitudes.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.280
 Thing happens quite a bit. I've seen it plenty of times. Um but you

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.490
 need thio. You you need to find a way to get to them to connect with

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.710
 them so they don't have a negative impact on the people around them.
