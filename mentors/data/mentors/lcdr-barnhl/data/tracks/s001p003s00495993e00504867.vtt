I don't think that managing a career and family is any different inside

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.680
 the military is outside. I think the stressors air more because of

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:17.100
 the the deployments that you end up on in the time spent away. But

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.510
 thoughts on how to manage it are pretty similar. I would say you have

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.930
 to think further head probably because you know the deployments are

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.340
 going to come. And you gotta think about how you're going to anticipate

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.760
 how you're how you can help your family before these deployments

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.170
 occur. Um, the theat of doing that, I think, goes a long way to alleviate

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.590
 family stress and perhaps resentment, too.
