00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.730
when given any situation, the most important thing you can do Thio kind

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.600
 of assess it, and how you should handle is to kind of realize you

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.480
 and your team's part in that situation. There's an inclination to think

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.360
 about the overall implications of what that situation means, and

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.230
 sometimes that can lead you to think about things that are outside

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.110
 your purview. Um, if you do that, then you can easily get overwhelmed

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.990
 with this situation and trying to think of answers to problems that

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.870
 aren't being asked. Asked about uh, so understanding where you fit

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.740
 in that situation where your team fits in that situation can help bound

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.620
 to the problem so that you can deal with something a little more

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.500
 tractable. Let other people deal with the three other aspects you

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.370
 need to be able to deal with your at your particular responsibility

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.250
 as it applies to that situation.
