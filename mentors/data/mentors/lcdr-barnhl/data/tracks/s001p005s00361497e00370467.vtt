00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.370
one of the best organizations, informal organizations that has been a

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.890
 help to my family has been the military, various military spouse clubs

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.400
 that have been resident at my my commands. Um, they provide a lot

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.920
 of heads up on what's going on in the community before you get there.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.440

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.030
 willing to that that supports the sailors while our the sailors

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.550
 families while the sailors might be deployed.
