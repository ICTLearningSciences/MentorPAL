If you're married before you deploy, you need to think about a little,

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.230
 uh, a living will. Um, you need thio. Anything that you know your spouse

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.920
 will have trouble with doing by themselves. Trying to make it

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.610
 any way you could make that easier for them is very important. You remember

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.300
 when you deploy, you're typically going to a ship, and if you

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.990
 forget something, someone can send it to you. So it's not terribly.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.690
 It's not a terrible thing, if you for forget something. But it's more

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.380
 of what will cause you. Stress is if something occurs back home

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.070
 that you have that you could have controlled, but you don't have anything

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.760
 place to control it then. So that's what you need to focus on

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.450
 ensuring your family as well set up and taking care of before you leave

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.140
 home as faras stuff taking with you on deployment that you'll learn

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.830
 about that when you talk with your fellow jails and that shouldn't

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.520
 be too much of a stressor
