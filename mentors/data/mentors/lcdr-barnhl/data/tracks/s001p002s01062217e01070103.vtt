00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.400
taking carrier people is first and foremost the job of a leader. I think

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.950
 I'm pretty good at that. Uh, in the way I do that is trying to be

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.500
 empathetic to a to a person's situation. I've always been that way

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.060
 s so even though I'm very direct and how I talked with people and handle

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.610
 situations, empathy is a key part of my own personality that I

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.160
 think lends itself well to until the way I lied. And I would recommend

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.710
 folks try to imitate that if they can.
