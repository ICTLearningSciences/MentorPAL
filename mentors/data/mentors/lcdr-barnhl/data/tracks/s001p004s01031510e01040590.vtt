00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.760
While I think you have to be intentional about ensuring that you're growing

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.670
 and developing, you don't have to. You don't necessarily have

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.570
 to seek a moment each day to do it. A lot of times exposure you get

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.480
 at work in the military is enough to continue your development. But

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.390
 what you need to d'oh! I really do feel like this is in need. You have

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.300
 to be humble and you have to be introspective and think about how

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.200
 you're doing things. And if you see a better way of doing it than adopt

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.110
 that, you know there's if they're only a few situations in life

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.020
 where you can plagiarize and this is definitely one of them, it might

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.930
 work for you. It might not, but he should at least be humble enough

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.830
 to realize that there are better way things, better ways of doing

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.740
 things and that it is okay for you to adopt those ways, even if it

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.650
 feels a little unnatural.
