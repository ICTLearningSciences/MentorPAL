00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.750
like any job, you have to spend some of your free time learning how to

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.650
 do new things. It's inevitable. If you only rely on the time that's

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.550
 at work. It's just you're never gonna be as good as you could be. And

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.450
 oftentimes you might even fail after. That's kind of like school.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.350
 You have to take home work home, and you have to practice in order

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.250
 to get better. What you're doing this aviation is, is a similar thing

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.150
 there plenty of times where I've had to take work home with me to

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.050
 study or stay late at the office in order to study because I couldn't

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.950
 take it home.
