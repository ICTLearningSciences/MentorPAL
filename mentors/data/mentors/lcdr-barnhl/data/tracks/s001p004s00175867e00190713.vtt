00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.740
The nature of my personality lends itself to doing things that are approved

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.630
 of by any community. I'd say so not sure my career path would

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.520
 have changed. One thing I would have wanted to know, though, is to be

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.410
 a bit more is to have a bit more information on the alternatives going

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.300
 off the career path because there's some very good ones on and

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.190
 they're not. They're not necessarily. They're not bad, in fact, a very

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:35.080
 good. But they're just probably good in a more personal way for your

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.970
 own personal gain. And it was always there's always, you know, when

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.860
 when these these types of options were discussed, they they were

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.750
 always given with the caveat, Will This is bad for your career or something

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.640
 like that. So I was always reticent to even consider them.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.530
 But looking back, there are some very interesting opportunities that

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.420
 I think would have been very beneficial. Um, now my have lights. If

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.310
 I wasn't as worried about staying on the career path
