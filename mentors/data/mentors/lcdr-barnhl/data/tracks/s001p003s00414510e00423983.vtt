00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.060
because you're responsible for other people. It's automatically gonna

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.270
 change how you how you work, how you live, what you're thinking about

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.480
 and how much you travel. Um, you are pretty much accessible all the

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.690
 time because if someone in your chain of command does something wrong,

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.900
 you're gonna hear about it, and then you're going to need to elevate

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.110
 elevate that information when necessary. Uh, how much travel you

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.320
 do will certainly depend on you know what your responsibilities are?

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.530
 I've been in situations where I have had to travel much at all in

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.740
 other situations where I did, um, other times, You know, if you're

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.950
 if you're getting ready for deployment, you're pretty much all traveling.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.160
 So, uh, being a leader doesn't necessarily auto doesn't automatically

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.370
 mean you're going to do more traveling than not, but it certainly

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.580
 could lead to that
