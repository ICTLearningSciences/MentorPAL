00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.690
if you have a hard time listening Two people, whether their peers or subordinates

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.530
 or even superiors. Hopefully, that's not the case. Um, you

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.370
 know, if you have the luxury of it, one thing you could potentially

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.200
 do you have someone come with you or be with you to listen to these

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.040
 things? Uh, so let's say if a subordinate has a problem, they want

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.880
 to come to you to talk about it. Uh, you might want to bring in your

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.720
 chief for senior chief or whoever works for in that capacity toe.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.560
 Listen as well. And then maybe you can give the subordinate good answer

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.400
 to begin with. But at least you have someone else who is listening

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.230
 that can give you a different perspective on, Really, Perhaps maybe

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.070
 to understand what they're saying Or, you know, they could put a

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.910
 different framework or something like that. Said it could be one strategy

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.750
 that could help you
