00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.360
you become a better team member by continually being part of a team not

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.870
 being afraid to be a part of a team and not seeing the team as a group

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.380
 of individuals, and you're all working towards the same goal. Oftentimes,

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.890
 one of one of the problems that I always had was like, you

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.400
 know, I didn't get in a group, that we were supposed to be working

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.910
 together, and I feel the need to potentially established own, you know,

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.420
 my my own. Ah, uh, perhaps not dominance. But you know, my position

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.930
 of authority amongst that group, whether they were appears their

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.440
 subordinates, um, is important to realize that that's not necessary.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.950
 You know, your your strengths will come out in the wash. Yeah, as

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.460
 you as you guys start getting through, whatever task you're trying

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.970
 to accomplish, people will notice your strengths. You need to be assertive

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.480
 and what you can and can't do. But there doesn't need to be a

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.990
 situation where you're simply demanding that you be in charge of any

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.500
 one particular thing because you think you're the best at it is that

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.010
 very well may not be the case
