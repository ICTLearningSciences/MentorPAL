00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.840
Mount travel required for someone like me. I hate to say it, but is dependent

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.820
 on where your s o If you're When I was on my junior officer

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.810
 short tour, I did a fair amount of travel, but they're attracting folks

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.790
 that traveled more than me. I would say I would make three or four

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.780
 work trips a year in that particular capacity if I'm in an operational

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.760
 squadron than a lot of times, the types of training you did dictated

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.750
 how much you had to travel. So we and one of the squadrons I

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.730
 was in we did, ah, yearly trip from Atsugi, Japan, which is where we're

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.720
 based down to Okinawa because that's where we could do the training

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.700
 we needed. Then we'll stay about two or three weeks down there,

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.690
 uh, in in San Diego when I was a department head With that squadron,

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.670
 we made probably 3223 trips a year out El Centro, California, which

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.660
 is not far away from San Diego, but it's still 110 miles in the distance

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.640
 from your family did a couple times a year. And then we also had

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.630
 Thio travel up Thio Point, Magoo and Ventura County, California because

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.610
 that's where we could fly drones. Um, so all told, I'd say I

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.600
 made about five thio six work trips a year while in an operational squadron

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.580
 not being deployed. That's very dependent on the type of squad

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.570
 on your end. Jet Squadron travel much more for training than helicopter

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.550
 strong squatters.
