00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.000
the resource is your rely on their provided by the navy, uh, are broad

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.140
 spectrum. Uh, there's not one that's necessarily better than another.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.290
 But what I would say is that if you have a general question about

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.430
 the Navy, whether you're talking about military pay or you're talking

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.580
 about B H in a location where you're trying to get access to, you

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.730
 know, maybe healthcare type questions military One source, which is

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.870
 not directly part of the big Navy apparatus, usually kind of collates

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.020
 an aggregate. This information usually ends up being a one stop shop

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.170
 for at least pointing you in the right direction of where you need

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.310
 to go for for this type of thing. Usually we need as a jail you're

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.460
 not exactly looking for big Navy. Resource is, it just doesn't happen

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.600
 too much. But there that's a good website to go to. A few if you

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.750
 need it
