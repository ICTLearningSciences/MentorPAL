00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.470
your relationship with your reporting. Seniors needs to be professional,

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.090
 but in the same time, somewhat personal. Uh, you need to be ready

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.710
 to tell them that you disagree with them. That doesn't mean they're

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.340
 gonna take your side or agree with you, but they need to know that

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.960
 perspective. It's the same reason why you need to have an open relationship

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.580
 with your subordinates. What? Now? You know, you might need

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.200
 to respect the fact that your superior is not gonna listen to what you

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.820
 had to say. But you need to be willing to do it. You need to be willing

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.440
 to say that. You disagree, Even if you know that they aren't

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.060
 gonna take it. That is easier, more easily said than done. Um, but that

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.690
 is it is an important point. We need to as leaders, we should be

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.310
 surrounding ourselves with people that offer us perspective that offer

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.930
 us advice. And sometimes that advice is much different than what

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.550
 we think should happen
