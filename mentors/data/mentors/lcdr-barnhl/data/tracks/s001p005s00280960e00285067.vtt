if a sailor is being affected by their grief on their duties. Number one,

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.120
 this shouldn't. If you have known about this situation, as in the

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.250
 event that is causing the grief before anything happens, you should

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.390
 anticipate that this could be a problem. Talk with urine CEOs and

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.520
 see what plan of action is appropriate for that person. Second, and

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.650
 is just in general be sensitive to that person's mentality. They're

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.790
 going through something that you perhaps cannot grasp. Uh, so it's important

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.920
 that you have enough sensitivity to realize that.
