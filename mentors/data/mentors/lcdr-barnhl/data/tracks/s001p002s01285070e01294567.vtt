00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.350
There are a number of ways to get to the root of a problem when you're

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.840
 dealing with your team members. Um, one way to do it if you're trying

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.340
 to address something specific with that team member is avoid making

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.840
 them defensive as any way you can. It doesn't mean be meek or anything

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.340
 like that, but maybe approach the problem in directly. Uh, don't

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.830
 tell them you're doing a terrible job. Uh, what you might be able

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:39.330
 to do is Tottenham positively about what something they're doing. Then

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.830
 discuss the thing they need to fix on. Explain why two. Um, it was

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:50.320
 just one mechanism that could be used. Thio. Help get to the root

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.820
 problem if if someone is causing an issue with your team.
