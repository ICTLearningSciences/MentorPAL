There's not something specific that you need to know about yourself. Um,

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.130
 you do need to understand your personality. You need to understand

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.770
 the flaws in your personality, and you need to be willing to handle

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.410
 those flaws effectively. That's very difficult to do because we're

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.050
 naturally inclined to not see flaws in ourselves or at least not act

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.690
 on them, um, to fix them. I mean, so I think, generally speaking,

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.330
 and there's only a general answer. This is like realizing that there

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.970
 are flaws in your personality and being able to pick them out. I would

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.610
 say it's more effect. The question should necessarily be What do

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.250
 you need to know about yourself? Um, but how more of how to directly,

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.890
 uh, deal with the flaws in your personality and a way to do that

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.530
 is basically, have someone that you trust with you. They can point out

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.170
 those flaws on that could be any trusted subordinate or appear, or

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.810
 the tried and true your superiors telling you that you're just plain

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.450
 wrong
