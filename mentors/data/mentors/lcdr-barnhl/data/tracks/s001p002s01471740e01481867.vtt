00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.560
folks tried from the Navy from all for all different reasons. There's

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.280
 not one that you can put your finger on. Some folks are tired of the

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.990
 operational tempo. Some folks are just just want to use. The Navy gets

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.700
 a skill set, and perhaps she's the g I bill after the fact, and

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.420
 that's totally okay. Let's be clear. There's nothing wrong with leaving

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.130
 the Navy. There's nothing wrong with leaving military service. Not

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.840
 every person needs to be a career sailor, soldier, marine or airman.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.550
 It would be a problem if that was the case, huh? Some people just

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.270
 get tired. Sometimes. A family situation is tthe e drives, leaving

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.980
 the service. You need stability for your Children. Some people are

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.690
 fed up with the general. The mentality of the military service, the

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.410
 conformity of that's required to be in the military. Um, all of that

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.120
 is totally acceptable, and it should not be frowned upon
