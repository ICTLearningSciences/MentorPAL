00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.330
one way you could help morale when things kind of taking term from the

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.800
 worst is just is being the the kind of stoic, the stoic leader that

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.280
 made that calls for that situation? Um, you need thio show a sense

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.760
 of purpose, even if it's not what you personally want. You can't have

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.240
 to put your feelings aside sometimes. Uh, but at the same time, one

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.710
 thing you do you just check on people. How they doing after you? After

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.190
 you give him bad news, you make sure you're very intent about,

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.670
 uh about seeing health, folks you're doing be present. Show them that

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.150
 this is mean in a weird way, showing that you know, you're not. I

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.620
 mean, you're not happy about it either. Perhaps. But at the same time,

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.100
 maybe don't be vocal about it that way. You know it? Yeah. You have

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.580
 to stay out to see what we all have to stay out to sea. We're all

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.060
 in this together, in a way, trying to two and reinforce the camaraderie

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.530
 that hopefully you've been building over that particular period

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.010
 of time.
