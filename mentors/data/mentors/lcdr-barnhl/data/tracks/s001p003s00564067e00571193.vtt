Staying in touch with family at while you're deployed is not terribly

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.780
 hard. There's email generally, so you don't and you have journal access

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.250
 to it almost all the time. They do have phones on ships that you

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.710
 can sometimes dial out, but it's not terribly convenient. And the delay

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.180
 is is is noticeable. When you're talking to them. Eso it's ah,

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.640
 it's a uh that's not necessarily reliable, but there are plenty of ways

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.110
 to keep in touch email being the most prevalent.
