if I'm fatigued at work, which is often for naval officers in general.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.900
 Sometimes you gotta fight through it, and it's nice strength. It's

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.920
 not like it's not as if it's a weakness to be fatigued. Sometimes things

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.940
 just need to get done, and there's not really any other choice,

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.970
 but just to move past it. If you cannot all possible, you need to listen

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.990
 to your doctors and you tell you how much sleep you should get,

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.010
 so you can kind of avoid those things. But life oftentimes doesn't

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.030
 allow that, and especially as a pilot but in other communities to you'll

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.060
 find you have an erratic, skeet sleep schedule, so you really

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.080
 just do the best you can to get to sleep you need.
