00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.590
when you first get into the military, he shouldn't really be thinking

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.330
 about retirement. But it's not a bad thing to think about early on.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.070
 The reason I'd say you shouldn't need to be thinking about it when you

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.800
 first get it is because you got other things to worry about. Don't

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.540
 worry about getting qualified. You gotta worry about just other things

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.280
 related to your actual career. I think one mistake I made when

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.020
 I was younger, I was always looking forward to the next thing instead

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.760
 of really enjoying what I was doing right at the moment. While retirement

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.500
 is certainly a consideration, I that should be thought about

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.230
 well in advance. Um, you don't need to be thinking about it right away.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.970
 They'll be certain milestone points in your career that will drive

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.710
 you to think about whether you should stay in or get out
