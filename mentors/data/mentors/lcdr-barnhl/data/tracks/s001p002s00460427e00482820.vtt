00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.810
There are a number of experiences that I've had that that Yeah, illuminates

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.780
 Navy culture, huh? And they're ever present. You know, it's not

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.740
 just one thing that occurred. I can think back Thio when I was a junior

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.700
 officer, my first command and we every time someone would leave,

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.670
 we would have what's called a hail on bail. So if new people were

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.630
 coming in way, say we'd hail them say, Well, essentially welcome, make

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.590
 fun of them a little. And then the folks for the folks that were

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.550
 leaving, we'd make a big deal of sending them off. It wasn't our particular

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.520
 method of doing it wasn't like this. This formal thing, we

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.480
 were right essentially a we call scroll, which is basically we'd write

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.440
 about the person experience in a very humorous way. At least we try

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.410
 to make it as humorous as possible, and along the way, weed we allow

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.370
 a fair amount of collateral damage of other people in the squadron

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.330
 usually was a way to make fun of people, but also at the same time

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.300
 show appreciation for what a person has done, Uh, that that type of

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.260
 thing. I'm not so sure that would particularly go very well and in

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.220
 civilian life or in a private sector. But because of the the shared

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.190
 experience aspect of the military, that does seem to go a long way.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.150
 Um, it makes people feel good, and it shows an appreciation in a way

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.110
 that, you know, some folks just don't some folks in the private sector

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.080
 and just might not understand we did. We did a number of those

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.040
 when I was. Since I've been in my community, The underlying thing about

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.000
 it is that you're always showing appreciation for the people you

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.960
 work with. You appreciate the hard work they put in. You appreciate

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.930
 the time you spent with him whether it was by counsel or just by their

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.890
 very, very their skill set. Um, I thought that was always very important,

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.850
 and and incidentally, it's something that I think is kind

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.820
 of gone by the wayside, as times have changed in perspective has changed
