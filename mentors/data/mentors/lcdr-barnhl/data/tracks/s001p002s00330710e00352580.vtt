00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.800
it's hard to get feedback from from senior officers. Sometimes, um, the

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.760
 sometimes It's not in the senior officers nature to give feedback.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.710
 Sometimes they want to keep their cards close so that they said that

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.660
 the subordinate doesn't know what what they're doing. I think there's

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.620
 an intrinsic fear that if a subordinate is given is told very directly

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.570
 how they're doing, they will. They will failed to perform. But

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.530
 really, I think comes down how this criticism or feedback is presented.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.480
 We all learn methods to do this, and the most basic one that I

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.430
 know of is say, you're doing really well at this. You need to work

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.390
 on this, but you're also doing really well at this, so you be flush

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.340
 with praise while also giving critique on where someone could do better.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.290
 But as this from a subordinate standpoint, you have to demand feedback.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.250
 You have to you have to let in a respectful way. You have to

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.200
 know, or you have to let your son you know that you want feedback.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.150
 It's important to you. It's it's how you grow. In my last command,

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.110
 I received several fitness reports that said You're doing a great job.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.060
 And the fertile debrief was similar in a statement. I had to ask

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.010
 them directly to give me to tell me where I can improve to help help

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.970
 the command do better. And one time there was not. I thought that was

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.920
 supremely unhelpful. Uh, I specifically brought this up not that

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.880
 particular time, but, uh, to one of my future bosses and explaining

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.830
 that we need feedback. We need to know what's wrong with how we can

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.780
 do better. And it did get better with the with the next commanding officer,

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.740
 but showing your commanding officer or your boss, whoever it

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.690
 is that you're interested in feedback that you want to know how you

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.640
 can get better, that you're not afraid of what they might say about

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.600
 you, you know, shows strength. But that's important. You have to be

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.550
 clear about that. That's what you want.
