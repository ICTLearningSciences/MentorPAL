The most challenging part about being a naval officer is the interaction

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.630
 with the different types of people, which, incidentally, is one of

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.520
 the best parts of the job, too. You have to learn how to motivate

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.410
 people, and you have to. I also realized that some folks you're you're

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.300
 just not gonna be able to reach. It's not your fault, but it is one

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.200
 of the biggest challenges you can. You can. You'll come across because

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.090
 if you can't motivate somebody, if you can get someone to continue

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.980
 or go down a path that you think they should go down, it would

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.870
 be positive. For them, it feels like a failure. The reality is it's

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.760
 really not a failure. It's just it's just they, perhaps or not willing.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.650
 T o do what you think they should do, and that's okay.
