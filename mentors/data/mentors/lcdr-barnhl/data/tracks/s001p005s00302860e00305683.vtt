00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.500
It's very difficult to discern true suicidal behavior versus just having

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.140
 a difficult period of time. But what I would say is that if someone

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.790
 is consistently upset or seems down, they should be engaged. It doesn't

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.430
 matter if you think they're suicidal or not, that that is just

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.080
 a proper human thing to do.
