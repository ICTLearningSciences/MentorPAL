I think there's always worries about your future when it comes to, uh,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.630
 the Naval professional military all one of the things we don't give

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.020
 enough credit two is the effect of timing on your career. Timing has

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.410
 a huge part to play when it comes to career career promotion. You

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.800
 know most people can make it to lieutenant lieutenant commander without

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.190
 much trouble. But at that point there is an extreme filtering process

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.580
 that occurs and you see you lose, you know, losing a lot of people,

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.970
 Um, because they may not have screened for command because there's

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.360
 only so many command slots. And a lot of times that could be due

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.750
 to effect of timing. There's more detailed answer with regard to that

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.140
 that you'll learn about as you experienced the effect of detail

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.530
 ing. Uh, but, uh, that's ends up being a pretty big deal when there's

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.920
 nothing you can control over it, either.
