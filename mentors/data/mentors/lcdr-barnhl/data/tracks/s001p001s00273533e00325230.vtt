00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.730
So when I goto, my typical day at work was different, depending on whether

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.600
 I was at shore or on a C tour, typically in the Navy, short tours

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.480
 or times of relaxation. In some ways she performed, you still have

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.360
 responsibilities, but that the general idea is that you worked hard

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.230
 at sea and now we're gonna give you a job that's not quite as demanding.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.110
 And perhaps you'd go home every night, starting with at in a

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.990
 deployable squadron. There was always something that needed to be done,

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.860
 and it seemed to always need to be done in a hurry. So you get to

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.740
 work. I never found a reason that I absolutely had to be at work before

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.610
 seven, maybe 7 30 That's one of the joys of being in the aviation

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.490
 community. Uh, partially. I would kind of walk around, see what

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.370
 was see what was going on. And this is regardless of what type of role

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.240
 I had, uh, see what was going on. See, what if anything, needed my

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.120
 attention immediately upon arrival, and then I would probably sit

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.000
 down at my desk and check check some emails just to see who was in dire

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.870
 need of our service is if I did not. If I had a flight to prepare

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.750
 for, then I would show up pretty early. Usually if I had any. If I

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.630
 had a flight, I would show up at least two hours before our brief time

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.500
 to ensure that I, uh, was probably prepared. Not everyone felt that

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.380
 way, but this was my routine. Um, we would typically have a flight

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.260
 brief about two hours before we were going to take off, depending

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.130
 on the type of flight we were doing on then. Then we would do all the

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.010
 required pre flight routine, which was checking out their craft looking

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.890
 and seeing if there's any maintenance issues that we need that

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.760
 needed to be taken care of. Uh And then we'd start up and go fly for

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.640
 about three hours and then come back and often times if you had a

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.510
 flight. That total routine took up a good six hours your days trying

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.390
 to get anything done around That was kind of difficult. And like I

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.270
 said, it didn't matter if you were a junior officer, a department head

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.140
 or anything like that. That's just the nature of the aviation game,

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.020
 Um, and the focus of of deploy of in a deplorable squatters, always

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.900
 being ready to deploy or getting somebody ready to deploy or waiting

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.770
 for someone to get home and figuring out how you're going to incorporate

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.650
 those people that particular deployed detachment back into

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.530
 the squadron like any. Like any situation. If someone's gone for a

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.400
 while and they come back, there's some growing pains, and you need to

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.280
 figure out how to how to kind of figure that how to figure that out.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.160
 So there's a lot of dealing with that. As a department head, we had

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.030
 to keep track of all the flight hours and all the qualifications

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.910
 required, because a person's qualifications would dictate how deployable

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.780
 they were. And the goal of every junior officer, in my opinion,

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.660
 is to be as deplorable as possible, because if you are not deployable,

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.540
 that someone else has to pick up the slack. So figuring that type

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.410
 of stuff out was was pretty would occupied a lot of my attention throughout

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.290
 a typical day. Usually I could, in a deployable squadron,

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.170
 I could, you know, leave by six or seven PM if I wasn't flying but a

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.040
 lot of times because of my level of qualification, I was flying it

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.920
 up until 2 a.m. Andi, come back. If I was flying till 2 a.m. That means

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.800
 that did not have to come into squad until the afternoon, Um, when

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.670
 I was on shore tour. The responsibility is just different. So I was

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.550
 responsible for training aviators and what we term advanced tactics.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.430
 And it was not a typical short tour because there were a lot of

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.300
 demands on me. So when I said before about, you know is usually kind

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:24.180
 of a reprieve? Not so when I was in Fallon, Nevada, Now that and that

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.060
 it was because I was training people all the time. And I was either

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.930
 individual individual being trained or air wings or groups that were

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.810
 getting ready to deploy being trained and because it's pretty much

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.680
 a revolving door of where of people coming in and out to be trained,

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.560
 it required a lot of our time. Hours were erratic, and it was it

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.440
 was very, very challenging. So in that particular situation, I was

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.310
 still get there around seven or eight o'clock in the morning, and I'd

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.190
 be done if no one was there around five. Otherwise I could be done

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.070
 between seven o'clock or in the evening, too. 2 a.m. Some nights, it

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.940
 just it just depended. And then, at the same time Ellis had had to

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.820
 do flying on my short tour as well.
