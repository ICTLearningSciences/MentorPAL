00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.770
so the opportunity to do transfer between communities or if or even get

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.680
 out of the Navy. Her vast, usually in order to get out of the Navy

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.600
 is based on a a timeline which you agreed upon upon entering or might

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.520
 be based on a sea of bonus or son education and educational opportunity

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.440
 that you said that you wanted to take. And then you have to pay

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.350
 some time back. But, uh, when you say changing careers, I'm thinking

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.270
 maybe you you want to get out of the Navy. But inside the Navy,

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.190
 if you want to transfer different to different community, those opportunities

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.110
 exist. What I will say is that the further Ugo in one community,

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.020
 the more difficult it may be to transfer out of it because you

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.940
 have to think in terms of how the folks that the personnel command

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.860
 see you, they're seeing you a CZ as a as a tool as a CZ in a utilitarian

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.780
 type of mode, um, they need to use you. And if they let you transfer

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.690
 over, then they've lost that tool that they've got. They might

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.610
 otherwise think they've had all turn also along with that, like the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.530
 further you go in the career, the longer you're in, especially the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.450
 closer you are to retirement. If you do decide to stay in that long,

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.360
 they might ask, Why would we let this person transferred to a new

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.280
 field? If he's just going to get out and say 45 years, that could be

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.200
 one consideration. However, with all that said, there plenty of opportunities

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.120
 to transfer, you can always try and transfer. There are repercussions.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.030
 Perhaps, as in you know, if someone knows that you want

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.950
 to move to a different field, that might suggest to them that you're

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.870
 not interested in continuing along a typical career path in the field,

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.790
 you're already in S O that might sacrifice some of your career

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.700
 potential if you end up not getting selected for that other other position.
