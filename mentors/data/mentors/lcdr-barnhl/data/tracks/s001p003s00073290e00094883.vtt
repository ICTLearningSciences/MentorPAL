00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.880
without a doubt, The biggest failure I ever had was when I was in a helicopter

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.920
 crash in 2011. We crash in your craft, and it was totally our

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.950
 fault. We thought we were doing everything right. And turns out we

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.990
 messed up one calculation. And when we did that, we had a false perception

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.020
 of reality. Essentially, Um, so unfortunately, no one died.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.060
 We all walked away, but it was a very humbling experience. A lot of

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.090
 the times when you see people make mistakes in your career field and

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.130
 doesn't matter if you're in the military or not, I think you your

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.160
 initial responses. How could that person possibly have done that? That

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.190
 seems so silly and stupid. But the reality is we're all walking on

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.230
 a very fine line of failure and success, and we all will experience

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.260
 failure sometime during our career. Feels it might not be as extreme

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.300
 as as that as crashing an aircraft, but it will happen and only thing

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.330
 you can do is learn from it. The thing I learned from it was that

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.370
 is just basically what I said. Failure is a natural part of any career.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.400
 It's going to happen, you need to be humble through it. If you're

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.440
 not humble, then you can't learn from it. And that's That's the

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.470
 on Lee. That's one of those. If nothing else. That's the good you can

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.500
 take from a really bad situation. The other good. Another good you

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.540
 can take from it is that it allows you perspective on other people's

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.570
 failures. It is very important, Uh, failure, as I said, is going

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.610
 to happen is gonna happen in your unit and probably the people that

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.640
 work for you. We're gonna fail and you're gonna learn, need to learn

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.680
 how to deal with their failure, especially when it impacts you. If

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.710
 you cannot perhaps show mercy or you realize that it's not a systemic

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.750
 failure, Uh, you know, you got to realize that maybe they can learn

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.780
 from it and be better than they are right now.
