you can't enforce any policy code. Uh, by maintaining standards yourself

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:14.750
 as the leader, uh, he can also be very direct about it. Say, this

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.700
 is the way things were gonna be. Um, but if you exemplify the standard,

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:28.650
 then people will follow you. There are other aspects that come

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.600
 into play there. Are you relatable, Ari? Do you get along with your

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.550
 with your subordinates? Are you fair? Um but I would say that if you

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:49.500
 basic very basic, if you maintain the standard and people are required

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.450
 to follow you by virtue of your position, they probably will.
