00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.890
I wouldn't say there's a particular situation. What I would say is there

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.930
 specific cultures that can lead to this? The If the command culture

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.970
 is not specifically highlighting the the, uh, sexual harassment and

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:25.000
 the fact that will not be accepted, then I think you will likely

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.040
 it will be more likelihood of it happening in a particular command.
