00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.870
there's no one specific or two specific things that makes a good leader.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.900
 A leader is built by their experience. There are some people who

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.920
 are inclined to leadership. I think, uh, their personality lends itself

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.940
 to it. But even those people, if they don't have the experience,

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:30.960
 then oftentimes they can't put problems in decisions into appropriate

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.990
 perspective. So there's not any really one thing or two things or

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:43.010
 you small things that make one leader great and another not or one

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:49.030
 leader great. Another good. It's how you use your experiences, Thio

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:55.060
 relate to your subordinates and lead your subordinates and make decisions

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:01.080
 that affect your subordinates.
