00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.610
vision that I and that I find or have to make on a daily basis is usually

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:12.360
 related to a a broader aspect. So my my example would be being the

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.120
 operations officer in the squadron and putting out a flight schedule

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.870
 each day. That flight schedule was in itself a way to manage people

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:29.630
 getting in the air so they would have experience and getting qualifications.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.380
 Um, so who to put in the air how to do it? What things?

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.140
 That what type of flights They should be flying. Um was really, uh,

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.890
 for a broader purpose of making sure the people at ours and training

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.650
 that they that they needed.
