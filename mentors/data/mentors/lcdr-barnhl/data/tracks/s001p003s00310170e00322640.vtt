00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.830
There isn't any particular crime that is committed relative related to

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.810
 the profession. That, I would say needs to be watched for the things

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:15.800
 that do need to be watched for our use of things like you could use

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.780
 of alcohol, sexual abuse, hazing, which, in and of themselves, they're

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.760
 not allowed. And some of those certainly would be classified as

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.740
 crimes. But others are more like behaviors. Um, if there is any, uh,

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.730
 any evidence that sexual abuse, assault harassment is going on, that

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.710
 needs to be stopped immediately, and it needs to be elevated immediately

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.690
 because the longer languishes the worst it's gonna be for everybody.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.670
 And the other part, it's not just about and this is more important,

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.660
 it's not just about ensuring the command. Uh, the command record

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.640
 is kept clean, but more important for the individual that's experiencing

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.620
 that, Uh, because if someone, if one person is experiencing

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.600
 that, then that means there's potential for more. And while it's

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.590
 tragic that people do experience that type of thing once that happens,

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.570
 there's not much you can do about other. Stop it immediately and

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.550
 prevent it from happening again. Okay,
