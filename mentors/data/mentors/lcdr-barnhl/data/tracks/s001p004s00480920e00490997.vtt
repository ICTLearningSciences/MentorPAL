00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.520
the people that have influenced me the most. Generally, my peers, I've

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.200
 had some really good superior mentors. But there are two individuals

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.870
 specifically that I worked with is a department head that I gained

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.550
 valuable insights from. I think you will find that your peers give

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.220
 you the greatest insights on to you and how you should lead, because

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.900
 you get to observe how they're going to do it, and then you can. If

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.570
 you're willing and humble enough, you can implement their techniques

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.250
 into yours. And if those were good, you can just become what you could

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.920
 be a much better leader than you might already be. Three important

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.600
 thing about that is to be humble and observe and listen and realize

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.270
 that you don't have all the answers on the people around you, even

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.950
 if they're your peers. And even if their subordinates can show you

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.620
 how to lead people in the military
