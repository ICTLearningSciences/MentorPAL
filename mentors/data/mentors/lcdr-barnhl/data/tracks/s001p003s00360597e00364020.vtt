00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.130
one of the things about the military and being an officer in general is

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.410
 that you don't get that you don't necessarily get the choice of what

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.690
 you are told to do or not do. Um, I've had to do a lot of things

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.970
 I didn't want to dio that didn't make it a bad thing to do. I just didn't

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.240
 particularly want to do it. But the only option I had was to complete

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.520
 the job, and I did that. You'll find yourself in that to have

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.800
 a situation many times. Sometimes it is probably best to just put

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.080
 your head down and get the job done.
