00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.430
the types of problems range from personal problems of your sailors to

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:12.020
 things going wrong in the squatter, and I have experienced all types

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.600
 of things that you could not even think of. And if I told you all of

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.180
 them, you would not believe that they're necessarily true. However,

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.770
 there are a few good examples of what you might deal with first the

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.350
 personal problems, namely of your sailors. Like any group, your sailors

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.940
 are composed of a rep originally representative cross section

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.520
 of society. So as good as they are, they're going to make mistakes and

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.100
 do things that are questionable. Sometimes we've I've been involved

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.690
 with figuring out how we're going to deal with a sailor who got a

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.270
 d. Y with a 0.21 b a. C. Um, I've also had to deal with the problems

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.850
 of on aircraft. Uh, that dropped a cargo load into the ocean as they

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.440
 were moving it from one ship to another. We've dealt with problems

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.020
 with, uh, with on enlisted person who decided the best way to contain

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.600
 the venom of a snakebite was to shoot office thumb. Uh, just I mean,

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.190
 the types of problems you deal with our are myriad, and you can

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.770
 never guess wth e the what the extreme spectrum of those problems would

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.360
 be. Typically, there things, they're very tractable, and you can

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.940
 you can understand the problem pretty well doesn't make it easy, but

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.520
 it's it's something you can understand. Being in a helicopter squadron,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.110
 we saw people. One of the main things we did there was move people

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.690
 and we had to move all kinds of people, and sometimes a lot of

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.270
 the time it was a last minute thing that people didn't think about.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.860
 Seemingly though they may have, uh, we had to figure out how we were

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.440
 going to get an aircraft ready to ensure that this particular admiral

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.020
 could get to the ship he needed to get Thio at any one time. Sounds

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.610
 like an easy and an easy issue to deal with, But there are a lot

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.190
 of steps involved there, and if you are, if you don't anticipate this

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.780
 problems, there's types of things, then it's gonna be much more difficult

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.360
 to deal with. But that's where experience comes in. The experience

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.940
 you gain as a junior officer and in subsequent duty stations

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.530
 regards it Sure or C tour will help prepare you to deal with the problems

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.110
 that you can't even think of today,
