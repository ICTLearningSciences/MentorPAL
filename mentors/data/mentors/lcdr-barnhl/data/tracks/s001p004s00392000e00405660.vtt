00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.240
They're different variations of advice. People give you some ex specifically

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.630
 based on your career. Other times, it's just how to better be

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.020
 a better leader. One of the better pieces of advice I I got about being

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.410
 a better leader who came during a, uh, a fitness report debrief

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.800
 that I had with the superior. I was, uh I did done a good job, and

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.200
 he was doing his job by giving me some feedback on some things I could

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.590
 work on. Uh, I'm naturally the type of person who is has a very stoic

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.980
 face. And you don't really know if I'm happier, sad unless I'm

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.370
 very overt about it. And he gave me a word of caution that you walking

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.760
 around like that as a leader can lead to uncertainty and most your

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.150
 subordinates. How you're really doing it might make you less approachable.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.540
 And that's what you don't want. You want people to be able

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.930
 to come to you and feel like they can come to you and talk to you and

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.320
 ask you questions and let you know what the problems are both professional

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.710
 and personal. Um, so while that might be a small thing What

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.100
 Well you can take that to mean is simply that you take a look at how

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.500
 you're carrying yourself. Take a look at the things that you are doing

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.890
 that might dissuade people from interacting with you. Because there's

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.280
 a leader you need those interactions. You are not alone in this

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.670
 decision making process. You need people's advice, you need people's

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.060
 input, and you want people feel comfortable giving that input, even

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.450
 if you disagree with him.
