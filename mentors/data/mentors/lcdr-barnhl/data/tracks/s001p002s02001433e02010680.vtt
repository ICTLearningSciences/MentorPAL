00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.620
There are plenty of people that I admire, and many of them I have come

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.390
 into contact with, uh, while being in the Navy. Uh, one of those was

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.160
 one of my department heads in when I was a junior officer. He was

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.930
 a fantastic leader and he gave me a lot of insight. It turns out, despite

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.700
 him, how he would have been a great commanding officer. He was

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.470
 he was passed over for command, and that was a big blow to him. But

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.240
 I always admired him for how well they handle it and how well he kept

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.010
 being a good leader even after finding out that he was the that that

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.780
 news. And I just thought, even in a perceived failure, he was still

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.550
 a fantastic leader. And that's something that I always took the

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.320
 heart.
