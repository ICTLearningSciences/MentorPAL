00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.500
you could be more efficient. How you work as a leader first by a delegation

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.140
 on being clear about what you want from your subordinates. You

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.790
 have to understand that you can't do everything as a leader you want

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.440
 to be, and sometimes you feel like you need to be. But you can't do

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.090
 it. It's impossible. So that means that you have to use the resource

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.730
 is that is the people that you have working for you to get the job

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.380
 done. Tell them what you want. Tell them what you expect the output

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.030
 to be. Not not. No way that doctors the output just like here. This

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.680
 is what I want is what I want you to look at, Uh, and tell them a

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.320
 timeframe. If you don't tell him a time frame, they won't give you.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.970
 Give it to you when you want it. That's just a fact. Be very specific

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.620
 about you when you want it. There are no doubt many other ways to

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.270
 be more efficient now in your working environment. But realizing that

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.910
 you can't do everything after you realize that delegating and being

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.560
 clear about what you want our to our three ways that you can make

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.210
 your life better
