00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.440
so the wasting your time at work is dependent on what your responsibilities

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.020
 are, which is probably pretty obvious. But he also depends on

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.610
 what point in your career you're at. So if you're a junior officer,

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.200
 especially in the aviation community, your main focus should be learning

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.780
 how to fly aircraft. And all of this is sort of related to how

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.370
 you should treat your career. In my opinion, uh, as a junior officer,

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.950
 your primary job is to learn how to fly your aircraft. Imagine in

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.540
 other communities that may be the same, I was told by my very first

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.130
 operational commanding officer, You could be one of three things. Of

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.710
 course, you could be more than one of three things, but these are the

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.300
 three things he laid out. He'd be a great aviator, which is good.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.890
 You have to be a good aviator in order to progress. You could be a

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.470
 good ground officer, and that is important, too. But when you start

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.060
 looking for jobs after your first junior officer tour, no one's going

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.650
 to say he was a great ground officer. The third thing is, you could

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.230
 be a good aviator and a good ground officer, which is probably a pretty

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.820
 good objective because then people know that you're virtually

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.400
 can do different things. But you're also good in the aircraft, and being

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.990
 in the good in the aircraft establishes a reputation. So in a long

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.580
 winded sort of way, the priory of your time at work as a junior

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.160
 officer should be spent learning how to fly aircraft and focusing on

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.750
 how to do your ground job. Well, at the same time as you proceed in

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.340
 your career, your priorities are different. You probably spend more

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.920
 time behind a desk as you doing paperwork. As you get further along,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.510
 however, you also start having to think about how the people working

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.090
 for you are doing. And that's both officer and enlisted as a junior

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.680
 officer. Your while you have responsibilities to enlisted people,

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.270
 people that are working for you, you most assuredly arm or self focused,

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.850
 I would say, but that becomes less and less of ah likelihood as

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.440
 you proceed in your career on by the time you become a department

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.030
 head and it doesn't matter what type of department head you are, whether

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.610
 you're in the service community or submarine community or aviation

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.200
 community. You're really thinking about how the people below you

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.790
 are doing both. And that has taken two ways. How, where, how well are

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.370
 they performing at their job and just how well they're doing as human

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.960
 beings, because he's poor to realize that they can be great at

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.540
 their job. But if they're, if they're having trouble either at home

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.130
 or they're getting trouble outside of work, you're gonna have to deal

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.720
 with that, too. So it is important to realize that at work you'll

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.300
 have a lot of different demands on your time, and those demands will

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.890
 change as you progress to your career.
