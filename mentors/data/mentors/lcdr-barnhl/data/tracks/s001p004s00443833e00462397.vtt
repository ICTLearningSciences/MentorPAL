00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.440
so there are a lot of different educational benefits in the Navy, and

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.040
 I would advise anybody to use those benefits to pay for whatever schooling

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.630
 you end up using. So first off, you have to remember their institutions

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.220
 in the Navy that will give you graduate credit, those being

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.820
 like the Naval War College or the Naval Postgraduate School. And

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.410
 as far as the Naval Postgraduate School is concerned, you can often

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.000
 times do a distance learning degree, and all of this is paid for. But

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.590
 you will typically oh, sometime after the completion of the program.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.190
 Alternatively, you could wait till your wait till a short tour to

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.780
 get a degree from a civilian institution and perhaps use your post

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.370
 9 11 g I bill to pay for it. If you don't do that and you get an education,

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.970
 perhaps the Navy paid for a different way. You can transfer

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.560
 the post 9 11 g. I bill benefits to your to your family members, and

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.150
 that is a very valuable asset and benefit that I would advise anybody

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.750
 to take advantage of. But if you're gonna do that, I would advise

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.340
 to do it early because they do attack on some extra time for you in

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.930
 order to transfer those benefits. However, if you already have a service

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.520
 commitment, that time will run concurrently. From what? You're

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.120
 what you're already serving. So it's not tacked onto the end of that

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.710
 service commitment. So keep that. Keep that in mind. In order to figure

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.300
 out how to transfer those benefits, you need to talk with your

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.900
 command at admin or specifically your ah, career counselor that should

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.490
 be established in your command.
