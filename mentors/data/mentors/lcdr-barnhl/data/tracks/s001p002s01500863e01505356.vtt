00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.840
you could read all the books in the world about good leadership and you

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.840
 wouldn't know enough. Uh, a lot of it is on the job training and observing

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.830
 the leaders that you like and the leaders that you didn't like

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.820
 and then adapting perhaps their leadership styles to yours, huh?

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.820
 There many definitions off what leadership should be, and I cannot

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.810
 tell you everything you need to know about being a good leader. If there's

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.800
 anything I would in part, look at your experiences and look at

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.800
 the people that lead you or the observed leading to develop your own

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.790
 leadership style.
