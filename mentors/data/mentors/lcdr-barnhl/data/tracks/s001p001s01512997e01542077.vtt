00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.190
honorable service is comes in a variety of different forms, I'd say, kind

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.530
 of like the judicial system. The initial idea is that you're going

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.860
 to serve honorably. People do that in different ways. You know, the

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.200
 default is that you're going to serve in your career and you're going

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.540
 to get out whenever you get out where there's 20 years or five

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.880
 years and you're going to get an honorable that a non arable discharge,

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.210
 that's that's the expectation. If you want to go further in that

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.550
 and think about what's what constitutes serving honorably, I think

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.890
 that is almost an unanswerable question. Other than saying, How did

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.230
 you treat the people around you? You know, our were the people you worked

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.560
 with, whether their peers, superiors or subordinates. I mean,

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.900
 did they leave you feeling as though they had a bad taste in their mouth?

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.240
 Did you help them? Did you think about ways to make their lives

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.580
 better? Did you know when it was appropriate to discipline them? You

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.910
 know, holding the standard with regard to respect and really anything

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.250
 is probably the most honorable thing you can do when that slips,

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.590
 you know, that's when you start getting into a nebulous world that

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.930
 is is not taken leads us, um, difficult situations. There are so many

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.260
 examples of specifically commanding officers, but it is not limited

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.600
 to them. I have done things that you can't believe they've done.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.940
 You know, the that person was selected to be a leader, a very small

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.280
 group of people, relatively speaking, And then they've done. They've

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.610
 decided they have made decisions and choices, or they have kept things

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.950
 hidden that they shouldn't have, and you would definitely call them

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.290
 that, in a sense, desirable. But it's likely because they made choices

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.630
 early on. That kind of skirted the rules. That's an opinion.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.960
 But I think that to be true, if you're willing to skirt, skirt the rules

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.300
 on small things, it doesn't automatically mean you're going to

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.640
 skirt the rules on big things. But it makes it maybe perhaps more likely,

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.980
 you're more comfortable with it. So simply put, serving honorably

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.310
 is maintaining a standard which can be very boring. But that's really

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.650
 how I would define it.
