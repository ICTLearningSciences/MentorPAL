00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.690
One of the common misconceptions of our field is that all pilots are created

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.530
 equal, more specifically, that all communities are created equal.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.370
 While helicopter pilots make up a significant proportion of the

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.210
 aviation community, they do not make up a significant proportion of

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.050
 aviation leadership. You can have a pretty good chance of making are

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.890
 being promoted to go six eventually, UM, which is pretty even. But

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.730
 that's because it's pretty. Is communities community specific and a

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.580
 lot of ways, If you want it in order to move past the captain to maybe

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.420
 a flag rank, you have to. You will be competing against people from

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.260
 other communities, and the folks that get the most traction with

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.100
 promotion are in the fixed wing and specifically jet communities. So

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.940
 the idea that everyone has an equal chance of becoming an admiral

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.780
 if that really does exist, I can tell you for sure that it does not
