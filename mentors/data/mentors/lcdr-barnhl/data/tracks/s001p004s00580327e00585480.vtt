00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.530
I think the most important things that will shape my future of what is

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.220
 what people think of me. Was I good, Officer? Uh, did I help people

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.900
 out on? Was that perceived across ranks? But from subordinates to superiors?

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.590
 If you're good at that, then you are. You gain. Ah, lot of

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.270
 a lot of fans. Um, you know, you can think about Dale Carnegie in his

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.960
 book How to win Friends and influence people. Oftentimes, if you're

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.640
 just a good person friendly and you engage people at their level,

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.330
 that will take you a long way to getting where you want to go. Might

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.010
 not take you all the way there. There are other things you definitely

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.700
 have to do. But if you have people rooting for you, uh, that's oftentimes

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.380
 half the battle.
