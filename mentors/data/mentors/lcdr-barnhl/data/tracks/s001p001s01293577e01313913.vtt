00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.990
changes, usually a long process. A leader can potentially changes team.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.130
 But one of the difficulties specifically about being in the military

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.270
 is that you don't have a lot of time to make change in any particular

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.410
 unit you're in. It's almost as if you're not. If you're not hitting

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.550
 the ground running as soon as you get to a unit, if you intend

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.690
 to make change, it can be very difficult to achieve that and any change

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.830
 you might have affected. We usually come after gone so you don't

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.970
 even see. You don't necessarily even see the rewards of that. If it

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.110
 does come about 18 with that said, a team can change. What's required

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.250
 is, I have to say, very dependent on the personalities you're working

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.390
 with. Some people are receptive to the change. Other people don't

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.530
 don't don't receive it too well. People like the way things were

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.670
 working, and they do not appreciate that nuts and bolts of it, though,

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.810
 if you want something to change, he demanded to change and what it

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.950
 can come down to is the subordinates following the orders that you

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.090
 put out there. If you establish what the priorities are, then they

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.230
 are typically obligated to follow them. Now your subordinates perhaps

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.370
 can can, you know, go around what you want, and there are various

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.510
 ways to do that. But it helps if you kind of explain why you're doing

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.650
 what you're doing. And usually if you're talking to your senior enlisted

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.790
 leadership and explain why you want things to change, that itself

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.930
 can go a long way to affecting change within the unit. But that's

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.070
 contingent upon your senior enlisted leadership being ready to listen

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.210
 to you.
