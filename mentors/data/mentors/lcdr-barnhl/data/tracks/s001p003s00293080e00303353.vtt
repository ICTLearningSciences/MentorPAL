00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.680
when Operation Operation Tempo increases. There's not a particular thing

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.500
 that I do. Um, this work is challenging, and even if you're not,

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.330
 even if you're not, uh, about to deploy your operation tip, it was high.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.150
 Anyway. It just stays high and will always be high, no matter what

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.980
 community know what matter what community you're in. So it's almost

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.800
 as if once it moves past the point, it's really ends up. You do.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.630
 It's all the same to you at my level. Is it? When I was a department

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.450
 head, I was responsible for all types of things. All the time. Required

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.280
 my attention on dear, just you. You just deal with it. You just

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.100
 do the job, get one thing done at a time. If you can handle it, and

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.930
 pretty soon you just move through it all. And that's really the best.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.750
 The best advice I can give about handling a high optempo situation
