00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.330
So Joo is that the bottom of the totem pole when it comes to the officer

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.810
 corps? Interestingly enough, without a strong junior officer corps,

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:17.280
 you will have a problem in any command you're in. But that doesn't

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.760
 mean the junior officers have the full perspective on why we're doing

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.240
 what we're doing headed any one particular time. A good example

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.720
 of this is the deployments of the aircraft carrier out in Japan. That's

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.200
 where I was. When you think about flying or deploying in general,

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.680
 do you think about doing things and you don't? And when you first

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.150
 get in the Navy as a junior officer, you're thinking probably along

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.630
 those same lines, very romanticized view of what you're going to be

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.110
 doing in the Navy. But then taking the Jap, the carrier that's based

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.590
 in Japan, as an example. When they deploy, they typically do the exact

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.070
 same things every year, specific locations and the point of them

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.550
 being there is just to be there, to dissuade any of any potential adversaries,

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.020
 from doing anything that leads to the folks on that carrier,

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.500
 doing things that air very run of the mill that could be very routine

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.980
 and in a very, very boring. The strategic importance of the carrier

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.460
 is perhaps not seen by the junior officer, just like it's probably

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.940
 not seen by the enlisted. Now it can be gleaned, and I think he'd

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.420
 be gleaned fairly easily by both of those cruise. But as a general

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.890
 rule, that junior officer doesn't have much more inside a STO. What's

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.370
 exactly happening, as has perhaps here listed on your listed court

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.850
 would either.
