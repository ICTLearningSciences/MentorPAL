00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.470
you prepare for significant operational events by being prepared early,

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.090
 and that could mean just operating the way you would want the inspectors

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.720
 to see on a daily basis. Now that's a hard thing to do, because

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.340
 usually when you're being inspected or you're getting ready for deployment,

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.960
 especially the training involved with getting ready for deployment,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.580
 the inspectors and trainers may be trying to nit pick the

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.200
 small things that they've got to find something wrong. Um, so that's

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.830
 kind of different, kind of kind of difficult. But, you know, if you

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.450
 if you set a standard that's based off of like how you want to deploy,

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.070
 how you want, how you want other people to see you, how you would

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.690
 want a trainer to see your inspector to see you. If that's just the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.310
 way you operate, that can go a long way and make getting prepared

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.940
 for these events much, much simpler. That's never going to be easy.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.560
 There's always gonna be something, but you know, that's 11 thing you

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.180
 could do
