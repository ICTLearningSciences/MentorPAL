00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.510
work schedule. Flexibility is on Lee, based on what your superior wants

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.180
 you to do. Um, even being a leader, even being the superior other

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.840
 people doesn't automatically mean you can flex your work schedule just

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.500
 because you want to. And in fact, there is an argument that that

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.170
 some people might make that your work schedule should be more stringent

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.830
 than those working below you. I was fortunate and that my superiors

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.490
 wanted me to get my work done and if I did not need to be there,

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.150
 and my our shop had gotten everything done than we were good to go.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.820
 But it does. Just because you're a leader doesn't automatically mean

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.480
 you have flexibility, your work hours.
