00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.110
Well, some things you have to remember about reaching your life goals

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.370
 is that timing is a huge aspect of it. Um, and I do know I also don't

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.630
 think, uh, a goal has to be a particular path because they're gonna

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.890
 be demands on your life that you can't control, especially being in

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.150
 the military. So, for instance, if you want to get a higher education,

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.410
 say beyond a master's degree and you're still in the military,

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.670
 you have military responsibilities that you have to fulfill, probably

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.930
 before you can attain that goal. Now, there are certain ways you might

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.190
 be able to to get closer to that goal in the military. But I think

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.450
 that largely revolves around attaching yourself to people that are

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.710
 associated with haggle, asking people questions, making yourself

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.970
 known, making you're making it known that you're interested in that

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.230
 type of thing. Um, that's probably the best advice I can really give

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.490
 you right now.
