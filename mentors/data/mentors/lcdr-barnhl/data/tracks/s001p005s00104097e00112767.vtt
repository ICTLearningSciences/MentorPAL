00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.040
sometimes, even though someone thinks what they have, what they're doing

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.230
 is harmless. It can have an impact, a negative impact. Um, as an

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.420
 officer, you have to set the standard. You have to let them know what

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.610
 is appropriate and that any deviation from that is what will not be

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.790
 tolerated. Uh, it sounds quite draconian, but that is the reality

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.980
 of this situation. You can talk to them in a reason way and let them

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.170
 know why you think the way you think. But they continue to deviate

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.360
 from that. Then you might have to take action and, uh, and be a bit

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.550
 more, um, disciplined in your response.
