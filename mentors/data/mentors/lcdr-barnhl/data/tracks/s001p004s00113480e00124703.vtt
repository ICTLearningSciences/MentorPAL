00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.010
so there are vast opportunities in the Navy. Um, that is that is effect.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:11.170
 Not all opportunities were considered equal. And not all opportunities

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.330
 are seen as, um, truly helping the Navy in the best way they can.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.490
 However, some of those opportunities air good personally for the

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.650
 for the one doing the job. If you you can certainly move into a different

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.810
 position, that might not be the best for your career, but might

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.970
 be the best for you. And usually that might come in the form of an

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.120
 application process or a recommendation from a commanding officer

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.280
 or something like that. But to boil it down. Really, if you want to

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.440
 move into a new role, a new position that you think might help you advance

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.600
 but is particularly competitive because it probably is, you're

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.760
 gonna need people backing you up. To move into that position, you're

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.920
 gonna need the full support of your superior officers in order to

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.080
 be able to be selected for that role
