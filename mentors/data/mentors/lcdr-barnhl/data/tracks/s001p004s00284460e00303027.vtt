00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.250
the choice to go to college is a total personal one. I am of the opinion

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.660
 on this is my own personal opinion that having some world experience

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.060
 benefits you in college. Um, and there's also one might also say

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.460
 that you seeing because you got to keep in mind you will be. If you

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.860
 don't go to college, you're gonna be in the enlisted ranks. One might

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.270
 say that seeing the enlisted side of things prior to becoming an

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.670
 officer is actually a very good experience on dhe valuable. And I think

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.070
 that's true, generally speaking. But, you know, it's that is still

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.480
 a very personal decision. Some people are right for college as soon

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.880
 as they get out of high school. Other times, you know, they need

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.280
 the world experience to gain some maturity, the maturity which is valuable

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.690
 in their practicalities of that. If you're not mature and you

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.090
 waste time in college, then you're gonna be we're gonna be wasting

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.490
 money. But you're also just wasting time and gaining Cem otherwise good

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.890
 experience that you might otherwise have gotten, so there's no really

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.300
 good answer that it depends on the person. But if you're ambivalent

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.700
 about going to college, then perhaps you you should, and you want

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.100
 to serve the military or serve in the military. Perhaps you should

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.510
 serve first, and then you can decide later to go to college and get

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.910
 a degree that way. And if you want to from there and there are there

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.310
 are programs to do this, you can go. The Navy can send you to college

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.710
 in order to become on officer on the backside. If not, you have

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.120
 the 9 11 g i bill, which can pay for your college after you after

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.520
 you've served.
