 designated a naval aviator, a supportive and keep in mind that just

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.970
 because you finished pilot training, it doesn't mean the learning

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.670
 stops. There are several different qualifications you then have to attain

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.080
 of continuing education for the 1st 10 years of your career.
