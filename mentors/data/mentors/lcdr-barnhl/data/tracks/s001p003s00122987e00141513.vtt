Generally speaking, the military is not terribly accepting of failure.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.230
 We'll keep people around me, is lying. I mean, as long as it's not

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.430
 a hey large start that over. Generally speaking, the military is I have

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.620
 experienced. It has not been that accepting of failure, despite

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:31.810
 me having been given a significant second chance after my helicopter

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:38.000
 crash. However, there are plenty of examples where you see that somebody

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.190
 has failed and they have been fired right away. Um, and part of

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.380
 it, I think, is because it is a seeming hope. High profile. You have

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:56.580
 high profile failures, often times, uh, that bleeds, too. Command

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.770
 relief and other things like that. Um, I do not think that is a good

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:08.960
 way to handle any organization because failure is inevitable, even

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.150
 high profile failures. It's necessary to think about how you're going

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.340
 to handle handle those and those people that are involved with those

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.530
 failures because you can't just get rid of people because they fail.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.730
 They still have value to add. In fact, one might say that, uh,

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.920
 that failing helps a person learn more. They might be in a better position.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.110
 Tau lead. After a failure like that
