00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.980
on any Navy base. There's always the fleeting family support center, and

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.120
 this is provides information of all kinds related to perhaps housing

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.250
 or schooling. I could not enumerates all types of information that's

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.380
 on the base, but the fleet, if I would, I would recommend going

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.520
 to the Flea and Family Support Center. If you have any real question

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.650
 on any any general topic for the area, you're gonna be in if you're

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.780
 not. If you're not finding what you need there than military, one

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.920
 source dot com also has a lot of information that I can point you in

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.050
 the right direction.
