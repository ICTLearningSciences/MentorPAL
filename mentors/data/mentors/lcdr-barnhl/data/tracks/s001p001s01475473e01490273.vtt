00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.080
the most difficult part of my training. I would say there was a specific

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.310
 thing that was difficult. I would say that my mindset, Um, I'm the

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:16.540
 type of person that wants to to do well, like automatically. And,

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.770
 you know, they're gonna be times and your training that you're not going

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.000
 to do. Well, you're gonna have bad days, and perhaps you might

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.230
 have a couple bad days in a row accepting that as a normal part of the

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.470
 way things work is important. Realizing that that's gonna happen

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.700
 is important. You're going to fail, and that's okay. Realizing it's

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.930
 okay. It's probably most difficult part for me. I did not have a ton

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.160
 of failures when I was going through my training, but there were some

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.390
 and it was very impactful. So that was one of the was one of things.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.620
 I had to learn that it's okay to fail, that you're going to fail,

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.850
 but you need to figure out how to move past it.
