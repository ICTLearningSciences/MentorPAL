most stress as a naval officer is wondering, what somebody is going to

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.220
 do is your subordinate. That's gonna have an impact on your life and

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.400
 how you're gonna answer for it to your boss. For better or worse,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.590
 the mistakes of your subordinates are projected on you, and they're

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.770

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.950
 because you have a lot of people working for you and they can come

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.140
