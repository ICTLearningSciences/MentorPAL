00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.790
people in the Navy have an opinion on how to do things. Um, and those

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.740
 opinions are cover a very wide spectrum as far as who you should talk

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.680
 to you about what you should do in the Navy. On the obvious choice

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.620
 would be those who have done it before you. So those folks being your

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.560
 superiors, your commanding officers and your executive officer now,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.510
 typically, in any command, your executive officer is gonna be the

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.450
 one that's gonna kind of facilitate you moving on to your next job.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.390
 And And he will make recommendations to the commanding officer to suggest

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.330
 for him to suggest, uh, where you should go. If you want a formal

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.280
 discussion on on things like this, you can talk with your detailer

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.220
 Who is whose Establishing Millington, Tennessee. If you go there

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.160
 a website, you'll no doubt find a good contact email for those folks.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.110
 But surely speaking, if you're trying to decide what to do with your

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.050
 career, you should get a wide range of opinions. You should talk

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.990
 to people that are both in and outside your community. You should talk

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.930
 to people that were inside your community but then decided to leave

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.880
 Deviate for the typical career path, and you can get an idea of

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.820
 how their experience vary from those who stayed on the career path.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.760
 Um, I've given plenty of advice to people on on eye on things like this.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.700
 And what I think is important to remember is that no career path

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.650
 is is the same. They're similar, but they were never the same. So

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.590
 what work for somebody won't necessarily work for you?
