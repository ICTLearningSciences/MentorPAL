00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.030
Throughout my career, I've always had to learn new skills. Whether it

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.200
 was attaining a new qualification or flying a new aircraft, it's pretty

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.380
 much consistent. And if you're not getting better something or if

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.560
 they're new new skills to attain, then you're stagnating and you're

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.730
 probably not gonna progress too far and what you're in, what in your

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.910
 chosen career path.
