00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.040
there are a number of resource is that I think I could list off. I'll

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.220
 name just a couple now. Wide for War is a book by Peter Singer. It kind

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.410
 of gives you an idea of the technology aspect of the military and

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.590
 where things are likely going to be going. Um, and that's especially

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.780
 important the aviation community, because we think of aviation's

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.970
 like the persons in a cockpit flying. But things were moving away from

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.150
 that, albeit slowly. Pretty soon, we're gonna have you're gonna have

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.340
 drones flying off carriers that will be responsible for refueling

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.520
 jet aircraft. And that's what we've already seen that with the MQ

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.710
 25 stingray I flew drones and drones fly off ships routinely. Now, though,

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.900
 you know it's still slowly developing. So the romanticized view

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.080
 of being an aviator is certainly changing. Another good book that

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.270
 I have really liked and then offered a lot of perspective that's not

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.450
 specific specific towards the military is called Thinking Fast and

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.640
 slow by Daniel Kahneman. It's kind of a dense read, but it is very

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.830
 good. It gives you an idea of how people think, uh, why they think the

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.010
 way they do and essentially just breaks down that we'll have intuition

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.200
 and most the time. It's wrong, which is somewhat disconcerting

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.390
 in some respects. But it allows you to question yourself. There's nothing

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.570
 wrong with, and it's nothing wrong with question yourself may

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.760
 allow. It kind of gives you an idea of Maybe I should think a little

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.940
 harder. Why, this is the way it is. I always thought of it is it helped

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.130
 me not come to rash judgments as we're all want to do. In my opinion,

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.320
 I also like various documentaries. One of my favorites is fairly

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.500
 recent Ken Burns. Vietnam War is a tremendous documentary, like

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.690
 any of his other work, but it gives you real perspective on things

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.870
 that were going on during that period and perhaps helps you realize

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.060
 that while there was a lot of animosity at that time, and, you know,

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.250
 we think we've learned from that time perhaps things you know. Some

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.430
 things are still still suspect, and we should be watching out for those

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.620
 things. So those were just three resource is that of a ton that

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.800
 I could think of regards of what I say read, read everything you get

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.990
 hands on, and that will go a long way to helping you
