00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.840
It's hard to say because you're you're part of the command, your priorities

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.840
 should align. What I could say is that there are times when the

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.830
 commands priorities did not align with the the tear of command above.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.830
 That's priority of us priorities. Um, so in a Nativity in aviation,

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.820
 you have several different squadrons, and their squadrons belong

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.810
 to the wing, and there's a wing commander and usually tasking comes

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.810
 through the wing and is given out in his dispersed amongst the squadron's,

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.800
 depending on Operation tempo and all that type of thing. Uh,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.800
 the wing typically does not care too much about what your person, what

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.790
 your personal command problems are. You can always voice them, but

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.790
 they often times say, That's nice to know. Now do what I had to do.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.780
 Do it, we're telling you to d'oh! So there are plenty of times where

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.770
 that has come into play. One of them, specifically was being prepared

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.770
 to help put out what wildfires in Southern California and a lot

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.760
 of the hoops we had to jump through to make that be a possibility

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.760
 was was truly frustrating. But nonetheless, we had to do it, how we

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.750
 didn't have a choice
