00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.490
I don't think there's exactly one question that I would ask one of my

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.140
 issues with the initial training I received in the Naval Academy in

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.780
 the indoctrination they provided was was that it was the way they presented

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.430
 being in the Navy to me after looking back, it's not exactly

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.070
 reality. You don't truly understand. It's like having Children. You

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.720
 don't really know what it's like until you actually do it. And then

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.360
 you realized both the joys and the difficulties that our associate

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.010
 with, but no one really tells you about. So there are so many questions

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.650
 you could ask to try and fill the void of. You don't know what you

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.300
 don't know, but you know, that would take too much time. And there's

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.940
 not really I can't There's not really any specific thing that I

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.590
 thought I was just missing out on. I think one. I think one of the things

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.230
 one of the things that I wish I could have been conveyed is that

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.880
 it's okay not to know everything. That's what the people working

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.520
 for you or for now, of course, that's required. That requires you to

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.170
 be able to listen and ask the appropriate questions. But you don't

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.810
 have to know everything. And in some respects I think that that isn't

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.460
 it's appropriate. It's appropriate important to show that you don't

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.100
 know everything, because that shows that you're willing to rely on

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.750
 other people to help you. And there's nothing wrong with that. That's

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.390
 to me. That's a strength. But that wasn't that wasn't something that

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.040
 was typically conveyed as a leader. When you're young 22 in my case,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.680
 you first become commissioned. You assume Oh my gosh, How am I

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.330
 going to I need to know everything. I can't show that I don't. But I

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.970
 can tell you that if you have somebody that's working for you who has

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.620
 had 10 years of experience, maybe even five, they will make it very

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.260
 clear to you that you don't know what you're talking about and that

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.910
 you need to listen to them. Uh, hopefully in a respectful way. But

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.550
 it will become very clear very quickly
