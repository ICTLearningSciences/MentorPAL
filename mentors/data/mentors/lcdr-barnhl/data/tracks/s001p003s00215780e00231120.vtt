00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.090
there's not particularly one most dangerous thing I've ever done. Flying

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.340
 helicopters. The nature of being a helicopter pilot is dangerous

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.580
 because helicopters don't want to fly. Um, but you can point to any

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.820
 night flying over the ocean when there's no moon or it's cloudy and

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.060
 raining where you can't see much and you're susceptible to, uh, various

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.310
 physiological effects that can. I mean, they could put you in the

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.550
 water very easily, uh, one of the most normal and yet harrowing experiences

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.790
 that any helicopter pilot has, and they had him all the time

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.040
 is doing night landings on the back of small ships. You're basically

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.280
 putting a helicopter down in a small space with a wall right in

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.520
 front of you. If you if you do it poorly, then your rotor blades, you're

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.760
 gonna hit the ship. Uh, that is that's pretty for as often as we

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.010
 do it, I still don't feel terribly comfortable doing. I have hundreds

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.250
 of landing on the back of ships at night,
