Well, what if you're married in the military, then you pretty much are

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.450
 in a permanent state of conflict because your spouse, whether they

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.750
 like it or not, are subject to what your career trajectory is. He or

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.050
 she does not have a choice in that. Now you can do the best you can

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.350
 to soften the blow, but the Navy very well might decide that you need

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.650
 to go somewhere. That does not provide a lot of opportunity for your

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.950
 spouse. That's the biggest conflict I see. And I don't think there's

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.250
 any good, necessarily good resolution to that, other than to say

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.550
 that it will be for a short period, relatively short period of time

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.850
 and time is always on your side when these things occur.
