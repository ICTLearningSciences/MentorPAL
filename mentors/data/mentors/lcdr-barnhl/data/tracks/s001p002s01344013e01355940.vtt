00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.130
there are a couple things you should not touch. If you're trying to handle

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.420
 things, uh, you know, especially in your command as a junior officer,

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.700
 you should really never be doing this. You should always. If

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.990
 something's going on, it should be elevated because it's not your responsibility

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.270
 to deal with discipline when it comes to things like non

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.560
 judicial punishment and stuff like that. If you are dealing with anything,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.840
 involves, uh, alcohol for one any toward any type of sexual

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.130
 abuse assault, hazing, initiations that might be construed as hazing.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.410
 Hi. Anything like that? Uh, breaking safety protocols. Those things

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.700
 shouldn't I mean, should never be handled in house because that can

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.980
 be a It could be a severe detriment to a command. I've seen that

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.270
 happen where things have been swept under the rug or just kept within,

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:09.550
 say, a particular shop in a command when really they should have

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.840
 been elevated to the commanding officer in, he should have been dealing

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.120
 with them
