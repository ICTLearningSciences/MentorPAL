00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.060
I've been stationed in San Diego, Japan, Fallon, Nevada and now I'm in

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.270
 Monterey. I was also in Pensacola for training for a time. Uh, I love

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:16.480
 being overseas. It was a great experience. Um, a lot of very, especially

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.690
 in Japan. I would recommend that anybody very unique culture,

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.900
 very unique experience. It is difficult for spouses there to find

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.120
 work if they said, if they desire to do so. San Diego's a fantastic

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.330
 location stateside. We how is very expensive. But it's sunny all the

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.540
 time, and the weather's great lots to do for both the member in the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.750
 family if they so desire. Because the size of the Navy contingent in

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.960
 San Diego there's a lot of is a large support network there. Fallon

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.170
 Nevada was in the middle of nowhere in the high desert. Um, my, my

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.380
 wife would say that was her least favorite. I would say so to my job

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.590
 was very interesting and a lot of very interesting flying, but it

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.800
 is in the middle of nowhere, and it takes a special person Thio appreciate

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.010
 that type of thing. Nonetheless, it was a good tour, and I enjoyed

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.220
 it on again, a formative experience experience of my life. Monterey

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.440
 is Ah is itself also unique experience. That's a very upscale

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.650
 area that has a high cost of living. So as a za joo, you and with a

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.860
 family, you might have to choose to live in base housing, which, incidentally,

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.070
 is pretty good. But you don't won't necessarily get the chance

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.280
 to live off base, depending on how much money you're willing to

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.490
 pay.
