00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.890
So if people are meeting standards, I think they're a couple of ways more

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.930
 than a couple of ways to deal with it first, you can try motivate

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.970
 him. This can work. And I think a lot of times it does work. Um, but

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.010
 not always. You have to. And in order to help someone that is not

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.060
 maintaining standards, you have to understand why they're not maintaining

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.100
 standards. Uh, that can. That may help you come up with a good

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.140
 strategy toe, help them get back up to where they should be. Now,

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.180
 if if someone is consistently failing to meet standards, there comes

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.220
 a point that they may not be cut out for what they're doing, and that's

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.260
 OK. It doesn't necessarily feel okay. It feels like you. Sometimes

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.300
 I feel like you might be giving up on someone. But in the long run,

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.340
 that person is responsible for how they handle themselves. You can't

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.390
 force them to do it. You can facilitate an environment that helps

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.430
 them do it, and you really should do all you can to help them. That's

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.470
 the expectation in the military, but in the in the long run, it's

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.510
 their responsibility to maintain the stage that they won't do it.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.550
 Then they're gonna need to find another line of work
