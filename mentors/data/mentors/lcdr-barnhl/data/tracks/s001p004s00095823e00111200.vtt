00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.120
the most important things that air on your proverbial military resume.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.390
 Often Ah, the jobs you've done, how well you've done in them. When

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.660
 I say speak of jobs, I don't mean just any random job. I really mean

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.930
 the jobs that your particular community considers valuable. For instance,

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.200
 the aviation community considers doing a production tour after

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.470
 your first see two are as valuable and production tour is defined

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.730
 as maybe, training pilots. Teoh go to the fleet in your particular aircraft.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.000
 That would be like a fruit fleet replacement squadron. Let's

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.270
 look at that up another time. Um, but that would be a good idea, a

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.540
 good, good, ah example of a of a production tour and a job that the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.810
 aviation community considers valuable. There are other jobs, too. That

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:04.080
 would do. They would do something similar. But if you if you choose

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.350
 to move off the well trod path Theun, there's less likelihood for

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.620
 you for your resume to be considered for consistent promotion.
