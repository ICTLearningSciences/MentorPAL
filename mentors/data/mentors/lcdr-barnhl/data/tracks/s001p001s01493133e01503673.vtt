00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.880
conflicts is normal in a new unit. If you're new to that, you know, I

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.910
 should say there's an adage you need to shut up for the 1st 6 months.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.940
 Shut up and listen. If you're causing conflict has directly related

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.970
 to you, then you need to take a better look at yourself because you

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.000
 don't you really don't know what's going on until you've observed

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.030
 what's happening in that unit for a period of time. They say six months.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:36.070
 But it could just as well be three months if you come in there.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.100
 If you come into a new unit and start trying to change things automatically

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.130
 specifically as a junior officer, that can grow people the

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.160
 wrong way. So really, I would say in a roundabout way, is that if you

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.190
 go to a new unit to avoid the conflict, start from the positions,

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.220
 you know, I'm gonna listen first, and once I get an idea of how things

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.250
 work, then I'm going to try and serve myself
