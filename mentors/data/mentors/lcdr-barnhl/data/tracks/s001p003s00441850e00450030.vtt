00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.030
when I was a junior officer, I never really thought about choosing housing,

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.210
 really It all. There's not a good answer for that. I think it's

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.390
 really what makes you happy when it comes to comes to choosing that

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.570
 type of thing. Um, I know that if you go to flight school in in Pensacola

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.750
 and then your subsequently in Milton flying in Milton, you know

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.930
 that particular that basis, kind of out of the way. So you're gonna

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.110
 have to you have to count for a drive time in traffic time and things

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.290
 like that. But really, it's like the nuts. There's those types

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.470
 of things you have to decide whether they're important to you or not.
