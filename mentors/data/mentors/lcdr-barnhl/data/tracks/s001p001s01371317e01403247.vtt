00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.240
I don't particularly think there any riel skills that I needed. Um, entering

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.620
 the navy. It was nice to have the Naval Academy is a kind of

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.010
 indoctrination, too. The navy. He's kind of see where you're as a as

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.400
 a midshipman. It's kind of a weird dichotomy in that you're coddled,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.780
 but then you're not, You know, your butt that you're yelled at you.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:33.170
 They wanna treat you with kid gloves and then you But then at the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.560
 same time, they're gonna kind of throw you into the fire. Says there's

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.940
 that wasn't self on. Okay, thing to have happen. Um, but a lot of

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.330
 what you learn about being in the Navy occurs while you're doing it.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.710
 I mean, if there was an example of on the job training being in the

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.100
 military, is it? You could say that I wish I had learned to fly before

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.490
 I was in the Navy. But anybody can see this year volume of people

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:10.870
 that go through the aviation training pipeline shows that that is

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.260
 not necessary. You don't have to major anything specific in order to

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.650
 be an aviator. Same thing goes for being a surface warfare officer.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.030
 Now, if submarines might be somewhat different. But you know, there's

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.420
 nothing specific that you have to do that will automatically determine

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.810
 you have a better time in the Navy than another. Um, one thing

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.190
 I will say. It's not specifically a skill. Uh, is that it really helps

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.580
 if you are a reader, um, and a writer, for that matter. Uh, if

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.970
 you're willing to sit down and read and that that that and you start

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.350
 that early, then that automatically gives you different perspectives

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.740
 again. You don't agree with the perspective, but it still gives you

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.130
 a different perspective. And I think the more you see people read,

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.510
 uh, the more effective they can be in how the on how they lead people,

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.900
 because it also shows a willingness to learn. Now, as far as writing

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.290
 is concerned, I learned to write at the Naval Academy pretty effectively,

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.670
 and I wouldn't say that that I would be the type of writer

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.060
 that would write any particular anything professionally at this particular

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.440
 moment, still need work on it, but conveying of ideas, you're

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.830
 always gonna have to answer to somebody, and a lot of times the way

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.220
 you're gonna have to answer questions is via written communication,

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.600
 being able to effectively, efficiently, cogently, concisely right

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.990
 and those ideas is essential. So when he can't write just sounds sounds

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.380
 like they have not been educated. Uh, appropriately, um, there's

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.760
 a level of professionalism that comes with that that people don't

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.150
 give enough weight to.
