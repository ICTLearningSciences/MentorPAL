00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.850
like any profession, it's difficult to really determine what piers or

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.840
 superiors or subordinates you can you can rely on. But as you get more

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.840
 exposure to him to those folks, you'll learn what they're like and

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.840
 what they consider important and how and whether they'll help you

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.840
 get out. It may be a difficult situation. Um, I would say there's any

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.830
 particular thing that you would would see automatically, but more

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.830
 sustained performance type idea, as in, if you if you see someone just

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.830
 arrived to the squadron and you know they end up being very good

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.820
 anticipating problems, they're very good at looking ahead and ensuring

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.820
 that they're not just thinking about the problem immediately in front

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.820
 of them, but kind of looking out and predicting how that how our

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.820
 reaction to that problem will affect us in the long run. If that type

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.810
 of that type of personality entered your enters your world, then

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.810
 I think you can say those folks can help you out. The long run a SZ

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.810
 for superiors are concerned superiors that are consistently asking

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.800
 you how you're doing and what you're interested in, and you aren't just

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.800
 strictly on a professed staying on a professional level, but you

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.800
 kind of move into the personal level. To some extent, Um, in my experience,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.800
 that has been an indicator of whether I can trust them and

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.790
 rely on them. Help me out in my best interest, and I think that has

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.790
 served me well.
