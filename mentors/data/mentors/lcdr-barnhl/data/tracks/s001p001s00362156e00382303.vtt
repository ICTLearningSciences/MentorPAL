00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.130
on a typical short tour. It depends on the number of hours you work. Depends

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.410
 on what you're doing. I I worked probably 50 hours a week on

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.690
 average, but I'm specifically inserting the term average there because

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.970
 some weeks I was low if no one was in town training, but folks were

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.250
 in town training required a lot of a lot of effort. 12 14 hour days

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.540
 sometimes. Um, and a deployable squadron, if you are not deployed

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.820
 again, depends on what you're doing. Uh, 10 hour days, pretty normal.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.100
 Uh, if you're flying and you have a lot of qualifications and therefore

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.380
 a lot of demands on your life, then professional is what I mean.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.660
 Then you could work 12 hour days Easy. If you are a Tse and I say

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.940
 this without any tongue and cheek, you're on duty 24 hours a day.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.220
 As a junior officer, you you are not the demands when you're not terribly

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.500
 high. Um, specifically at at sea eso it Doesn't Ellen say unnecessary?

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.780
 Feels like you're on duty 24 hours a day. But again, as you

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.060
 move up in the ranks when everybody seems to need your attention, you

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.340
 know you'll get woken up at all hours the night for them, too, because

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.620
 someone needs you to do something or make a decision about something.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.910
 So it's That's why I will make a blanket statement that you're

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.190
 on duty 24 hours a day while under while under way in the aviation

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.470
 community. The saving grace is that you are if you're gonna be flying,

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.750
 you are required to have at least eight hours available of uninterrupted

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.030
 sleep, which is not the same in other communities. So that

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.310
 did help point of it.
