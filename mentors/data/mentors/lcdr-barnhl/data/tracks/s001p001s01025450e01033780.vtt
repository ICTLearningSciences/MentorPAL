WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.660
work. They changed over the course of my career in that I ended up taking

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.470
 a lot of my work home with me. Um, that wasn't always the case.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.280
 Uh, as a department head, you're constantly on call, even at home, because

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.090
 if someone gets in trouble, they call that you will. You will

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.910
 inevitably get a call, uh, from someone in the chain of command and

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.720
 let you know what has happened so that you can tell the commanding

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.530
 officer. So there's always a chance that this could happen. Um, that's

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.340
 that's probably the main difference and how things transitioned over

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.150
 as you stay in the Navy longer.
