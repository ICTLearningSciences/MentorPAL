00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.150
There are plenty of that indicators that that suggest a team or group

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.450
 is gonna are gonna have issues. One of the main ones is ah, is I think

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.760
 the, um loosening of standards normalizing that that type of behavior.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.060
 Um, one thing that one way to keep that in check is by the leader

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.360
 maintaining the standards. And that's both the overall leader. Um,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.660
 but also the noncommissioned officers, which the in generally speaking

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.960
 of military noncommissioned officers do very well, and they're

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.270
 not afraid to tighten up their supporters. But they're also not afraid

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.570
 it tighten up their junior officers superiors, as is appropriate.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.870
 Um, generally speaking of maintaining of standards is essential now.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.170
 Not all every standard is created equal. That's not talking. If if

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.470
 your hair cuts are not that great, that's not the same thing. Is not

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.780
 adhering to safety regulations? Um, the regulation pieces more of

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.080
 what I would I would I would be concerned with, uh, less the the personal

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.380
 appearance, though that is important too.
