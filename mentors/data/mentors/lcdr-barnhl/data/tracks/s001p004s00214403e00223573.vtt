00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.550
The advice that I have received from from peers, superiors and subordinates

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.250
 that has really helped me move forward is first and foremost.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.950
 Take care of your people if you show an interest in your people than

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.650
 that resonates in different parts of the job, and people see that and

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.350
 you'll get a big you get a boost because because people talk about

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.050
 you being a pretty good officer, it doesn't matter if you're demanding.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.750
 It doesn't matter if you're hard nosed and persistent. If you're

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.450
 helping people, they end up respecting you because maybe even because

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.150
 of those things, maybe we respect him or because of those things.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.850
 They know what to expect from you, and they can consider you a reliable

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.550
 person, a reliable officer.
