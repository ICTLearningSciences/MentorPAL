00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.700
so enjoying the enjoying The navy? Um, you don't know what you don't know.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.550
 Um, which is understandable. But if you boil it down to a priority

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.400
 that you would like to see in a command and I translate command

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.250
 into any entity that you're gonna work in while you're in the Navy and

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.100
 you could take that it's d down to the very aircraft you're going

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.940
 to command because there is a commander of an era of each aircraft,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.790
 huh? Is number one for first and foremost respect going both ways.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.640
 Now, some of you might end up being in a single seat aircraft. So you

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.490
 know the maid. Perhaps that's not the best example. But I flew an

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.340
 aircraft that had up thio, typically five people that I was responsible

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.190
 for. There have. You have to show respect for the people that are

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.040
 below you, and they and you have to demand the respect coming back

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.890
 the other way. That is absolutely essential to ineffective, uh, working

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.740
 environment, whether you're talking about being on the ground or

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.590
 in the air, and I think that's something you could just generally

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.440
 take with you in any facet of life if You know, if people are being

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.290
 respectful, one other one another than there's gonna be friction and

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.130
 difficulty and you could circumvent that very easily by just establishing

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.980
 that from the get go. The way you're gonna operate is gonna be

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.830
 based on respect. You can have differences, but as long as you can

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.680
 respect each other in your differences, that's that goes a long way.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.530
 Might sound a little bit naive, but if you establish that early, that

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.380
 will take you for
