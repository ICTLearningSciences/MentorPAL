I do not recommend dating while you're on a ship. It is generally frowned

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.440
 upon because superiors air typically worried about what you call

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.230
 good order and discipline. You definitely can't share a room. Oh, or

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.020
 anything like that. However, you know, relationships develop if you're

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.820
 going. If that's going to happen, then you need to save it for

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.610
 a poor call.
