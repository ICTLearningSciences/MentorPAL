00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.980
good strategy to advance in the military is difficult to nail down. There's

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.110
 not any one specific strategy, but what I would say is give yourself

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.240
 options. That's that's what I did. So I spent a lot of time wondering

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.360
 whether I want to stay in or get out. And, um, but because

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.490
 I wasn't sure I went ahead and did a few jobs that I knew the community

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.620
 was going to see is valuable. And so I kept. I kept moving up in

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.750
 the ranks and gaining positional authority, uh, and that I think, served

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.880
 me well. If you don't do those jobs, then it's very easy for the

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.010
 community to tell you, too, that you will not be selected for for

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.140
 different types of promotion. But if you do, if you end up doing those

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.260
 jobs, it makes it difficult for them to say no, because you have

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.390
 the experience that they want and you have done the things that they

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.520
 have asked. So it makes the decision perhaps somewhat harder. That's

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.650
 best. The advice I would give a CE for strategy is concerned
