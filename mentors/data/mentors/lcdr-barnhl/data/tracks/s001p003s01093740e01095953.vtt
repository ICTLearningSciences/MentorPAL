regardless of if you're living on or off base, they're all. There's always

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.230
 an element of finding the housing where there's paperwork to fill

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.920
 out with the military housing folks or just finding a house to rent

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.600
 this not related to the military, you always have to put some effort,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.290
 and no one's gonna give you a house without you doing something

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.980
 about it.
