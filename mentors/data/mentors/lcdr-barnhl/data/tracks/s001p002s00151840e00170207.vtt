00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.310
Not every leadership strategy is appropriate for every subordinate. Some

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.760
 subordinates Onley react to draconian measures. Other subordinates

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.220
 react to the very fact that they could get in trouble. They don't

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.680
 need the motivation Thio to do the right thing. Um, I had a sailor that

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.130
 was working for me. Haven't be a warm a young woman. And she was

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.590
 She had a domestic violence and I don't think they turned it like that.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.040
 As in she I had a physical altercation with her significant other

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.500
 in which she beat him up. Um, this was a second. This was the second

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.960
 of a couple events, and she was told that if anything else happened,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.410
 her command would not stick up for her and would not. I intend

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.870
 to keep her in the military. She would be separated. Well, she turned

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.330
 it around. She ended up becoming one of the best sailors that I worked

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.780
 with. Uh, I think one of the important things about discipline

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.240
 and establishing standards and using your very using your leadership

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.690
 is a mechanism for for how to do things is that we're all subject to

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.150
 failure. We all have problems. If you haven't had a problem yet. Well,

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.610
 you just need to wait, because you will. And you're going to need

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.060
 the mercy of your leader. Help you keep going. And that, I think,

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.520
 is true across the board.
