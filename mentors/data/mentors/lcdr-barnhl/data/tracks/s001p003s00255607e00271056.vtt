00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.170
self doubt is his pervasive. You always question whether you're doing

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.490
 the right thing. A SZ faras from a skill standpoint where, like flying,

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.810
 teaching, um, or even performing. If you're being evaluated, you

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.140
 just got it. It's remarkable. Once you actually get in the situation,

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.460
 I found that the doubt oftentimes evaporates because you proved yourself

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.780
 that you know what you're talking about and you know what you're

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.100
 doing. Self doubt is really more poisonous in and the time before

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.420
 you have to execute something or do something that is of consequence

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.740
 on the ways to handle that or just are myriad. You can think of

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:54.060
 all kinds of ways to do it. I often times would just go for a run or

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.390
 physical activity in general, try to take my mind off it. But in the

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.710
 moment, generally, you find that the choices you made the decisions

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.030
 you make, even if where they weren't the best decisions, they were

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.350
 still okay because you appropriately evaluated things
