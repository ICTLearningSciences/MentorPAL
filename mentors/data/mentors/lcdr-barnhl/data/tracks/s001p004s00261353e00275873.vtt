00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.390
you've asked plenty of good questions. I think one thing you could consider

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.920
 asking whether to me or to another to another superior, perhaps,

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.460
 is. You know what? Ah, how do I stay organized and keep keep? Ah,

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.000
 solid record on my officer accomplishments throughout my career. So

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.530
 one big interaction you will have is with the Navy Personnel Command.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:34.070
 And there's a nine idea out there that they have all the information

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.610
 about you in some vault Weatherby a digital or otherwise. But they

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.140
 screw up. They miss. Thinks they do not get fit reps. They do not

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.680
 have awards. It's very important for you to keep track of your accomplishments

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.220
 so that if they somehow get lost, you can quickly produce

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.760
 them in order to fill out your record. Because keep in mind when you're

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.290
 moving through your career and these different screen boards air,

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.830
 deciding if you're gonna move up would be it positionally or through

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.370
 just simple rank promotion. If they see a discrepancy in your record,

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.900
 that's all they have to go on. They don't have any real personal

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.440
 input from you about what you did, and those decisions will be made

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.980
 very quickly as in a matter of seconds, oftentimes. So be responsible

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.510
 for your record. Keep a good handle on it in the case that something

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.050
 comes up later.
