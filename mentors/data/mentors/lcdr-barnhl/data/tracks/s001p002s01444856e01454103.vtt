00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.220
if you find yourself in difficult situation, that wasn't your fault of

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.590
 the year there. There's not much you can do but just kind of roll with

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.970
 a roll with it, Um, that that's not an abnormal situation, not necessarily

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.340
 of failures. But, uh, things are more difficult than maybe

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.710
 they should be. But the reality of situation is, if there's nothing

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.080
 you could d'oh, there's nothing. There's nothing at that particular

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.450
 time. Then you just have to deal with this situation, and perhaps

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.820
 you can make it better as you deal with it. Maybe you can institute

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.200
 things that would prevent you from prevent people from getting to that

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.570
 situation further down the line. It might not be something specific

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.940
 you can do to fix it right then, but maybe you should focus on what

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.310
 you can do to prevent that from happening again.
