00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.890
If you're already established in a particular community, the way toe move

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.930
 across to a different community or transition its first. You got

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.960
 to talk to your commanding officer, and then there will likely be an

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.000
 application process of some sort. You need the commanding officers

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.040
 approval to be able to move across field. If that he does not support

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.080
 you, then you will not. So it's very important for you to establish

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.110
 that first. The second is generally a paperwork drill, but the application

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.150
 and perhaps other recommendations are good to have if you

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.190
 want to do that.
