00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.600
it's a suicide occurs in your unit. You should be respectful of the person

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.340
 and family involved. You shouldn't assume anything about the person

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.090
 in the long term. I think that a command should, uh, do its own

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.830
 introspection to determine how they could have helped the person anymore

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.580
 than they already had.
