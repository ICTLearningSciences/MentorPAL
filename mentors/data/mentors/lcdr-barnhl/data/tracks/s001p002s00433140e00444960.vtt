00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.370
the Navy is different from the other branches. I guess you could kind

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.880
 of think of it. Maybe is more of a strategic service. You know, we operate

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.400
 with, with the exception of special warfare, um, and things and

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.920
 communities like explosive ordnance disposal. Usually you're talking

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:33.430
 about warships floating around with compliments of large weapons,

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.950
 as opposed to, say, the Army, which the the entity that's operating

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:46.470
 might be a, uh, squad company platoon battalion of people, Um that

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.980
 can be used at different variations on maybe a tactical level. While

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.500
 while the Navy still does operates on the tactical level with the

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:06.020
 nature of patrolling the world's oceans, it becomes very strategic very

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.530
 quickly. That overall purpose of patrolling the sea lanes lends

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:19.050
 itself to be more be more strategic in general.
