My favorite book of all time is called A Short History of Nearly Everything

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.060
 by Bill Bryson. It is a very concise book about the about scientific

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.670
 development through the centuries is a very tractable and readable

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.270
 for ah, lay person. That's not that doesn't come from a science

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.880
 background.
