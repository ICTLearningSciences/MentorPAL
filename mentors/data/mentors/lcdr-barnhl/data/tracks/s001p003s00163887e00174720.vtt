00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.540
people can recover from professional miscues, but it just might not be

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.240
 in the way you think it is. Um, there's sometimes at the recovery is

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.930
 not a continued progression down that career path, but finding some

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.630
 other metric of success that that is meaningful to you on. You have

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.320
 to accept that. Sometimes there isn't just not gonna be an avenue

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.020
 for you to proceed after a proverbial bump in the road. So if you want

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.710
 to stay in, you might have to define your own metric of success and

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.400
 what that looks like. It might not look like a metric metric of success

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.100
 that is typical and the military sense, such as moving on to

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.790
 commanding officer or anything like that. But as long as you are finding

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.490
 that what you're doing as a as a measure of success, not really

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:09.180
 think that's all that matters
