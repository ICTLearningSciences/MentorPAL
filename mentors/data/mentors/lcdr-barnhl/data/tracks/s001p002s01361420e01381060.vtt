00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.390
So when I was the operations officer, uh, my last squadron, my commanding

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.940
 officer just taken over and our particular squadron would had a

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.480
 LOL of deployment. So we often got tasks with Tasked with a lot of non

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.020
 glamorous, unglamorous types of things. And specifically, we were

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.560
 tasked with doing some cargo off load between one ship and putting

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.110
 it on land. What my commanding officer wanted I want to do because it's

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.650
 kind of a tradition is to give give the sailors a long weekend,

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.190
 but because we're gonna have to be part of this, uh, the cargo off load,

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.740
 We couldn't do that. So my my particular position was, Well, we

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:56.280
 got to be part of it anyway, So let's throw all in, uh, make the most

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.820
 of it. And my dad idea is making the most of it was to support with

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.360
 Max effort as best we could. My commanding officer decided that that

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.910
 he was I think he wanted to make a point that we were not gonna

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.450
 be responsible for everything. Um, and he he wanted other people to

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.990
 be a be a part of it, and I kind of disagree. I kind of disagreed with

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.540
 that. Not not because other people shouldn't be part of it, but because

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.080
 I felt like his response was a bit petulant. Um, a lot of good

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.620
 could come of us doing that, and he could have given a long weekend

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.160
 at another time. Um, I lost that argument a CZ as subordinates or

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.710
 want to do this type situation, But that was one situation where there

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.250
 was disagreement in our team and I was a subordinate.
