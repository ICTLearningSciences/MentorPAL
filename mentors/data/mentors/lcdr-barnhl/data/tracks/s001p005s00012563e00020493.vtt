00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.760
So when I was a department head, there was some, uh, at least whispers

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.680
 of, perhaps sexual harassment going on in one of the shops. My commanding

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.590
 officer and executive officer took swift action on that on insured

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.500
 that that those who were responsible were dealt with appropriately.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.410
 And that's the way it should have been. Hiding anything like that

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.330
 is a bad idea. It's bad for the people involved, and certainly bad

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.240
 for the command, and if it is perceived it is being hidden, things

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.150
 will only get worse.
