00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.510
because there are all kinds of emergencies that could occur while you're

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.160
 away. Um, you can't come up with an all encompassing list, but really,

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.820
 what you need to do is just think generally about what things

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.470
 can occur. Talk it over with your spouse and come up with the general

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.130
 plan of how you would handle it. Uh, usually your family is not gonna

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.780
 be alone and unafraid they'll have. They'll have access to other

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.440
 families that have deployed members. They might have extended family

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.090
 available to see how you can incorporate those groups of people into

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.750
 your planning process, too.
