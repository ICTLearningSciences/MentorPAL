00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.350
the major negatives or detriments to this type of work. Some of them are

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.850
 fairly obvious. Time away from your family. If your operational tempo

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.350
 is high, you're gonna spend a lot of time away. Depending on what

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.850
 type of squadron you're in, you're gonna have to do a lot of training

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.350
 even if you're not deployed and that training and take you away.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.850
 Uh, that that's that can be trying that can be trying. Um, the other

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.350
 side of it is is kind of more of on intellectual idea. The military

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.850
 is you, as you can tell us, expects conformity. A lot of ways. Thinking

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.350
 outside the box is not has not always sought, sought after their

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.850
 situations where that is. But usually conformity is what is what

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.350
 they want. And if you have a curiosity and questioning nature than

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.850
 it can be very frustrating. And you also that doesn't get you as far

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.350
 as you might like on a career path, I'd say eso so while it is good

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.850
 to question, while it's good to be curious and asked, why are we doing

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.350
 this? Cause that's the typical question. Uh, constantly doing that

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.850
 can kind of give you a sour reputation, so you just need to be careful

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.350
 in how you do it
