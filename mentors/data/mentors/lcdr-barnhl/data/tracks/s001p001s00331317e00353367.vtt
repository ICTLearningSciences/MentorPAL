00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.380
so I'm a typical environment was different from day to day. If I wasn't

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.910
 flying, then I was typically in a hangar of some sort or the office

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.450
 is adjacent to a hangar. Nothing terribly abnormal are about that.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.980
 If I was flying, then the cockpit was where I was working or in the

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.510
 hangar proper, where maintenance was being done and not specifically

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.040
 overseeing the maintenance. But, you know, observing, uh and this

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.580
 also dependent on what I was doing at the time. So on the shore to where

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.110
 I was in an office or in the aircraft, if I was in a deployed squadron

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.640
 or deployable squatter, I was I could be in an office if we

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.170
 weren't deployed At that time, I could have been in the cockpit or I

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.700
 was on a ship. Uh, and there was on several different types of ships,

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.240
 aircraft carriers and destroyers, mostly hand trying to describe

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.770
 what those types of environments were like. This is kind of difficult.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.300
 It's one of those things. He you don't really appreciate it until

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.830
 you do it. But as far as an aircraft carriers concern, you know, it's

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.370
 it's an island unto itself. It's a very large island with a lot of

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.900
 people on it, but there's not a lot of different places to go had

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.430
 its own offices, but this one is a place like it's very industrial feeling.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.960
 So a lot of metal exposed, you know, not a lot of creature comforts

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.500
 in in the way of in the way of like making things look nice.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.030
 It was a warship, and that's what they what. The folks who built it

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.560
 expected it to look like, and that's the way it felt. One of the funny

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.090
 things that I always thought about was when I'd come home. And this

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.620
 is you don't know this until you hear someone tell you when we come

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.160
 home after a six month deployment or really any deployment. If you

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.690
 have a wife, she automatically makes you put your clothes in the

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.220
 washing machine because you smell terrible, largely because of just

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.750
 the way the ships of health. Uh, but you don't really know it at the

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.290
 time. But with all the metal around and the jet fuel and all the other

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.820
 things that are going on and perhaps 5000 closest friends, it's

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.350
 not terribly surprising that that that's the case
