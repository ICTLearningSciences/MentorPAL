00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.600
well in five years. That's kind of curious, because in five years I will

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.350
 I will have the opportunity to get out of the Navy. Um, and I don't

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.100
 know right now, if I'm going to stay in or not, there it depends

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.850
 what kind of opportunities they have. They have available. Um, if I

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.600
 decided to stay in, then hopefully I will continue my education. Um,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.350
 I would love to. I would love to get a PhD and teach at the Naval Academy,

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.100
 if at all possible. But if that doesn't happen, hopefully I

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.860
 will be able to get into some work involving what I'm learning right

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.610
 now, which is a lot of data science and data analysis. I don't particularly

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.360
 think I'll be flying anymore. Um, I think that part of my career

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.110
 is over. Uh, but, you know, that's just kind of natural life lifecycle

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.860
 of naval careers. At some point, you have to realize that you're

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.610
 not going to be doing what you've been doing for a while in 10

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.360
 years. I'm I'm pretty sure I'll be out of the Navy and I will have

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.110
 moved on to a to a second career
