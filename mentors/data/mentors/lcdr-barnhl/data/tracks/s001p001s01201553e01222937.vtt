00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.670
there are innumerable problems that you'll encounter. I think the way

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:12.490
 to root out problems is to establish a positive culture. Uh, if people

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.310
 feel like they belong in a positive way, it goes a long way to ensuring

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.130
 that those problems still enterprise. If you expect. If you show

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.950
 your subordinates that honesty is important, just for example, then

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.760
 they will emulate you. You'll have. You'll, of course, have some

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.580
 folks in your command that won't take to that type of leadership. But

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.400
 if you show qualities that air considered morally good, um, people

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.220
 will take that on board. They will know what the expectation is and

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:59.040
 that in itself can root out any problems that might exist if things

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.860
 were so bad that when you take a new leadership position that their

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.680
 specific things you need to eradicate and perhaps some draconian measures

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.500
 might be needed again, respect is essential. A lot of times

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.320
 you hear stories about in the various shops say in an aviation squadron,

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.140
 but it could apply to any type of unit. Uh, things were going behind

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.960
 going on behind closed doors that aren't necessarily on the up

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.780
 and up. Um, you need to figure that out and ensure that if a thing

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.590
 that is improper is going on and I mean inter personal relationships

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.410
 to professional relationships, to just doing things the right way in

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:57.230
 in the policy handed down, if things aren't happening in that in that

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:03.050
 respect, if people are cutting corners that you need to make sure

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.870
 people know that that will not be tolerated, and that can require

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:14.690
 some draconian measures sometimes.
