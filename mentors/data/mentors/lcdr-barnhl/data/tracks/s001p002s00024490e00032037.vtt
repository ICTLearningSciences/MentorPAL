00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.280
junior officers come into the military regards of service, basically knowing

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.720
 nothing the way they earn respect is by willing to learn from

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.150
 those that are below them because they often have more experience and

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.580
 more skill than that particular junior officer. An aviation. The

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.020
 junior officer comes into an operational squadron knowing how to fly

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.450
 an aircraft basic barely. But that's all they know how to do. The learning

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.890
 really starts starts there, and it usually starts with the people

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.320
 that are working immediately with them.
