00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.880
I've had to move seven times in my career. I've never been in the same

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.910
 place consecutively, so I first my first move was from the academy

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.930
 down to Pensacola, Florida, for flight training. I could have moved

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.960
 from there but had decided to stay, Um, in order to continue My advanced

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.990
 training are. And then after I finished flight training down there,

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.020
 I moved to San Diego, did about a year there and then from there

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.040
 I moved to Japan, spent three years in Japan, then moved to Fallon.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.070
 Nevada spent 3.5 years there and then back to Japan for another two

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.100
 years, then down to San Diego after that and now I'm in Monterey.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.130
 One of the things that you'll notice as you go through your career is

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.150
 that some people are able to stay in the same place. I never particularly

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.180
 wanted to do that on. I would say my wife didn't want to do

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.210
 that either much. Once we get used to going different places, we kind

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.240
 of wanted to keep doing it because it's exciting, it's it's it's fun

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.260
 to see new things. Now if you ask her about living in near Fallon,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.290
 Nevada. She would tell you she'd hate it. She hated it, and she never

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.320
 wanted to go back. But I would say that despite it being a very,

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.350
 you know, in the middle of the desert and largely unpopulated, uh,

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.370
 it gives you gives you perspective on different parts of our country

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.400
 that you might not ever consider living in. There's a world outside,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.430
 uh, the urban centers. And that was really, really a valuable experience.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.460
 I don't think I would love to go back there either, but I can

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.480
 appreciate it for what it is. And the most important thing I could

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.510
 say about moving and is that we got the opportunity to go overseas.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.540
 That was a significant formative experience in my life. Not everybody

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.570
 needs to move overseas to get that kind of perspective. Um, but it

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.590
 was a great experience for me, and I would recommend to any junior

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.620
 officer they take a tour overseas at least once in their career. It's

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.650
 easier to do it early on to do a late, and that's just a fact
