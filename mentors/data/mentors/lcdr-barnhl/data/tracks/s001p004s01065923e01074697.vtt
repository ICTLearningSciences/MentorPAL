eso. I've received several words through my time in the Navy. In my opinion,

 a lot of it's just, you know, I I I did my job and they were

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.760
 kind enough to give me an award after the fact. Eso I've gotten a number

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.070
 of Navy achievement medals have gotten some Navy commendation medals

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.370

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.680

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.980

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.590
 at any particular command.
