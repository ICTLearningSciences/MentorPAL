00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.450
the advice that I wish I had listened more to or I wouldn't exactly say

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.040
 it's advice that would listen more to it Beam or things that would

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.640
 have thought about a bit more and those those would have been, Maybe

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.240
 not being so worried about, uh, where my career trajectory would be

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.830
 if I decided not to take specific jobs and decided to do something

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.430
 that was a bit more may be interesting or beneficial to me. Personally.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.020
 I've had a good career and I've enjoyed what I've done. But there's

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.620
 some things that I passed up that I wish I had. Not even if it

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.220
 was just applying for those things on DDE had the option to take him.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.810
 Uh, I think that's that would have been something I would have take

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.410
 more, take more advantage of
