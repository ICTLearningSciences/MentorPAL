00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.930
My name is Lieutenant Commander David Barnhill on 37 years old, and I'm

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.010
 an aviator in the United States Navy. I grew up in Greensboro, North

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.100
 Carolina. I went to high school at Southwest Guilford High School.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.180
 My dad is a is an investment broker. My mom was a ST stayed at home,

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.260
 but she also did thinks, except to taught things like that. Growing

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.340
 up, we didn't move around very much. We only moved once to my recollection,

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.430
 and my parents are actually still in that house in North

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.510
 Carolina. In high school, I had multiple options. A sw far is where

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.590
 I wanted to go to college. A lot of public universities. My dad would

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.670
 not pay for anything. Private eso. I sought out a Navy Rossi scholarship,

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.760
 and I also applied to the United States Naval Academy and West

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.840
 Point. I got into all of those schools, uh, to include UNC Chapel

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.920
 Hill, North Carolina State University, University of Colorado, Boulder

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.000
 and I got as well a cz Virginia Tech. I got ah Rossi scholarship

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.090
 to UNC Chapel Hill, but my junior year I decided that my goal was going

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.170
 to be together. The United States Naval Academy with a backup of

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.250
 West Point. I decided that year that I wanted to join the military,

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.330
 which was kind of odd for our family, because we didn't have a long

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.410
 tradition of military service. As far as I know, there are only two

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.500
 people in my family that served in the military and both of them or

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.580
 my grandfather's. One of them was a CB in the United States Navy,

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.660
 and the other one was in the Army, and I'm not entirely sure what he

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.740
 did. But both of them served in World War Two in different capacities.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.830
 So my junior year, I I decided to apply to the Naval Academy on,

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.910
 and I found out in the fall of my senior year that I was accepted,

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.990
 and that was said and done everything else every other place was then

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.070
 put on hold, and I was looking for to go into the Naval Academy in

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.160
 the summer of 2000 won ignore. Like every other student, there spent

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.240
 four years of the Naval Academy upon going there, I thought for sure

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.320
 that I was going to be a sub Mariner. That was what I thought I wanted

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.400
 to do. But then, after some careful, deliberate and perhaps some

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.490
 wise words given from some other people, I decided the aviation was

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.570
 the better choice. And that was also my goal for pretty much the

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.650
 rest of my time at the Naval Academy, I studied history at the Naval

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.730
 Academy, which is somewhat odd because it is a technical school. But

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.810
 I took enough courses, Ah, to get myself a bachelor of science, which

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.900
 is someone abnormal from any other college you might go to. Normally

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.980
 we get a bachelor of arts. I minored in the Russian language, and

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.060
 the Naval Academy sent me to Russia twice to study for about a month

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.140
 each time, only staying with families there to get a bit better.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.230
 Handle the Russian language. As of now, I have spoken zero Russian

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.310
 since I last left the Naval Academy. Upon graduation, as I said, a selected

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.390
 aviation, I spent about three months at the Naval Academy after

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.470
 graduation, and then I went down to Pensacola, Florida, for flight

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.560
 training. It was pretty difficult for me. I did well, but it required

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.640
 me to put a lot of time to study after I at the end of my time

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.720
 down in Pensacola. I ended up selecting helicopters as my community

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.800
 and I went through the training pipeline and about a about a year and

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.890
 1/2 after I finished basic flight training from there, I moved to

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.970
 San Diego. Prior to moving, I got married to my wife, whom I met at

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.050
 the Naval Academy. She was not in the Naval Academy, but she was working

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:25.130
 in Washington, D. C. At the time. So we both moved to San Diego

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.210
 to finish up my training before I went to my first operational duty

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.300
 station. My after I finish training in San Diego, which if you ever

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.380
 get the chance of going to San Diego, you should, uh I then went to

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.460
 Japan. What I found odd about going to Japan is that no one seemed

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.540
 to really want to go there. Always kind of felt like being in the military

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.630
 gave you the opportunity to see all kinds of things, but it seemed

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.710
 like to me most people wanted to stay in the continental United

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.790
 States, and that's totally understandable because there's a lot of

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.870
 stability in that choice. However, I had the opportunity to go to Japan

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.960
 is a mid shipment, and I knew that that was the place I wanted

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.040
 to go. After some careful convincing, my wife agreed to it. I think

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.120
 you could talk to her and she would say it was one of the better decisions

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.200
 we've made Being in the in the with us, both with us being in

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.280
 the Navy. I spent three years in Japan where I deployed, depending

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.370
 how you calculate it. Six times multiple ships. So two different aircraft

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.450
 carriers I, and three different destroyer class ships and tone

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:51.530
 in total assessment about a year and 1/2 out at sea with several other

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:56.610
 small land based of detachments around Japan while we were there

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.700
 after leaving after at the end of my time in Japan for we selected

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:06.780
 to go to a training, a kind of training command in Fallon, Nevada is

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.860
 called a naval strike in our warfare center, and I hate to describe

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:16.940
 it like this, but it is where Top gun is located, and basically I was

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:22.030
 was part of the school that taught advanced tactics to helicopter

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:27.110
 aviators, so usually you would have more advanced aviators come through

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:32.190
 and we would help hone their skills and that that they learned

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:37.270
 as junior officers. After 3.5 years in Fallon, we then decided to go

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:42.360
 back to Japan for a second tour. We spent about a year and 1/2 or maybe

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.440
 just under two years in Japan. The second time at the time, I was

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.520
 put on the carrier wing staff where I was responsible for helicopter

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.600
 operations in and around the Carrier Strike Group. While there,

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.680
 uh, we had our second child. We had a first child. Well, weird Fallon

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.770
 at her second child in Japan. Uh, this this experience being in Japan

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:12.850
 with Children was far different than the 1st 1 It was more difficult,

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:17.930
 still provided a lot of different good opportunities, but it was

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:23.010
 definitely more of a challenge. And I believe my wife would say something

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:28.100
 similar that we did after we finished our tour in Japan, the

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:33.180
 second tour in Japan. We then moved to San Diego for what we call

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:38.260
 the department head to her. I was in charge of various departments within

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:43.340
 an aviation squadron. Uh, probably one of the more challenging

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:48.430
 leadership roles that I had have had in the since being in the Navy,

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:53.510
 but one of more rewarding things I've done as well. Uh, at the end

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:58.590
 of my time as a department head, I decided it was time for me to go

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:03.670
 to school, and soon I'm now a student at the Naval Postgraduate School

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:08.760
 studying Operations Research, which is a combination of data, science,

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:13.840
 data analysis and various types of statistics and optimization.
