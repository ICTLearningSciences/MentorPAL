I do not think there's ever a time where you should simply handle it yourself.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.680
 Uh, let me let me start that over. I do not. If sexual, if

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:17.100
 inappropriate sexual behavior is occurring in your unit, there's never

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.520
 a time you should simply handle it yourself. Uh, now there's there

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.930
 might be a difference in perception. What that is, whether it's two

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.350
 of your sailors, that air that have established a relationship, or

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.770

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.190

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.600
 be elevated, Um, in order to in order for folks in order for it to

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.020
 be handled appropriately.
