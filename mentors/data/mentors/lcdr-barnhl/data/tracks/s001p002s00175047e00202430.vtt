00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.150
emotions are a tricky thing in leadership positions. Emotions showing

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.460
 emotion and distaste, for instance, are not good when you're being asked

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.760
 to do something hard or difficult that no one's gonna like. You

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.070
 really just have to toe the line. Um, whether you believe in it or

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.370
 not, If you need to let off steam and talk about how much you don't

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.680
 like what you're doing, you need to find a pier or maybe even a superior

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.980
 to talk to about it. But showing that to your subordinates in that

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.290
 situation is not. I would not advise that, however, emotion is a

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.590
 good thing when we're talking about, uh, maybe not day to day situations.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.890
 But when something good happens, being happy for someone is human.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.200
 That's appropriate. Being angry for someone because something

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.500
 bad happened. Them is also human. It shows support. It makes you relatable.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.810
 Uh, stories also help very much with making you relatable. You

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.110
 talk to any person has been in the military for longer than 10 years,

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.420
 maybe in five years, and they will have accumulated a vast cache

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.720
 of stories that they will willingly tell you that will that may or

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.030
 may not have a point, but at least it gives you a perspective on what

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.330
 that person went through on something that you might be able to use

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.640
 in your own and that support it may be able to use in how they're

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.940
 going to operate in the military. I routinely rely on stories, Thio

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.240
 explain myself when I'm talking to us and talking to a subordinate.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.550
 I think one reason for that is when you're talking about you know how

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.850
 things theoretically should work and the ethereal you can always

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.160
 come up. A person can always come up with a reason why that may not

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.460
 be the case. But if you tell a story that is mostly grounded in fact,

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.770
 uh, it's hard to dispute that. And if you have an experience that

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.070
 someone can take with them and think about, then that that has much

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.380
 more of an impact than just saying we should do something because it

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.680
 is the way it is. If you can show why that goes a long way
