00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.620
the types of risk that you have to take in, being in the military or innumerable

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.380
 and subject to the type of community that you're in. But

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:18.150
 generally speaking, one of the one of the roles that you take on when

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.910
 becoming commission is you become a decision maker and there's always

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.680
 a risk in decision making. And some people are very comfortable

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.440
 making decisions, other people or not, but nonetheless you, even if

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.210
 you're uncomfortable with it, you are a decision maker. I've had those

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.970
 decisions might come and just how you're gonna handle your helicopter

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.740
 when you're flying around tomorrow to decisions that allow you

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:58.500
 plenty of time to think about it. Um, I think it's important to realize

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.270
 that the risk in decision making isn't what your commanding officers

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:10.030
 think of you, though That comes into play, certainly, but it's

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.800
 more of, uh, that there might be multiple ways to do something correctly,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.560
 and that's okay. Uh, a lot of times we think of decision in terms

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.330
 of risk of what other people might think. Did we do the right thing?

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.090
 Well, there might be multiple right things, and it's hard to to

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.860
 think about it in that particular context. Um, but all told, you're

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.620
 going encounter so many different types of risk throughout your career.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.390
 I think risk and decision making is probably the most important

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.150
 thing to consider as you start out.
