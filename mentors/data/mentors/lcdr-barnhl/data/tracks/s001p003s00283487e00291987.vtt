There is plenty of work that isn't very invigorating or interesting that

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.850
 you're going to deal with. You got to do a lot of paper filing a

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.350
 lot of just putting ah, different forms together to get signed, to maintain

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.850
 qualifications for people as very thankless. But part of the

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.350
 reason it's easy to get those things done is because the consequences

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.850
 of that stuff not being done a fairly dire if someone doesn't get

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.350
 there, they're flying paperwork, training, paperwork signed off by

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.850
 the commanding officer. Then they can't fly, and that's not an acceptable

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.350
 situation. So even if it's boring, it's pretty easy to make it

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.850
 happen.
