00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.120
So we ask if, if there's a time when breaking the rules is okay, that's,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.390
 Ah, it seems like a very easy answer. Say no. It's never OK to break

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.670
 the rules, but in the military you'll find that you'll find yourselves

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.940
 in situations that end up being very gray. My example is flying

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.210
 an aircraft. You're given a very large book to read that tells you

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.480
 how to fly an aircraft, and it tells you this is how you handle this

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.760
 emergency procedure and it gives you warnings that gives you cautions

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.030
 that gives, you know, it's a lot of advice on how to handle this,

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.300
 But in the very beginning of that section of the book, it says these

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.570
 air the procedures that you should use her in an emergency, but

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.850
 they are not a substitute for sound judgment. Sometimes sound judgment

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.120
 requires you to break the rules, and I don't mean in an intentional

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.390
 sense where you're just trying to get ready for an inspection and

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.660
 you gun deck all the signatures. I'm talking about breaking the rules.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.940
 I'm talking more about exceptional situations where you where you

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.210
 have really no other choice, maybe because the safety of the crew.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.480
 That's the other part of that statement in the book. You're the most

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.750
 important thing about your decision making is the safety of the air

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.030
 crew at that particular point time. And that might drive you to break

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.300
 the rules. So it s Oh, that would be a situation where you could

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.570
 break the rules. But But if you're going to do it, you need to have

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.840
 a very good reason why you are. It should not be the go to almost the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.120
 rules we have are developed over, you know, two centuries of experience.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.390
 There's a reason why they exist, even though we might not totally

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.660
 understand it. So going when going with going in with the game

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.930
 plan that every that rules are breakable, is not is not safe, It's

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.210
 not ideal. It should be considered. This is the way I'm gonna do it

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.480
 unless I find myself in it in a particular situation. And those, like

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.750
 I said, those situations are exceptional.
