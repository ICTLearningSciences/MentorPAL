00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.600
one of the normal ways we we try and identify strengths and weaknesses

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.340
 of of a group is through counseling, and oftentimes it comes through

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.090
 introspection of the individual person. So in counseling will often

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.840
 ask the person to provide three things they're good at and three things

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.580
 that they could do better. And this can lead to some discussions

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.330
 about, uh, you know what they can work on and what they on and how

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.070
 they can make these to make these things happen. So that's that's

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.820
 that's one idea that you may be able to use.
