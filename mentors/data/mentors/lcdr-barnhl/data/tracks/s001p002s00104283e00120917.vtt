00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.390
your relationship with your subordinates should be respectful, but you

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.940
 need to be approachable. If they have a problem, you need to be available.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.480
 That's part of the nature of being in the military, and it's

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.030
 one of the unique things about being in the military. Not only are

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.570
 you concerned about the professional aspects of someone's life, you're

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.120
 you need to be concerned about the personal side of, uh, your subordinates

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.660
 life. If they have trouble, that means you're gonna They're

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.200
 gonna have trouble If they have trouble at home. That means they're

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.750
 probably have trouble work. They're very dealing with things outside

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.290
 of work. Then you know they can't be there to do their job. It sounds

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.840
 it sounds very. Perhaps, you know, non altruistic Thio. Reach out

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.380
 to somebody and try and help them just because you want them built

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.920
 a work. But it doesn't really come across that way. I mean, naturally,

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.470
 I think humans care about other humans just because, and that's

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.010
 the type of thing you need to inculcated in your in your command or

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.560
 just leadership position. So you need to be approachable. You need

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.100
 to show that you care about your subordinates But you also need to show

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.650
 that there's going to be disciplined in your unit and there are

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.190
 various ways that you could do that.
