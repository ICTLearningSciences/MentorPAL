00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.790
you'll consistently have opportunity to hone your skills throughout your

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.730
 career. The Navy is is one big continuing education continuum. Um,

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.670
 in the aviation community, you will have to fly all the time for at

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.610
 least a lot, which requires you to maintain your skills in that respect.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.550
 But as far as leadership is concerned, you know leadership is

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.490
 very nebulous concept. In some ways, uh, the best way to hone your

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.430
 skills and continuing to hone your skills is to is to engage people

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.370
 that have that have been there before that have done those things before.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.300
 You can do this by talking directly to them, and I'm speaking

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.240
 mainly like your your superiors, perhaps, but you can also read, read,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.180
 read books by people who have been in those been those types of positions

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.120
 before and gain their leadership experience. That's one thing

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.060
 that is not explicit in the Navy and that you know, how do you develop

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.000
 leadership skills? Well, oftentimes will say, Well, it's an art,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.940
 not a science, so that's that requires just basically exposure to

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.880
 different types of way of doing things to make those skills better
