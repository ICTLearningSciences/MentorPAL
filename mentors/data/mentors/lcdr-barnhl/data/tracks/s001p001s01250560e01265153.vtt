00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.150
they're different methodologies to avoid Fran ization. Well, we'll say

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.440
 about the aviation community is that when you're flying in an aircraft,

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.740
 in my case, when you're flying with three other people, you have

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.040
 to have a good report with one another. So a lot of times it might

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.330
 be a touch more personal in some respects than in other communities.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.630
 Don't get me wrong. The differentiation between officer and Enlisted

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.930
 exists and is should be apparent. But it's just a little bit different

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.220
 because if you have a problem in an aircraft, if one person has

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.520
 a problem in the aircraft you all have a problem in the aircraft.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.810
 You're all in it together, right? And that requires a certain level

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.110
 of, of, of respect and understanding that, you know, despite the rank

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.410
 differences, you're all people, and you're all you gotta y'all. You

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.700
 all have to come together to make the mission work. But as faras delineating

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.000
 that you gotta rely heavily on your again on your committee.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.300
 Your non commissioned officers, those non commissioned officers

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.590
 have a significant amount of experience that they've seen and they can

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.890
 help you draw the line of what isn't isn't okay you need the leverage

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.190
 that experience professionally, but he also need to make it clear

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.480
 that you are the officer and the superior without doing it disrespectfully.
