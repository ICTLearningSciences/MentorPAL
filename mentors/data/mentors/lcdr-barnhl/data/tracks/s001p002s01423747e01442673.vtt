00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.600
if you have problems in your command, Uh, you before you go external to

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.350
 the command and talk about you getting advice from specialist, the

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.100
 first thing you do is elevated elevate the problem specifically to

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.850
 the commanding officer because he's ultimately the arbiter. Something

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.600
 such things. Now you as you're elevating this problem, you can explain

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.350
 him that you have a good idea on who to reach out to. But sometimes

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.100
 simply reaching out is not the right thing to do because there

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.850
 are other implications there. So So it's There are times to reach out,

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.600
 especially if you have. If you eso won. A good example is you have

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.350
 an aircraft crash. You know you're going to have to reach out a specialist

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.100
 on that. If you're part of the investigation team, that is

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.860
 a fact that's natural. Uh, but if it's something you're not sure about,

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.610
 there should be a healthy discussion in the squatter before reaching

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.360
 out to the specialist to determine what to do. Now, if you're talking

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.110
 more along the lines of something happens within the squatter

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.860
 and you think you can handle it with the skill professionals in your

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.610
 unlisted ranks, that's a little bit different. I don't think you should

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.360
 ever be afraid to reach out to The folks that are working on your

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.110
 aircraft are working on your machines, on the ships or anything

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.860
 like that to get their opinion on how they would particularly handle

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.610
 something like that. When you talk when you're talking about, ah, skill

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.360
 set, no matter what, you need, the advice of people like that to

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.110
 help you make the distant those types of decisions.
