the Navy has what's called the exceptional family member program, E f

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.430
 M. And if your family, if a member of your family contracts some sort

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.720
 of problem that is considered high risk, they won't let you go to

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.010
 certain duty stations. And if it occurs while added duty station, they'll

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.300
 do an assessment. And either, I mean, one thing that could happen

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.590
 is the They could make the family move while the member stays in

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.880
 place. Um, and there might be a possibility of the entire family moving

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.170
 if it's a mid tour. But that's unlikely. They'd be more likely

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.460
 to just have, say, the members family move, um, and the members stay

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.750
 in place and finish the tour.
