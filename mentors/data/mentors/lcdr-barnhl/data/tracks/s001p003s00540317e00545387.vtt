00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.460
when you move to a new place. Oh, are in the process of moving to a new

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.070
 place. A lot of it's very formalized. S o. You know, there's definitely

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.680
 a procedure for doing it if you stay organized than very few things

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.290
 really willful. Uh, you do need to think about the important papers

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.900
 that you're going to take with you. That could be a bit. That

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.500
 can be a bit cumbersome if you realize that you needed something and

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.110
 then you ended up packing it away. Because once you send your stuff

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.720
 away, you're not going to see it for a decent amount of time. How long

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.330
 it takes you to move. So So just anticipating the things you're

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.940
 gonna need now your new duty station before your household goods shipments

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.550
 arrive is a good thing to think about
