00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.540
it's hard to say exactly how in the hell military service transfers, Um,

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.240
 sometimes it does very nicely, Uh, and but other times not so much,

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.930
 I think people value the leadership skills you get for sure. But

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.620
 you gotta keep in mind just because you fly aircraft like me. That doesn't

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.310
 automatically mean people value flying aircraft they probably

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.010
 Valium or the fact that you've managed people and lead people in difficult

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.700
 situations. So if there's anything that really transfers to

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.390
 civilian life, that's it. But you also have to keep in mind and keep

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.090
 in mind. I am still in the Navy, and I'm not in this in civilian life.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.780
 Uh, the way you interact with people subordinate specifically in

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.470
 the military is probably different than how you interact with them

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.160
 in civilian life, right? Probably less direct. And the demanding nature

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.860
 of the Navy doesn't transfer terribly well to civilian life. I would

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.550
 think
