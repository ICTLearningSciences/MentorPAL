00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.700
I have never had to specifically be in charge of civilians, but I've had

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.550
 to have encountered them. Um, and, you know, day to day experience,

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.400
 You have to realize that military members have various standards

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.250
 that they have to hear to. And because you are a military member, you

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.100
 have to adhere to them, too. So you know them like you know what the

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.940
 standards are. In some cases, you're not sure what the standards

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.790
 are for the civilian employees. The one thing I keep coming back to

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.640
 regards of who you're working with are working for is the idea of respect.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.490
 If you're respectful of somebody and a lot of times, I'll go

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.340
 out of the way their way to help you, whether they're military or civilian.
