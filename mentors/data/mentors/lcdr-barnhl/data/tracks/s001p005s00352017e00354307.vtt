00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.430
So, to my recollection, there's no formal report if there is a perceived

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.010
 suicide risk, because that's somewhat subjective. Um, if they're,

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.590
 if someone has tried to commit suicide, then perhaps there is. But

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.170
 I would recommend you take a look at Navy directives Thio figure out

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.750
 when that is.
