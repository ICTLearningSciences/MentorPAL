00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.820
what you need to remember about your family as it is. Just that is your

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.800
 family. It is not the military. Things that are problematic is our

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.770
 about military culture. As related to the family is the member can

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.750
 often be. I could speak to myself. You won't be very direct about things

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.720
 that's a distinctly military quality. There's not necessarily appropriate

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.700
 for the family he needs to. You need to be a bit more sympathetic

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.670
 than you might otherwise be. If you're in the military when

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.650
 you're dealing with your family and basically you just have to temper

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.620
 their responses, you might have if, uh when it when you're dealing

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.600
 with your family because, like I said, they aren't in the military.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.570
 Some good things that occur from the military experience spirits is

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.550
 that you know you can. It's a bit easier to instill discipline and

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.520
 your Children early. Show them what it's like. Um, that is definitely

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.500
 a good thing that I found with my own kids on. That's not, I mean,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.470
 like disciplining them was just showing them how to act. Uh, character.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.450
 There's definitely accessible in the civilian world, but it's

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.420
 just right out in front of you. In the military paradigm
