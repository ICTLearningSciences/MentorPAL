There's not always a guarantee that you're gonna find a good mentor. There

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.590
 are people that I thought would be good mentors for me that didn't

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.460
 turn out. So not because they would have been bad. But we just never

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.330
 established a report. But I think that's the key. If you want to

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.200
 have some one be your mentor than you need to engage them, he cannot

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.070
 wait for them to engage you. Otherwise you're probably gonna miss

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.940
 out.
