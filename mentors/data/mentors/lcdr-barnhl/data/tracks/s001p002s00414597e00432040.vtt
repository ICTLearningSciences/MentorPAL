00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.570
I have never worked in the private sector, but I can into it a couple

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.290
 things, the camaraderie that comes with being in the military. And while

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.010
 it said probably, Well, we might be talking about the public sector

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.740
 more broadly, my experiences in the military. So that's what I'm

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.460
 gonna lean on. You build a lot of camaraderie in the military, and

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.180
 that may occur in the private sector, but I think it's less likely

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.900
 to happen. Uh, you don't necessarily. I mean, some of the greatest friendships

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.620
 I have I developed over the years or with people that I worked

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.340
 with and Japan especially, and the people you work with are the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.070
 people you play with two s o. So, you know, and that's that's kind

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.790
 of unique. Um, I'm not sure that's the case in the private, the private

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.510
 sector. You might have friends that you work with, Uh, but you

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.230
 don't have the same camaraderie and report you don't. You might not

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.950
 have the same sense of purpose. You saw purpose. Perhaps not the same

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.670
 sense of purpose that you develop. Uh, I think I think one of the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.390
 one of the ideas affecting is affecting This is the is the expected

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.120
 conformity that comes with being in the military. No, You're expected

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.840
 to think a lot of the same things. Um, and you know that I think that

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.560
 might go a long way to explaining some of this some of this camaraderie.
