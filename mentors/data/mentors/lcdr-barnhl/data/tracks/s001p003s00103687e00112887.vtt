00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.350
Well, the one failure that I has had the most impact is is being in a

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.850
 helicopter crash. That was my fault. But there are certainly some other

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:20.350
 smaller failures that you had had an impact. But I was I think I

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:26.850
 was fortunate enough to have bosses that didn't see a singular failure

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:33.350
 as a trend. Um, and it wasn't automatically assumed that I was bad

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.850
 at my job. Uh, hold on all I have had a pretty successful career,

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.350
 and I've done pretty well. Um, so I mean, the one that certainly sticks

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.850
 out is surely the helicopter crash.
