00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.380
The person that gave me the best advice about my career was a department

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.900
 head I had during my first year tour. We were having a discussion

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.430
 in the wardroom before a flight, and we started talking about what

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.960
 might what it might want to do after this. And this was very early on

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.480
 in my jail, too, and I didn't really think anything of it basically

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.010
 told him like, You know, if things work out and I get to my next job,

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.540
 then I get to do a production tour or a good job, then that's great.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.060
 If I don't, then that's fine, too. So we went ahead and had the

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.590
 flight. And then the next day I sat down with him. We just happened

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.110
 to sit down, he said. He told me, Uh, Dave, What you should dio is

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.640
 always regard. So what? You want to dio always say that you're interested

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.170
 in the career path? Don't give any indication that you're not

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.690
 on. I think that kind of served me well cause you should still keep

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.220
 your cards close because people have to make decisions about where you're

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.750
 gonna go. And if you show a disinterest, then they will take that

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.270
 to heart when comparing it to someone else who might show a very

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.800
 vigorous interest into remaining on the career path. So you need to

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.330
 think about bio means. Consider the alternatives. But don't take away

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.850
 the option to remain on the career path because once you're off it,

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.380
 it's very, very difficult to get back on.
