WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.120
probably is definitely shift as you move through your career. And he it

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.380
 is a balance you learn to balance is really what it comes down to

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.650
 in your professional life. Things change and your personal life things

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.910
 change. You get married, you have kids. Um, professionally, you become

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.180
 responsible for more and more things or people. Uh, so your priority

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.440
 becomes less about you and Maura about the people that are working

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:37.710
 for you or the people that you associate yourself with and you,

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.970
 and it's not just simply taking care of everybody, but at the same

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.240
 time, you need to be able to offer an appropriate work life balance.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.500
 Because if you're not doing okay, if you're if you're not prioritizing

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.770
 yourself in some way, shape or form, you're it's gonna be detrimental

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.030
 to everybody that's working for you or as well as everybody that's

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.300
 associated with you personally that rely on you. Okay, so, uh,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.560
 priorities definitely shift, um, into to summarize. Specifically, they

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.830
 shift in a way that you become more focused on the people that work

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.090
 for you as opposed to yourself. But then you also have to keep in

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.360
 mind that priority of yourself so that you don't get so run down that

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.620
 you can't effectively lead your subordinates
