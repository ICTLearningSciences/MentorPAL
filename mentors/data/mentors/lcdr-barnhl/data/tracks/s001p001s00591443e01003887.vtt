00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.820
Well, I never thought that I would be studying when I'm studying at school.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.780
 Uh, one of the one of my goals being in the Navy was to get a

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.750
 graduate degree of some sort and hopefully use it while in the Navy.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.720
 But I don't know what it was gonna be. I found myself, and now I find

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.690
 myself in a program of study that is far different than what I was

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.650
 doing when I was in undergraduate studies, doing a lot of math, a

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.620
 lot of very a lot of computing and stuff and and different things like

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.590
 that. And that is not something I expected at all when I first joint

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.550
 and when I graduated from the Naval Naval Academy from a, uh, from

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.520
 a purely operational standpoint. In no way she performed it. I think

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.490
 I was gonna end up being qualified to fly unmanned aircraft. Um,

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.450
 And to be clear, there is no glory and flying unmanned aircraft in

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.420
 the United States Navy. But there's a future in it, I think, in the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.390
 long term. So I did not think that I was gonna be involved with that.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.360
 I'd always heard about it. It was always kind of like this nebulous

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.320
 idea that could happen sometime. But I never actually thought that

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.290
 I would be involved in doing that.
