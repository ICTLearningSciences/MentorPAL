00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.930
There's not one clear indicator that will tell you if someone could be

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.010
 influenced or not. Usually it's through a time you know, a period of

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.090
 exposure to that person. Um, some people think the way they think

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.170
 and they're not willing to change it. You just have to accept that.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.240
 But I think it will become readily apparent that that is the case. The

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.320
 more time you spend with him, which is what you should be doing when

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.400
 you're talking about leadership, being a leader with your subordinates.
