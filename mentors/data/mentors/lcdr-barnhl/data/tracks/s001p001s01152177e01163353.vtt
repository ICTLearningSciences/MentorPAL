00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.370
leadership requires you to listen, especially to the people. You are subordinate

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.890
 to you If you don't listen to them, you have no perspective

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:17.410
 on what they're exactly having to deal with. There are times where

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.930
 you are going to have to go with what you believe is right, despite

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.450
 what your subordinates think. And being able to do that is important,

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.970
 too, and have. But having a balance between listening to your subordinates

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.490
 and then being able to make a decision. Using the information

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:45.010
 you have in the information that's being given to you is essential

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.530
 way often. Think of leaders just operating in a vacuum, but I really

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.050
 think they've just surrounded themselves with people that can give

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.570
 them good advice, and they themselves. The leaders are very good

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.090
 at parsing that advice and then making the decisions necessary for

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.610
 whatever type of position they're in.
