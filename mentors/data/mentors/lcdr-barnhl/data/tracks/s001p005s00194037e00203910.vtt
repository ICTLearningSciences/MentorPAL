Sometimes the signs of of of discrimination are pretty apparent. Sometimes

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.640
 it's just you can hear it in the normal office talk in your shops.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.530
 I've been fortunate enough to be in places where that has been very

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.430
 abnormal. People generally got along, and you do not see ingrained

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.320
 discrimination in the culture of the places I've been. But it does

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.220
 exist s so as far as things that give an indication. Usually you'll

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.110
 you'll hear something coming up from the enlisted ranks on that is

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.000
 filtered through your non commissioned officers. If you haven't been

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.900
 able to tell yet, the noncommissioned officer is your liaison with

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.790
 the enlisted ranks, and you should maintain a good relationship with

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.690
 them because they can give you some pretty good insight of what's

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.580
 happening in those ranks.
