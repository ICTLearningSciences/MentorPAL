00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.270
there is not one particular situation that I can think of where I be wood,

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.700
 I mean absolute happiness in the service. I think one of the things

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.120
 you need to consider is simply look at what you're doing and try

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.550
 and enjoy what you're doing right now. Right at this moment, don't

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.970
 look too far in the future. Anticipate the future. But don't don't

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.390
 look so far ahead that you're missing what you're doing right now, because

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.820
 you'll do a lot of incredible things. You'll do a lot of things

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.240
 that will frustrate you, too, but there's no really one way that

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.670
 will determine your happiness in the service other than just have a

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.090
 positive attitude about what you're doing.
