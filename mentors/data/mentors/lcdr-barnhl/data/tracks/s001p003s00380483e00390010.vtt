00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.100
they're couple things that you have to consider. If you don't qualify

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.350
 and in various forms, I would break this down into a couple situations.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.600
 First, you know whether you qualify or not to get your wings. Um,

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.860
 if that doesn't happen that often times you might just be redesignated

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.110
 to a different type of community. Um, if if you have gone your

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.360
 wings, but then there's a specific qualification that you have to get.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.610
 Once you reach your squadron, then you can ask to be redesignated.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.860
 But sometimes you're just going to get told that you need to qualify

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.110
 because you are needed as a person in that bill. It other times you

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.370
 might be sent to fill another specific job that perhaps they haven't

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.620
 been able to fill, and you don't get the choice of it. I've seen

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.870
 all three of those things happen to various people throughout my time

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.120
 in the Navy
