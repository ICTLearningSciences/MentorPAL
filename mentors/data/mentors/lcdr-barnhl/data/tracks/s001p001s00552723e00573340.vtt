00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.900
So what you see on television, a lot of times our ships and you prod or

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.940
 wide screen, you know, views of ships traveling through the ocean

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.990
 with very ominous music being played in the background. And then you

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.040
 that cuts to a scene and say combat in the combat room that they have

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.080
 on board and people making decisions at What are we going to dio

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.130
 about these terrorists in this place where we're gonna fire? Are we

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.180
 ready to fire missiles? And it's usually not that way. Usually you're

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.220
 not doing much of anything. You're out to sea just in case something

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.270
 happens. And that could be very trying. Uh, because you trim do all

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.320
 this training to do this one specific thing. And that's all you do.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.360
 A lot of times you can spend a whole tour and perhaps a whole career

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.410
 without doing the Maur glorified romanticized things missions that

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.460
 you think you're gonna be doing that could be somewhat difficult.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.510
 A good example of this is when your station in Japan, the primary point

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.550
 of the aircraft carrier out there, is it simply being there. It's

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.600
 not that you're not gonna go attack anybody. You're not gonna You're

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.650
 not gonna try and find terrorists to kill, but really, is the point

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.690
 of the point of the carrier out there is that it's there to keep

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.740
 in check anybody, any, any other entities out there. That might be

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.790
 ad for cereal. So and you said you spent a lot of time sitting a lot

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.830
 of time training, a lot of time waiting for things to happen. But when

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.880
 things do happen, it's very quick, and then it's over. So that's

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.930
 one of the things against romanticize about being in the military that

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.970
 you don't always. You don't always understand before you get in.
