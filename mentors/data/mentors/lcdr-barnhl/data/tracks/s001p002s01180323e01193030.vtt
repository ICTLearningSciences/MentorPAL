00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.650
leadership comes in all flavors. Um, I'm not sure. I would say that leadership

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:12.460
 styles are dying out, But what I would say is that we're we

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.260
 find failure anathema, right? It's it's not acceptable. But the reality

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.070
 is we all fail. We all have problems. We all do things that we

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.870
 wish we hadn't done. And they have an impact on other people. The acceptance

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:35.680
 that failure is a natural part of any career path of any experience

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.480
 in life. Failure is going to happen to everybody at some point,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.290
 and it's not whether a person failed or not. It's how we learn

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.090
 from that failure. That's where the Mercy Mercy comes in. As faras you

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.900
 know, a leader is concerned. Realizing this just because someone

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.700
 screwed it up doesn't mean they have nothing to add. No, if someone

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.510
 does something wrong, instead of sidelining him, perhaps embrace him,

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.310
 let him know that they did it wrong, but also let him know that they're

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.120
 still part of the team. They're still gonna be included, and they

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.920
 are part of the team's success. When that does come
