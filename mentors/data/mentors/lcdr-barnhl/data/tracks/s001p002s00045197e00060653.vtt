00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.820
the way I've connected with various teams and team members that I've had

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.790
 is basically just being open to them, listening to them. If you're

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.760
 the leader, though, you need to set expectation to be clear about

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.730
 what those expectations are. And if they're somewhat controversial,

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.700
 you need to be clear on why those expectations are the way they are.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.670
 You have to realize that the connection you're establishing is not

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.640
 necessarily appeared, appear. Relationship. It's a superior to subordinate

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.620
 relationship. Most of the time. The folks that work for you understand

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.590
 they're the subordinate and you're the superior. So that's

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.560
 kind of built into the into the relationship itself you need. But you

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.530
 still need to make sure that that is what you what you expect now

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.500
 within that as a leader. As I said before, you need to be willing to

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.470
 listen. Listen to their ideas, listen their frustrations. If you're

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.440
 willing to listen, that goes a long way into establishing a good report

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.410
 in connection with the folks that work with you and for you
