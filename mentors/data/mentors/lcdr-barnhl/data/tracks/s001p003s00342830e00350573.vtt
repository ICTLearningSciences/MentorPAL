00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.200
my biggest weakness used to be that argue might still be, uh, that the

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.540
 freighter, the fear that my decisions were not the right ones. But

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.890
 then I came to the conclusion that just because my decision wasn't necessarily

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.240
 the decision that another person might make it doesn't make

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.590
 it wrong. It just made it different. They're different ways to tackle

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.930
 the various problems. Um, and it just because someone does it differently

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.280
 doesn't make you wrong.
