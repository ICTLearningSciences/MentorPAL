00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.830
my name's lieutenant commander, David Barnhill. I'm an aviator in the

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.810
 United States Navy helicopter pilot by trade, but also fly drones. Uh,

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:15.790
 I've moved seven times since I've been in the Navy. Between training

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.780
 and operational deployments are duty stations. I graduated from

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.760
 the Naval Academy in 2005 with a degree in history and ah, minor and

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.740
 Russian language, which just shows that you do not need a technical

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.720
 major in order to be a pilot.
