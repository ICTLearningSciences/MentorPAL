00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.840
My first major leadership role was, I would say be being a detachment

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.820
 maintenance officer onboard a a destroyer. My first operational squadron

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.810
 was bigger relative to the other squadrons like it. So we had a

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.800
 few extra helicopters and few extra people, so we would put helicopters

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.780
 onboard smaller ships, vice aircraft carrier where the main body

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.770
 of the squadron would be. I the opportunity Thio do one of those detachments

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.750
 to do a detachment at least three times, but the one that

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.740
 was truly most rewarding, who was when I was the detachment maintenance

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.730
 officer? There was a lot of problem solving involved. There was

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.710
 a lot of interacting when the enlisted sailors and you, if you do it

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.700
 the right way, you find out what the enlisted sailors can teach you.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.690
 And I can tell you, without a doubt that the most important person

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.670
 on that ship for the aviation folks was my chief of the maintenance

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.660
 of the maintenance folks that were working for me. What you don't

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.650
 truly realize when you first get in the Navy as an officer is that you

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.630
 don't know everything. Um, especially when it comes to things like

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.620
 aircraft maintenance So you need a lot of guidance. And the people

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.600
 that give you those guidance give you that guidance. Are the chiefs

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.590
 and lead petty officers that accompany you. And if you do not listen

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.580
 to them, you're going to have a problem. So that was That was the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.560
 first major leadership opportunity I had, and probably one of the most

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.550
 important.
