00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.570
I think this is true for any officer. When when leading a team, the first

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.290
 thing you do is embrace them. Embrace the new team member. Be clear

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.020
 about what your expectations are of them. It may not be specific

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.740
 to their individual role, but what the with the intent of the team

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.460
 is, if you embrace them, your subordinates will oftentimes follow suit.
