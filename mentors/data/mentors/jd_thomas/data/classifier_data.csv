I love writing love, math and science and just enjoyed learning as I got older. Uh, the more I got into sports and the more I got into girls unless I focused on school. School came kind of easy to me in high school, so I can't remember too often like taking home a book because it came so natural to me. You know, I think my parents that helped me develop that foundation of, like being a quick learner and high school. I didn't have to study so much. College was kind of the same. I kind of felt, you know, fell in hard with the women and sports and less on studies. So I really didn't focus my year college until my senior year, which I was challenged by my mother.

s001p004s00040819e00043511,,"simple, simple way to track your tasks are thio. Maintain a planner, find a pocket planner and basically write down all your tasks and organize them. Keep them organized. You're going to write, I would say, Write down every task that you have, no matter how minuscule, matter how great, and transfer it over from day to day, and that will allow you to keep track of all your task.",How do you track all your tasks?
s001p004s00051410e00064915,,"all right. I've done number ways for you to decompress and actually slow down. Um, let's go with first by being at home. Home port? Well, being important. So you're on a ship and you're important. One way to decompress would be on the right home and a right to work. Used that quiet time to gather your thoughts, to focus your thoughts, to shift gears from being full throttle at work, to going home to re prioritizing things by being with your family. So keep this in mind. Never take your work home, Leave work at work. And so when you walk outside of that, uh, offer the quarterdeck, take your hard hat off, take cover off figuratively and leave it at work. So you go home, Go be with your family on that ride home. Decompress. Get those thoughts out. Think about things that you that don't involve work. And then when you get home, focus on your family while you're deployed, say, on the ship for a time period, you decompress by working out by doing and being actively engaged in certain hobbies that you might you might be involved in. I think about things like maybe playing video games, reading magazines, reading a book. There's, ah, brief period before you say you're about to go hit the rack for the night. Take about 20 minutes. Thio. You know, pray, read a book, watch a movie, watch video, watch something to help decompress prior to going to sleep.",How do you decompress/slow down?
s001p004s00092417e00114220,,"for me Flight school, it it could be looked at as a touch of situation. But for me, it's, Ah, a learning experience. Flight school didn't work out for me. For a multitude of reasons. I'm a very spiritual person. So when you when you attend a strenuous training environment such as flight school, you have to be 110% focused on achieving that goal. Um, I wasn't able to do that. So down there I was focused on a multitude of different things. That flight school kind of took a back seat. And by the time that it did take a front row seat, it was too late. I was unable to, uh, recover, and fortunately, I was able to regroup and move on to something else. Um, I think as in general as servicemen, you know, sailors and military, uh, people. I guess you could say we all have this this inner thoughts about this inner thought or this interview of ourselves as if we can accomplish any and everything but the reality, you know, we fail. Sometimes, Sometimes things just don't work out, and you have to develop that that outlook that sometimes things just don't go your way, and sometimes you fail. But the key here is when you fail, can you move on with a better outlook on what happened? You always have to look at a situation as a learning experience as some some look at something some in some way, shape or form as how do I improve off of this situation? And that's what I had to do. And that's what you'll be asked to do when whatever situation you're in doesn't go as planned, it's temporary and that you can move on and be, you know, be a better person at whatever it may be. You just hit a bump in the road and you can move forward.",Why didn't flight school work out?
s001p005s00005703e00012717,First Steps,"So in order to set the tone and to find that right tone, I think it's one in the same. You lead by example, um, and you leave with empathy. So if you're gonna understand how someone feels understand how it feels to be laid into a situation, you can better leave someone into a situation so lead by example and leading with company empathy will set the tone for just about any situation.",How do you set the tone as a leader? What is the right tone?
s001p005s00014818e00024016,First Steps,"common mistakes. I see new leaders make our I'm not listening and not observing. My mom would always say and she still says to this day, you listen, you have to our two years, two eyes and one mile, four reason. So listen and observe more than you speak on. I think new leaders doom or talking and less listening than than anything. And that's, ah, big mistake. Also, one more thing is that they so come to outside pressures, and by about falling into those pressures, they tend to rush themselves and skip steps, and that causes issues among team members and say throughout a command. So, um","What are the most common mistakes you've seen new leaders make? (e.g., skipping steps)"
s001p005s00025508e00033204,First Steps,"some problems that should be definitely rooted out would be ego. You're not bigger than the team. You're not bigger than the Navy. You're not more important. But you definitely have to root out your ego going into a situation being a leader in high school, I played football, so we had a LA logo or model. I'm sorry that I always say a big team Little me is The team is bigger than me. So take care ego out of that situation and, uh, everything well, kind of kind of flow.","What problems need to be rooted out early, or you'll have trouble fixing them later?"
s001p005s00035909e00050121,First Steps,"so to answer that question, I think it depends. It depends on the situation. It depends on what needs to take place out of the leader in that role. And also it depends on your experience and your knowledge of the situation, as well as the leaders of the senior petty officers, knowledge and experience in that situation. To bridge that gap and to move forward, you have to communicate early and often, and between yourself and that senior petty officer to kind of develop a understanding off of how he or she operates in a situation how you operate in a situation. It becomes like a marriage relationship between YouTube. Kind of like, you know, shack in Kobe. You know, Jordan and Pippen. You know, you work well together, you learn each other, and you kind of know when and where he or she will be and what they'll say and what needs to be said. And vice versa. Fire yourself",How much leadership should you take charge of versus letting your senior petty officer lead?
s001p005s00053118e00063718,First Steps,"you find that balance? Uh, with your team, you know, it's a It's a tricky situation is kind of tough because the people that should be leading and you'll be working with our will be around the same age. For example, when I was ah E three as an undesignated see me? I was 24 years old and my lieutenant division officer was 24 years old, so we shared a lot of of the similar interests. Sara, A lot of you know, common things amongst ourselves. But how do you find that that balances you? You just keep in mind that you're a lieutenant or you're an incident and he or she is a seaman Airman, First class, third class, second class. One more tidbit. Just keep in mind that you get paid on the 15 1st on the 15th of every month, and you don't want to jeopardize you know, your priorities at home for making a mistake out in the fleet",How do I balance being close with my team versus fraternizing?
s001p005s00065604e00075612,First Steps,"the first thing a leader must adjust who would be stress? This job and this career path is very stressful. So you will have to learn how to operate and live with stress. Constant nonstop stress. How do you do that? Um, you prioritize certain things and you learn new techniques. So one of those things would be time management. You have to learn how to balance your time between certain activities at work, certain stresses at work, certain things that work and learn when to shut him on and off, you know, accordingly. Um, also finding a time too, Uh, focus on yourself, which are mental and physical hill in your home life. So those things will help help a leader, balance and stress and time management.",What are the main things that a new leader must learn and adjust to?
s001p005s00084804e00095223,"Background,First Steps,Priorities","As my career progresses, I think I've found more balance. Early on, I was all career based career focused on, so if it didn't involve me progressing in the Navy, then I kind of put it on the back burner and I'm pretty sure I'll talk about a little bit later. But, um, I think as time is going on and I'm getting a little older, my priorities are kind of balancing out where I want Ah, home life as well as a an established career. So I was privileged to have a conversation with a senior once, and this is very recently and I would discuss retirement. And he mentioned not being the only one at my retirement and that kind of hit home as saying, like when you get older, you don't wanna focus so much on your career that you alien nature of friends and family to where you're the only one standing there at your retirement","How have your priorities changed as your career progresses?
Do you think differently now than you did at the start of your career?
Has your work shaped your priorities?
Have your priorities changed throughout your development?
In what ways have your priorities adapted to your career situation?
What priorities do you have now that you didn't have earlier in your career?"
s001p005s00101220e00112403,First Steps,"to make a change in the team were basically discussed and changing the culture s. So how do you change that culture? I would first say would be leading by example. The second thing would be be in prison So you can't change the culture by my not being there. So you have to be around the sailors. You have to be around the personnel. You have to be there when they're going through rough times. You have to be there during the best times. Change that culture. They're gonna look at you as an example of what to do and what not to do in situations. Uhm as time goes on and as you progress in your your tours you'll start to notice that sailors will watch every everything that you do and what you say. And eventually they'll come to you and ask you for advice, sir. How do I do this? Sir, if you were in this situation, what would you do? And that's how you change culture. It takes time, but you leave by example and you stay present You You will eventually move that culture on being a more positive and productive environment.",What does it take to really make a change in a team?
s001p005s00114321e00123723,JobSpecific,"my view of this line of work, it's it hasn't changed that much. Um, again, you just kind of go into each and every situation each and every tour, looking too affected positively and the things that you learn and the things the ordeals and experiences that you go through it you just take it on as a learning experience, something that you could add into your toolbox to help someone or something going forward. So my outlook on this career it is still the same still move, headed out to save the world or help someone save the work. And just to be in incorporate a positive and productive working environment in whatever command, a situation that I'm going into.","How has your view of this line of work changed over time?
Has your opinion of your job altered?
Has your view of this work changed and how?
Have you changed your opinion about this line of work and if so, how?
What about your attitude change concerning your profession?"
s001p005s00130415e00145528,"Advice,First Steps,Priorities,OTHER","all right. So for person entering this field, I'll give you three priorities. The first and these are from 1 to 3. It may sound counterintuitive or kind of backwards, but you hear me out, the first priority will be self care. You always have to take care of yourself so physically, Mentally, emotionally, spiritually, financially. All five of those things are you should take those into account. Um when in terms of these powers, number two will be your family and friends, Your family and friends were allowing you for support. So be there for them as best you can. With the time that you have. Don't neglect him. Don't push them away. If you have issues with them or problems amongst each other, do your best to work out those conflicts and move forward. Your time on here on land with them is limited. So you always have to be a sea Ships will be at sea. Ships will operate so your time is limited. So spend what time you have with your family and friends and you know, joyous occasions. Number three in terms of Navy number three is navy. The Navy is 1/3 priority in my book simply because you can't take care of the Navy if you don't first take care of yourself and to take care of your family. If you don't take care of number, want numbers one and two. Your focus will not be on the Navy's mission, so prioritize those three. I'll fry Tito. I prioritize those three like that. Um, yeah.","What priorities would you recommend for a person entering this field?
Are there things that would keep me from doing this?
What most important for me to do?
What should I do first if I want to do this?"
s001p005s00150901e00154724,First Steps,"There's probably the biggest skill that I would say I needed. Toe should have mastered before at least attempted to would be add me. Uh, the Navy and the military in general is very ad man paperwork heavy. So if you don't have a clear understanding of what what's required of you and how Thio managed that the admin side off being a leader, uh, you're definitely going to struggle, so that's one skill I wish I would have mastered early on.",What skills do you wish you had mastered before entering your profession?
s001p005s00155627e00170219,First Steps,"the one question I wish I would have asked earlier. Um, and it's also another question that I ask off a lot of seniors is how do you get, How do I get better? Two. In becoming the person I envisioned myself being once I retire. So I think we all as human beings want to be the best husband, wife, father, mother, aunt, uncle friend, uh, commanding officer, Master chief or whatever it may be, you want to be the best at it. You want to be good at it. You want to be looked at as being a a, uh, leader in that field in terms off. You know how people look up to you, a role model in that field. So that's one question that I I wish I would have asked myself early on, even in childhood, is How do I How do I improve? How do I get better? What things do I need to do to become a better person?",What is one question you wished you asked earlier?
s001p005s00171717e00184505,First Steps,"as you progress in your career, you'll be privileged to Maur, um, information. And yes, that's important, in a sense, but not in the sense that you may think of. Of the key here will be, too, is how do you discern what to relay and what not relate to your peers and to your family and to your sailors. So you may be on some very secret squirrel mission or whatever it may be wherever it may be, and you'll have to understand what to say and what not to say to these people because, you know, let's face it, we all work better when we know what we're what when we know what we're doing and why we're doing so if I understand that, Hey, I'm doing, I'm fixing this whatever piece of equipment it maybe in order to, uh, I don't know, accomplished some mission somewhere. Then I'll work a little bit more at it. I work just a little bit more hard. I'll pay a little bit more attention to it, so you, as a leader, will have to find that balance of how to motivate how to keep your sailors and your peers motivated. But at the same time not giving him up enough, not giving him too much information toe where it may be, ah, issue going forward.","As a leader, how much more will I know about the overall goals of the work I am doing?"
s001p005s00193109e00203206,"Challenges,Military,Training","The most difficult part is all my training would probably be being away from my friends and family. Um, I'm a very, uh loving, caring, family oriented person, so there interact my interaction with them daily. Weekly monthly, however it may be, plays a lot into my my psyche, so not being able to communicate with them as often as I like early on played a big part of it was very difficult for me to, uh, um, like, operate throughout training or conduct myself throughout training. But it's a part of the job being in this career path. You spend days, weeks, maybe even months without seeing you're seeing or being able to converse with your family and friends. So as time goes on, you learn to manage and you learn to deal with it.","What was the most difficult part of your training?
Was it hard to learn what you learned?

what was hard for you to master?"
s001p005s00210707e00214203,First Steps,"leading honorably is not. Trick is not difficult at all. Again, you lead by example. You do what, uh, you think is right. And my dad, he's every time I see him on when I leave home, he says the same thing. You know, stay true to yourself and do what's right. If you stay true to yourself and you do what's right, you communicate well. It's not. Not difficult, all the lead honorably, you'll never go wrong.",How you can lead honorably?
s001p005s00222312e00232508,,"conflict is normal all all around. A lot of people avoid it. Some people look forward to it, but conflict it's it's a part of job. Just imagine that you're you've got new personalities, different personalities, different people from all walks of life, all different backgrounds. I mean, it's Ah, it's kind of a Milton pot. So you put all of these people in one small area. You're bound to have a confident. The key here is to be able to solve that conflict and move forward and continue in a continue to operate in a positive and productive working environment. You don't have to be someone friends who worked with him just respect and respect them and be cordial. And that's how you just move forward. Just don't hold on to those negative issues and those negative thoughts in those, uh, those problems. Just solve it and move forward and just always be respectful","You are having a conflict in the first few days in your platoon, is that normal or no?"
s001p005s00250228e00264207,First Steps,"some good resource is to use before entering the fleet or wherever you may be hit. It would be to use your peers, use mentors. Those are two of my favorites. Asking questions from different and receiving different perspectives on certain situations always helps out. It's always a plus. Thio here, a mentor who's been in a situation, describe how they reacted on the things that the lessons they learned from being in certain situations. That's always a favorite of mine. There are tons of books and magazines and articles on leadership being in different situations. Look, look in the past, uh, there's a tons of situations off leaders and people throughout history who have gone through Ah, you know, different ordeals and experiences. Thio, you know, be successful as leaders. I took a class here at the Naval Postgraduate School my first quarter, and it discussed the, um, um, a disaster down on one of light headed towards like the Antarctica, an Arctic and about a group of sailors who were stuck down there for almost a year and 1/2 and the story revolved around the the Captain who got hit. He got his crew out of there So there are tons of resource that you used, Thio. You no further develop. But you again you have to take your ego out of it and listen and learn and read from a different perspective.","What are some good resources to look at before starting (books, videos, classes)?"
s001p006s00011104e00014411,JobSpecific,"most of my time at work was spent basically mentor or doing paperwork again. I kind of go by the notion toe lead by example on the way to impact a culture would be too have people seeing you doing with your request of them. And if they see you working, they're more inclined to work. They say you're doing the right thing. They're more inclined to do the right thing. So that's how I spent most of my time at work.",How do you spend most of your time at work?
s001p006s00043008e00044700,JobSpecific,"My first major leadership role in the Navy would be the repair officer role as an incident on the USS Lassen, but also I could compare that to being a big brother on and a role model throughout my community.",What was your first major leadership role?
s001p006s00072402e00085613,JobSpecific,"so on a typical day on the U. S. Has lasted as repair officer. My day typically started very early, anywhere from 4 to 5 a.m. dependent on the white schedule and depending on if we were in port or etc. Just kind of blend in a couple of things.
