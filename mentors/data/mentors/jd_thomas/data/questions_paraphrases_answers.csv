,,jd_thomas,How do you decompress/slow down?,our other number ways for you to %HESITATION decompress and actually slow down %HESITATION let's go with %HESITATION first Bobby is at home home port or being import so your ownership in your import %HESITATION one way to decompress will be on the route home in a right to work %HESITATION used that quiet time to gather your thoughts to focus her thoughts to shift gears from being in full throttle at work to going home to re prioritize things about being with your family so keep this in mind never take your work home leave work at work and so when you walk outside of that %HESITATION also recorded it take your hard hat off take cover Ralph figuratively and leave it at work so you go home go be with your family on the ride home decompress get those thoughts out think about things that you that don't involve work and then when you get home focus on your family %HESITATION while you're deployed say on the ship for a time %HESITATION you decompress by working now by doing this and it been actively engaged in certain hobbies that you might you might be involved in %HESITATION think about things like %HESITATION maybe playing video games read magazines read a book %HESITATION there's a a brief period before you say you're you're about to go hit the rack for the night %HESITATION take about twenty minutes to %HESITATION you know pre read a book %HESITATION watch a movie watch video watch something to have decompress prior to going to sleep 
,,jd_thomas,Why didn't flight school work out?,%HESITATION for me %HESITATION flight school of it will it it could be looked at as a touchy situation but for me it's %HESITATION a learning experience %HESITATION fly student work out for me for a multitude of reasons %HESITATION I'm a very spiritual person %HESITATION so %HESITATION when you when you attend a %HESITATION a strenuous training environment such as flight school you have to be one hundred and ten percent focused on achieving that goal %HESITATION I wasn't able to do that so down there %HESITATION was focused on a multitude of different things that fight flight school kind of took a backseat and by the time that it did take a bit of a front row seat it was too late I was on able to recover and fortunately I was able to regroup and move on to something else %HESITATION I think as in general as servicemen you know sailors and you know military %HESITATION %HESITATION all I guess you could say %HESITATION we all have this this inner thoughts about this inner thought or this interview of ourselves as if we can accomplish any and everything but the in reality you know we fail sometimes %HESITATION sometimes things just don't work out and you have to develop that that outlook that sometimes things just don't go your way and sometimes you fail but the key here is when you fail can you move on with %HESITATION a better outlook on what happened you always have to look at a situation as a learning experience as some some look at something some in some way shape or form as how do I improve off of this situation and that's what I had to do and that's what you'll be asked to do when whatever situation you're and doesn't go as planned it's temporary and that you can move on and be %HESITATION you know be a better person that whatever it may be you just hit a bump in the road you can move for 
,,jd_thomas,How do you set the tone as a leader? What is the right tone?,so the in order to set the tone and %HESITATION to find the right tone I think it's one in the same %HESITATION you lead by example %HESITATION and you leave with %HESITATION empathy so if you can understand how someone %HESITATION feels RV you understand how it feels to be led into a situation you can better lease someone into a situation so lead by example and leading with ebony empathy will set the tone for just about any any situation 
,,jd_thomas,"What are the most common mistakes you've seen new leaders make? (e.g., skipping steps)",our common mistakes are see new leaders make our %HESITATION %HESITATION not listening and not observers %HESITATION my mom would always say she still says to this day %HESITATION you listen you have to out two years two eyes and one mouth for a reason so listen and observe more than you speak %HESITATION nothing new leaders do more %HESITATION talking and less listening then then anything and that's a big mistake %HESITATION also one more thing is that they succumb to outside pressures and by six about falling into those pressures they tend to rush themselves and skip steps and that causes issues %HESITATION Amman team members and say throughout a command so %HESITATION 
,,jd_thomas,"What problems need to be rooted out early, or you'll have trouble fixing them later?",%HESITATION some problems that should be definitely rooted out would be ego of you're not bigger than the team they're not bigger than the navy you're not more important but you definitely have to root out your ego going to a situation being a leader %HESITATION and high school %HESITATION well play football so we had a lot of local or model I'm sorry that %HESITATION always see a big team little me is the team is bigger than me so take your ego out of that situation %HESITATION everything will come out kind of slow 
,,jd_thomas,How much leadership should you take charge of versus letting your senior petty officer lead?,so to answer that question I think it it it depends %HESITATION it depends on the situation it depends on what needs to take place out of %HESITATION the leader in that role and also depends on your experience and your knowledge of the situation as well as the leaders of the %HESITATION senior petty officer's knowledge and and experience in that situation %HESITATION to bridge that gap and to move forward you have to communicate early in office and between yourself and that senior petty officer to come to vote okay understanding of of how he or she operates in the situation how you operate in a situation it becomes like a %HESITATION a marriage relationship between you two %HESITATION kind of like a you know Shaq and Kobe you know Jordan and Pippen you know you work well together you learn each other and you kind of know when and where he or she will be and what they'll say and what needs to be see and vice versa for your yourself 
,,jd_thomas,How do I balance being close with my team versus fraternizing?,%HESITATION you find a balance %HESITATION with your team you know I I is this is this is a tricky situation is kind of tough %HESITATION because the people to to be leading and you'll be working with our will be around your the same age %HESITATION for example when I was %HESITATION eat three as and as they seem I was twenty four years old and my lieutenant division officer was a twenty four years ago so we share a lot of the similar interests %HESITATION Serra a lot of loans you know common things amongst ourselves of but how do you find that that balances you rip you just keep in mind that you're a lieutenant or your Nancy and here she is a C. man %HESITATION err man first class third Class second class %HESITATION and other than one more to better just keep in mind that you get paid on the fifteenth first on the fifteenth of every month and you don't want to jeopardize you know your %HESITATION priorities at home for making a mistake out in the flea 
,,jd_thomas,What are the main things that a new leader must learn and adjust to?,well the first thing a leader must adjust to would be stress %HESITATION this job in this career path is very stressful so you will have to learn how to operate and live with stress constant nonstop stress %HESITATION how do you do that %HESITATION you prioritize certain things that you learn new techniques so one of those things would be time management %HESITATION you have to learn how to balance your time between certain activities at work search stresses that were certain things that work and learn when to shut him on and off you know accordingly %HESITATION also finding a %HESITATION time to %HESITATION focus on yourself Mr mental and physical health %HESITATION and your home life so those things will help helpful leader %HESITATION bounces stress and time management 
,,jd_thomas,How have your priorities changed as your career progresses?,because my career progresses %HESITATION I think I've found more balance %HESITATION %HESITATION early on I was all career based on career focused on that %HESITATION so if it didn't involve me progressing in the navy then I kind of put on the back burner and %HESITATION I'm pretty sure I'll talk about a little bit later but %HESITATION I think as time is going on and get a little older of my priorities are kind of balancing out so where I want our home life as well as a an established career so %HESITATION hello I was privileged to have a conversation with a senior once and %HESITATION I just very recently and I would discuss retirement and he mentioned not being the only one at my retirement and that kinda hit home as saying like when you get older you don't want to %HESITATION focus so much on your career that you alienate your friends and family to where you're the only one standing there at your retirement 
,,jd_thomas,What does it take to really make a change in a team?,how to make a change in the team %HESITATION we're basically discussed and changing the culture %HESITATION so how do you change the culture %HESITATION our first say would be lead by example on the second thing would be being present so you can't change a culture about my by not being there so you have to be around the sailors you have to be around the person they are you have to be there when they're going through rough times you have to be there during the best time of the change that culture they're going to look at you as an example of what to do and what not to do in situations %HESITATION as time goes on and as as you progress in your your %HESITATION tours you start to notice that sailors will watch every everything that you do and what you say and eventually they'll come to you and ask you for %HESITATION advice %HESITATION Sir how do I do this Sir if you were in this situation what would you do and that's how you change culture it takes time but you lead by example and you stay present and you you'll eventually move that culture on being a more positive and productive %HESITATION environment 
,,jd_thomas,How has your view of this line of work changed over time?,%HESITATION my view of this line of work %HESITATION it's it hasn't changed that much %HESITATION again you just kinda go into each and every situation each and every two were %HESITATION looking to affected positively and the things that you learned and the things that %HESITATION or deals and experiences that you go through a you just take it on as a a learning experience %HESITATION something that you could add in your toolbox to help someone or some thing going for so %HESITATION my outlook on this career it's it's still the same %HESITATION still move headed out to save the world or help someone say to work and just to be in and incorporate a positive and productive working environment in whatever command a situation that I'm going to 
,,jd_thomas,What priorities would you recommend for a person entering this field?,are so %HESITATION of four person entering %HESITATION this feel our I'll give you three priorities %HESITATION the first and these are from one to three of it may sound counterintuitive %HESITATION or kind of backwards but we hear me out %HESITATION first priority will be self care %HESITATION you always have to take care of this so so physically mentally emotionally spiritually financially all five of those things %HESITATION ours you should take those into account %HESITATION when and in terms of these for hours %HESITATION number two will be your family and friends %HESITATION your family friends or allow you for support Seoul be there for them as best you can with the time that you have don't neglect of don't push them away if you have issues with them more problems of March each other do your best to work out those conflicts a move for your time on here on land with them is limited so you always have to be a C. ships will be at sea ships will operate so your time is limited so spend what time you have with your family and friends and you know joyous occasions are number three in terms of navy number three is navy of the navy as a third priority in my book simply because you can't take care of the navy if you don't first take care of yourself and to take care of your family if you don't take care of number one numbers one and two your focus will not be on the navy's mission so prioritize those three %HESITATION our front door I prioritize those three like that %HESITATION yeah 
,,jd_thomas,What skills do you wish you had mastered before entering your profession?,all this probably the biggest skill that I was so %HESITATION I needed to wash should have mastered before well least attempted to would be add me %HESITATION the navy in the military in general is very and man paperwork heavy so if you don't have a clear understanding of what what's required of you and how to %HESITATION %HESITATION man is that though the admin side of of being a leader %HESITATION you're definitely going to struggle so that's one skill I wish I would have mastered early on 
,,jd_thomas,What is one question you wished you asked earlier?,what's the one question I wish I would have asked earlier %HESITATION and it's also another question %HESITATION that I ask of a lot of seniors is how do you get how do I get better two and becoming the person I and envision myself being once our car so I think we all as human beings want to be the best husband wife father mother on all cool friend %HESITATION commanding officer master chief or whatever it may be you want to be the best that you want to be good at it you want to be looked at as being %HESITATION a a %HESITATION a leader in that field in terms of you know how people look up to you a role model in that field so that's one question that out I wish I would have asked myself early on even in childhood is how do I how do I improve how do I get better what things do I need to do to become a better person 
,,jd_thomas,"As a leader, how much more will I know about the overall goals of the work I am doing?",as you progress in your career %HESITATION you'll be privileged to more %HESITATION information and yes that's important in a sense but not in the sense that you may think of %HESITATION the key here will be too is how do you discern what to relay and what not to relate to your peers and to your family and to your sailors so you may be on to some very you know secret squirrel mission or whatever it may be wherever it may be and you'll have to understand what to say and what not to say to these people because you know let's face it we all work better when we know what we're what we when we know what we're doing and why we're doing so if I understand that Hey I'm doing I'm fixing this whatever piece of equipment it may be in order to %HESITATION I don't know accomplish some mission somewhere there now I work a little bit more at it now we're just a little bit more heart I'll be a little bit more attention to %HESITATION so you as a leader we have to find that balance of how to motivate how to keep your sailor's and your peers motivated but at the same time not given them up I love not given too much information to where it may be a %HESITATION %HESITATION issue going for 
,,jd_thomas,What was the most difficult part of your training?,are the most difficult part is all much rain will probably be being away from my friends and family %HESITATION I'm a very %HESITATION %HESITATION loving caring of family oriented person so %HESITATION there in a wreck my interaction with them %HESITATION daily weekly monthly however it may be %HESITATION plays a lot into %HESITATION my my psyche so %HESITATION not being able to communicate with them as often and %HESITATION as I'd like early on played a big part in it was very difficult for me to %HESITATION %HESITATION my operate throughout training or or conduct myself throughout training but %HESITATION it's a part of the job %HESITATION being in this career path you'll %HESITATION spend days weeks maybe even months without seeing your %HESITATION zero being able to converse with your family and friends so as time goes on you you you learn to manage and you learn to deal with it 
,,jd_thomas,How you can lead honorably?,%HESITATION leading all Arnold Lee is is %HESITATION not trick is not difficult at all %HESITATION again you lead by example you do what %HESITATION you think is right and %HESITATION my dad he's he's every time I see him %HESITATION when I leave home he says the same thing you know stay true to yourself and do what's right if you stay true to yourself and you do what's right and %HESITATION you communicate will is not not difficult all the lead on you'll never go wrong 
,,jd_thomas,How do you spend most of your time at work?,most of my time at work was spent %HESITATION basically mentor %HESITATION or doing paperwork %HESITATION again I kind of go by the %HESITATION the notion to lead by example %HESITATION and the way to %HESITATION impact a culture %HESITATION would be to staff people seeing you doing what you request of them and if they see you working there more inclined to work they see you doing the right thing they're more inclined to do the right thing so that's how I spent most of my time at work 
,,jd_thomas,What was your first major leadership role?,my first major leadership role in the navy would be the %HESITATION repair officer %HESITATION role as in this is on the USS Lhasa %HESITATION but also I cook I compared it to be in a Big Brother on and a role model throughout my community 
,,jd_thomas,Describe the work you did on a typical day.,so on a typical day on the USS Lassen as repair officer of my day typically started %HESITATION very early %HESITATION anywhere from four to five AM dependent on the watch schedule an opinion on if we were in port or at sea %HESITATION out just kind of in a blend in a couple things %HESITATION the main thing was to be visit be present and to to know before your bosses know and %HESITATION always give out clear communication so in order to do that you have to be up early %HESITATION and make around so I would get up early %HESITATION get ready you know which includes like you know you shower and everything and then you get you get up and you what you make your rounds walkie spaces make sure that your sailor see you out there early in the morning off and head up to the court today to see if there are any issues of within my personnel or something that I need to be notified of %HESITATION after that you know grab a quick breakfast %HESITATION and just go see the vision walk around the four quarters %HESITATION meet them at quarters and it you know just kind of a %HESITATION plan out your day from there %HESITATION that kind of goes around your why schedule your training schedule and your study in schedule because you're always qualify you always trying to qualify for something so you have to fit those three things and whites division training whites division training and that that this that was basically my day everyday 
,,jd_thomas,Describe the physical environments in which you've worked.,the physical environment where I worked %HESITATION it very %HESITATION may do so typically has a a first tour %HESITATION you're standing bridge watch or %HESITATION combat watch so bridge watch depending on where you are located in the world it could be colder than me hot it would be warm it could be humid %HESITATION but it was very rewarding because you can you know you're always you know privileged to have the sunshine or did the elements out of combat watch is always cold %HESITATION they have to keep the equipment coal so %HESITATION going from the bridge down to combat is like walking from say a sauna to a freezer and %HESITATION sin in the freezer often %HESITATION during training your %HESITATION typically walking through the main spaces and the main spaces can reach upwards of a hundred degrees on average because of all the machinery and all the fluids and all the heat that's generated %HESITATION so it it just varies in Japan so you have to kinda be ready for you know everything 
,,jd_thomas,How many hours do you work in a typical week?,%HESITATION for typical week out probably say about maybe eighty if you were deployed it's probably about seventy eighty %HESITATION import I say about maybe fifty fifty five on average your typical day import you're probably working %HESITATION I'd say about twelve hours a day %HESITATION at sea I bought that up anywhere from twelve to eighteen hours a day 
,,jd_thomas,What kinds of decisions do you make in your career on a daily basis?,so %HESITATION as far as decisions you're you're making split decisions like every two or three minutes there's always something %HESITATION with the division that I had which was %HESITATION like I said about twenty six or twenty seven people everyone has a personality everyone has an issue everyone has something going all and not to include the ship schedule where there's training where there's evolutions where there's always something happens and then not to mention you have to stay and watch you have to get your training and your qualifications and so that doesn't include communicating with your boss is your supervisors which are you know your second torture department he is maybe even that so so %HESITATION you're making decisions on where to go next to to talk to next what to do next and I email this person that I call this person that I talk to this person have I done this have I done that so %HESITATION there's a split decision is made like every I don't know thirty seconds or so who 
,,jd_thomas,What kinds of problems do you deal with?,as far as problems %HESITATION you deal with just about anything that you can think of %HESITATION mainly personnel issues or admin issues I think those are like the the big ones %HESITATION the third would probably be material with somebody's things break and you have to establish like %HESITATION a priority and and which what problems get fixed first and who do you have to fix what problems %HESITATION manning issues we need these three people to go here but we have this evolution going on over here this is %HESITATION your problems can range from I was a personal and with say up %HESITATION of sailors family member you know hasn't having some issues and you have to literally like you know stop what you don't want to make sure that they're all focused to do the job that they're supposed to do as opposed to focus in on what's going on back home so you have to be well well rounded and well versed in very patient when it comes to dealing with a multitude of problems %HESITATION I always tell people to the the the the I have a storm basically you know stay call thank things through and do not really react how you feel the most of the time 
,,jd_thomas,What is a story that really shows what it is like working in your job?,okay %HESITATION I give you a great example of what was what was a typical day %HESITATION I would like to say we we were pulling into may be tomorrow on deployment and we needed this %HESITATION Michael this part that it weighed about two hundred pounds two we had to get it from off the ship which was on the pier to the folks of the front of the ship all the way to the bottom of the ship in order to have an install but this part with about two hundred pounds so %HESITATION I had just come off why us and we were rounded up you know everyone to see if we can get this thing down there and %HESITATION it took us about fifteen twenty minutes to round up everyone because you people are scattered throughout the ship so once we got everybody rounded up %HESITATION we located a %HESITATION like a shaft that led all the way to the bottom of the ship from the folks so the idea was to have a crane low the %HESITATION part on to this the fo'c'sle and you know lower downforce easy day well wow the crane was sweet like bringing the the part on board the %HESITATION shaft on the crane broke so they had to set the crane down so he well it ended up on the folks but we still have to get to the bottom of the ship this thing wait about two hundred pounds and their weight so we were %HESITATION actually you know being rushed and %HESITATION you know the captain just kind of walk through and just kinda notice like what was going on so he ended up giving me the look like you know what you're going to now right so %HESITATION we had everybody here so we grabbed a boatswain's mate and asked in a tie a few not and we %HESITATION tied up to par and it took probably about ten of us and we Horsted it down but I think it was about maybe like seven flight so %HESITATION of stairs or something to light lowered down to the bottom of this year and %HESITATION after that we ended up going to another evolution because we were in a report so we had to %HESITATION get all the how the %HESITATION hospital services hooked up in you know your your water and fresh water your gray water not a kind of stuff it was %HESITATION I was just like a typical day you know 
,,jd_thomas,What are the major benefits of doing this kind of work?,other major benefits %HESITATION of doing something like this would be %HESITATION experience and %HESITATION knowledge and also being able to you know they teach you to be resources full but at the same time it also teaches you to deal with a lot of stress and if you can handle stress you can handle almost anything 
,,jd_thomas,What are the major negatives of doing this kind of work?,all the major negatives to doing this kind of work would be stress %HESITATION you deal with a lot day in and day out %HESITATION and sometimes it it may feel as if as if it's too much to handle %HESITATION you don't sleep much %HESITATION you're always on the go so you kind of your mind is almost %HESITATION re taught and how it operates so you're you spent a lot of time like even rest in trying to slow your mind down and lie operate at a normal level so it's kind of tough to decompress at times when operating and working on over under a an environment like that 
,,jd_thomas,How much travel do you do in a year?,on a typical year of travel basically depends on whether you're all sea duty %HESITATION shore duty %HESITATION my shore duty pharmacy duty %HESITATION I would say I was going probably nine months out of twelve %HESITATION with will in three patrols which for about three months each and the one mall that we would have in port was spent %HESITATION preparing to go back out to sea %HESITATION so you definitely traveled a lot %HESITATION I went to probably maybe seven or eight different countries %HESITATION we went to a lot of different ports %HESITATION it was definitely a fun experience it was an awesome experience %HESITATION stressful a lot of work but you know we went to places like Korea South Korea %HESITATION Malaysia %HESITATION don't forget a couple names %HESITATION you don't want to %HESITATION places few places in south of France %HESITATION afterwards %HESITATION we %HESITATION travel to Hawaii San Diego Mexico %HESITATION stop in a few places to re fuel %HESITATION even went to a small island called %HESITATION site pain which was also 
,,jd_thomas,Why do you love your job?,%HESITATION was not to love about my job %HESITATION I think %HESITATION the big three things that come to mind would be the experience and guidance that you offer that you're able to offer a fellow sailors and that would be you know subordinates peers and sometimes even seniors you know %HESITATION outside of that the travel %HESITATION I've been and been to places and I've seen things that you know my parents will never see have never seen %HESITATION I think it's helped me grow as a person tremendously %HESITATION another thing would probably be the the the benefits that come with being a you know servicemen the %HESITATION the pay not to mention %HESITATION the %HESITATION career development but also the opportunities that you know come with you know being a a and a sailor which would be you know the networking opportunities been able to you know have friends all over the world you know family all of the world 
,,jd_thomas,What gets romanticized about your career field that really isn't that great?,so %HESITATION one thing has remained says about been officer is %HESITATION actually the right %HESITATION a lot of sailors are you when you're in a tough decisions or say you're in a vision or department you have like a those are huge inspection coming up for you know and %HESITATION their use your division I departments have some issues the common thing that you'll hear a lot is Hey that's why you get paid the big Bucks you know so it's %HESITATION they're very romanticized to you know where the right but there's a lot of responsibilities that come with the right so I think that's probably the main thing 
,,jd_thomas,What are some of the common misconceptions about your field?,I think %HESITATION one main misconception is that your that you operate with a sort of privilege and that you're like born into a life this opportunity that you just different it's your special %HESITATION I think that's the big thing %HESITATION I like to believe and I really do feel this way that I'm just like you are just like anyone else who %HESITATION server with this yes I had a different opportunity someone told me about a program that this person did know about someone gave me the opportunity to have this chance to you know %HESITATION service serve our country that someone else didn't know about so I think that's the big thing is that your your soul special and that you're different your like your cut from like a different cloth or something like that but %HESITATION how big a difference 
,,jd_thomas,What do you do now that is different from what you thought you would be doing?,%HESITATION I don't think there is anything different %HESITATION I've always approached been a leader by being humble Bobby is almost like we have been a follower furs if you can follow you can leave so if you leave with empathy and you understand how it how it feels or what it's like to follow someone then there's really no difference 
,,jd_thomas,How did your work day change over your career?,over my career my word a change based on the demands of the command in on the %HESITATION the %HESITATION the commanding officer so that's typically how your workday will change so how you operate an approach your work day prior to deployment will be totally different than how you operate and approach a work day after deployment the same can be said for %HESITATION dealing with inspection prior to an inspection say in in Sir %HESITATION you can expect that your command will have six maybe the seven day work weeks but you pass that inspection of that in Sir and you can expect that your work they'll be totally different 
,,jd_thomas,"Where did you have to move in your career, and how did that change things each time?",sold %HESITATION I would say that my career is kind of a unique %HESITATION over the past eight years I think I've moved may be four five times %HESITATION and that's I think that's a unique situation %HESITATION prior to being %HESITATION commission officer I was listed as a %HESITATION under is made airman %HESITATION for two years in Jacksonville %HESITATION after our democracy or after applying OCS I'll was you know give an opportunity to earn my commission which meant I had to move to Rhode Island %HESITATION I was a %HESITATION are my commission as a naval flight officers so I left Rhode Island and went to Pensacola %HESITATION I was down in Pensacola for about eight months in which %HESITATION you know was a try to from flight school %HESITATION for a number of issues I left when the San Diego for trying to thousand San Diego six months so after being a San Diego for six months of me every doesn't it as a slow I live for Japan for twenty months sounds very twenty months and then my tour in it and then I ended up back in Jacksonville as a %HESITATION serves warfare office on %HESITATION does Ross there and I was there for two years after been in Jacksonville for two years %HESITATION left and now I'm here in California so %HESITATION the roles were a lot different the %HESITATION demands were a lot different %HESITATION but if you approach it your daily almost today almost the same it depends on the demands that are set upon the command and what the commanding officer expects out of his staff and his ship so a lot of times the %HESITATION commanding officer kind of dictates how %HESITATION a persons or a a his sailors days ago his or her sailors daily goals 
,,jd_thomas,Where do you see yourself in 5 years? 10?,in five years I see myself %HESITATION finishing my %HESITATION either my second tour department here Ryan or my early command ride going back shortly so I'll be probably headed to the Pentagon to work on a %HESITATION staff %HESITATION utilizing my masters in business administration and finance management from the name postgraduate school %HESITATION ten years %HESITATION I expect to be %HESITATION finishing my it's socio tore on board a %HESITATION probably the DDG or maybe a new free

,,jd_thomas,What are the most important decisions that you face daily as a leader in your organization?,as a leader in my organization %HESITATION one important decision I face every day is %HESITATION to decide to get up and go to work every day %HESITATION and I think we we all are faced with that %HESITATION may be you know everyone has their bad days and you know sometimes you just you don't feel like doing you don't feel like you know but what makes the decision for me is the fact that there's a team of sailors all peers and even seniors that are somewhere so you know relying on me to you know help get them through the day %HESITATION I always like to believe that maybe there there's a sailor who's going through something and me not showing up at work that day could be the day that they feel like a temporary problem is a permanent problem and that's what importance is in %HESITATION make every day 
,,jd_thomas,What do you need to know about yourself to lead a team?,there's a few things that I feel that a person should know about or sales %HESITATION prior to lead a team or even Willie today and asked one is to know who they are %HESITATION to to know where they're from and three %HESITATION how to improvise %HESITATION the first one of knowing who you are %HESITATION those sailors a smart people %HESITATION I would pick up on a lot of things we observe a watch a lot so if you're if you doubt yourself in your shoes sure about yourself as a person and that makes me believe that you are fit to lead me into any situation %HESITATION to know where you're from I like to believe that a a person's family and their friends and their background pays a lot of big part into their leadership and who they are as a person so %HESITATION I like to think that I conduct myself in a manner that my grandmother or my mother or my dad or my my grandfather would approve of if you saw me interacting with and leading a team %HESITATION been able to empathize I think there's just a part of a %HESITATION you know just daily living of in %HESITATION interacting with each other

,,jd_thomas,What are the most important factors about a situation to consider?,%HESITATION most four factors are about a situation I would say would be the %HESITATION who what when where how and why %HESITATION understanding %HESITATION the background of the situation and who's involved what's involved was the issue of how to come about %HESITATION will help you on the road to a solution and how to fix it

,,jd_thomas,How long does it take to complete your training for OOD (officer of the deck) underway?,to complete %HESITATION the under way training on that depends largely on %HESITATION the the ship schedule in the at sea time that you're you're able to you know to get as a junior officer %HESITATION it can take anywhere from you know six to twelve months but that depends largely on your work ethic %HESITATION you opportunities for training and the ship schedule %HESITATION but the idea going into this is to for you to be hungry and that is to %HESITATION take advantage of every training opportunity that that you're given 
,,jd_thomas,What advice do you have for someone trying to complete training like OOD underway?,%HESITATION for anyone inspired to complete %HESITATION the underway training %HESITATION what first say that it depends heavily on your work at and your time management skills %HESITATION the second thing work together there are multiple personnel on board that will be striving for the same qualifications and contrary to popular believe this is not a competition %HESITATION work together %HESITATION there's a famous saying teamwork makes the dream work %HESITATION for you to study together trying together work together it will allow you to be more of a competent watched and their %HESITATION instead of always thinking and looking over your shoulder worried about what this person may have what that person may have so work together and use your time wisely 
,,jd_thomas,What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?,arm I have a face the numbers shown just throughout my career %HESITATION the first challenge was to balance %HESITATION family and home life with the your new career that's a challenge in itself %HESITATION the neighbors very demanding and I like to laugh and joke you know you know with my girlfriend and say Hey you know you're the mistress going into this situation and the navy's my wife so you know you have to give in where you fit in but that's it's somewhat that somewhere that's true %HESITATION so you as the %HESITATION service member you have to find that work life balance on the second challenge %HESITATION I'm going through some challenges throughout you know some of my training %HESITATION I was a flight school to try so I went to %HESITATION was commission as a naval flight officers students %HESITATION initially so that was the the probably the biggest challenge that I faced throughout my career %HESITATION one word of one piece of advice I can say to anyone going through a similar challenge would be to look at every opportunity as a %HESITATION learn a lesson and think of the positives always have a positive attitude and always having a can do attitude no matter what so those were %HESITATION probably the two biggest challenges I face so far 
,,jd_thomas,What is the most challenging part about your job? ,the most challenging part about my job would happen it would probably be the interacting and working with the different personalities different backgrounds and the different cultures of may sound funny at first but %HESITATION when you're you've got three for three to four hundred people on on this you know five hundred and ten foot you know ship %HESITATION for months on end it's kind of difficult to you know continue those working relationships when you live eat and sleep with these other as in sleep next to each other

,,jd_thomas,Do you have any kids?,no I do not have any kids 
,,jd_thomas,Do you have siblings?,yes I have two brothers %HESITATION an older brother named Marcus who's a supply officer in the navy and I have a younger brother by the name of Michael who's a field engineer at a nuclear plant 
,,jd_thomas,Do you have any pets?,no I do not have any pets but I do love dogs and I wanted to go but the %HESITATION %HESITATION demands of of being a slow %HESITATION con out way my my %HESITATION morally of believe saw and what it means to have a pet %HESITATION I'm not a fan of putting pets in kennels and have been locked up in a house or an apartment so I'm not in a stable situation where I can %HESITATION allow my dog to you know like roam free and I can spend you know ample time with 
,,jd_thomas,Do you have a significant other?,%HESITATION up started dating %HESITATION currently like trying to I guess you know iron out the details with someone and %HESITATION narrowing down but she doesn't live here so that kinda %HESITATION play puts a wrinkle in things %HESITATION especially with the time you know being on shore duty you wanna spend as much time as you can with %HESITATION the one that you care about %HESITATION but we're currently doing trying the long distance thing %HESITATION shoes she lives back home in the south and %HESITATION that so %HESITATION it's kind of a tough thing because you only you know you get to see our every now and then and yet they have to devote time to talk to or you know throughout the day but you know being three hours behind it plays %HESITATION %HESITATION and I put another wrinkle into the situation so it it's it's kind of tough but you know it's working 
,,jd_thomas,How much free time do you have in your career?,free time what is that %HESITATION but %HESITATION it depends on you know the your ship schedule your command schedule as well as you know if your own sure do UFC duty %HESITATION right now I'm on shore duty student status here in PS %HESITATION but my work load is very happy %HESITATION this quarter have %HESITATION eighteen hours of credits and %HESITATION which kind of question about five classes %HESITATION so here time management plays %HESITATION probably like the most important %HESITATION role in everything %HESITATION I do my best to not study on a weekend say Saturday and Sunday which means that Monday through Friday %HESITATION twelve to fourteen hours and class or in the library in a study of so that I can have the Saturday and Sunday as 
,,jd_thomas,How often do you take work home with you?,I do my best to never take my work home with me %HESITATION %HESITATION I don't study at home %HESITATION I don't I do my best to never ever ever ever ever take your work home %HESITATION when you start to bridge that gap between home and work that's where you lose focus %HESITATION and you lose that balance of home life work life because now you're at home working about worrying about work and then you'll go to work and you're worried about home so %HESITATION by not taking my work home I learned that's like a %HESITATION separation %HESITATION online in a saying that I don't cross what do my best not to 
,,jd_thomas,Does being a leader give you flexiblity to alter your work schedule?,in some ways yes and in some ways no %HESITATION just a two bit you're always serve us subordinate to someone you always have a boss so %HESITATION in a as you know the past two commands of course I work for a commander and a captain so %HESITATION your schedule was dictated by the captain scheduled to come to a schedule so if you wanted your work before he got to work and you had all to your schedule if you didn't mind you going home after work was done say at two thirty three o'clock %HESITATION that alters your schedule so %HESITATION you cannot you're at the mercy of the soul you're at the mercy of demands that are placed upon you by %HESITATION by the command and by the %HESITATION the schedule 
,,jd_thomas,"How does being a leader change your lifestyle? (frequent travel, irregular hours, family difficulties etc.)",%HESITATION I don't think of my last oil change much I always felt like I was always a leader so the things that I'm I firmly believe that how you are at home that's how you are at work or it's it's true for me how I interact with personnel seniors of subordinates at work is how are I am at home so I'm very personable %HESITATION very respectful very empathetic so I'll treat you just like our teacher at home so nothing really changes for 
,,jd_thomas,How do your command responsibilities affect your style in personal life?,not that I think it have been affected tremendously %HESITATION on one side of the corn %HESITATION your you have the chance of impacting the command with who you are and how you are as a person %HESITATION and on the other side of that that command will impact you in almost the same manner so you have to consciously %HESITATION make an effort to incorporate the positive things but resist the negative things and at the same time do %HESITATION do the same with yourself you know as far as what you bring excuse me to that command so %HESITATION I think the impact is mutual you know but %HESITATION I were I was actually %HESITATION I remember talking to a %HESITATION god I was in college it was about a fraternity and I'll fill a negative way about the surge attorney and %HESITATION he basically looked at me and said Hey you know you have to bill the fraternity around you you know don't build yourself around the paternity and I think that may be you know all the difference in the world 
,,jd_thomas,What is a good approach for selecting a new duty station in terms of finding an area for my family to live in?,%HESITATION the biggest and best approach I can say is %HESITATION you have that conversation with your spouse and your family early and often %HESITATION that no one knows the needs of you and your family better than you and your family so %HESITATION when you're searching for a duty station you know you try to find that balance of what the navy needs and what the navy wants and what you want and what your family wants for you as far as how to you know progress towards the future so once you develop those four five things that are important to you go out and you find a duty station and an area within a duty station that you know me Stolz demands and you you basically you know express how you feel and what you want it's simple %HESITATION and what you have to be open to %HESITATION other or secondary and tertiary options also 
,,jd_thomas,What are the things I should prioritize when picking housing?,I think that's a question that I should ask you where things are more important you when picking houses %HESITATION my personal thing is %HESITATION %HESITATION when it comes to me I like my own space I like comfort ally garages because I like cars I like to build cars and %HESITATION I like suburbs so those things make me you know happy %HESITATION ideally what you're doing is what you're looking for houses as a service member you're you're trying to %HESITATION eight a positive and productive work of positive and productive home life for you to go back to what you had a stressful day at work so if you have a long hard day at work you know trying to think of the things that you want to have around you when you go home so that could be of %HESITATION open concept single story ranch house with %HESITATION recessed lighting or it could be a one bedroom studio whatever makes you comfortable that you're willing to go home and turn the phones off turn the TV is off it just be happy being home so think about those things were you looking for housing of course you have to find you know someplace that's within your budget 
,,jd_thomas,What options do you have to transfer or change if you or your family needs it?,now that depends on the situation %HESITATION if it's something set family emergency or a %HESITATION you know you know knock on wood %HESITATION a family member you know if I was out there or or an immediate family member found out that there you know save you know cancer stricken or something %HESITATION %HESITATION my personal belief is that you express that that needed that issue early and often with your chain of command and that's the %HESITATION to ensure that the %HESITATION commanding officer understands the severity of of the event %HESITATION %HESITATION this Holly depends on also the command schedule and the demands placed upon it command and your role within those %HESITATION those operations so %HESITATION expressed that needed to issue early and often and %HESITATION explore those options with the command %HESITATION I have not seen or experienced one of %HESITATION command try it that does not do their best to %HESITATION work with the service member to ensure that they have time or the ask you to go home and you know be with the family member do what do you know provide as much support as they came %HESITATION on the other hand in situations where say a spouse has the opportunity of a lifetime to %HESITATION take you know advantage of a a %HESITATION a job opportunity %HESITATION I hate to say it but that your spouse is your mistress and and reality and the navy is your your your husband or your wife at the time you know so you it'll probably be best for you and your wife your with your spouse to work that that situation %HESITATION they may have to %HESITATION you may have to DO bass while they move %HESITATION she may he or she may not be able to take that position it's just something that you have to work out with with your signature significant other 
,,jd_thomas,"How will my relationship with my friends or family members be affected if I take a difficult assignment, and what advice should I give them?",are these your your relationships with your significant other your friends or family be will be affected tremendously %HESITATION you %HESITATION there's there may be some information you may not be able to relate to them and in terms of its severity and %HESITATION what you'll be doing but %HESITATION he he you it is your responsibility to communicate to them that you know %HESITATION that you are on a difficult assignment and that you may %HESITATION require a more support than normal and more patience than normal and %HESITATION that I would use that as a perfect time to take advantage of %HESITATION express in your your need for them as your support system so %HESITATION but is in all in all you'll need them more than their needs 
,,jd_thomas,How early should I get my family involved in the process of planning my next career step?,early as possible home as soon as you are up for a slate or use %HESITATION I would say as soon as you get to your first duty station so as soon as you get there you should always be thinking about what you want to go there %HESITATION we want to do next what what bought what bill it's what options that that may be available for you to do next %HESITATION and how it relates to and how it revolves around what you want to accomplish with your family %HESITATION give you an example for example myself %HESITATION I like to be married in a couple years %HESITATION I'm pursuing a department head and one day be a CEO %HESITATION I would like to go back to Jacksonville that's where I have a rental property my family's from Georgia %HESITATION in say everything goes as planned and I get married have kids I would like my key is to know my parents %HESITATION but in the event that I'm shipped off to say San Diego or nor full or Hawaii or Japan or Spain at just makes it the situation a little bit more you know difficult to deal with so coming up with %HESITATION secondary and tertiary options early and often you know I can better prepare myself and my family and my situation going for 
,,jd_thomas,What has been your favorite place to live? Why?,wow that's a tough one %HESITATION my favorite this own to to size I would say my favorite place to live or favorite places to live we'll probably be you because because a pair and Jacksonville Florida %HESITATION I say you cruise go because it was a total culture shock and it was just an awesome place to to live you know you see the different cultures %HESITATION you see how they their customs how that through the traditions that they live by and and just the ease of of of being a foreigner and living in a different country was just an amazing experience %HESITATION also living in Jacksonville you know I'm a %HESITATION born and raised Georgia boys so %HESITATION been ejected rules like been in south Georgia so %HESITATION I'm the biggest Georgia Bulldogs fan there is so %HESITATION of course got to go to the Georgia Florida games %HESITATION the cocktail party %HESITATION and it was just also be around family and friends while also being able to go to work and you know serve the country 
,,jd_thomas,What is an example of a conflict you had between your career and family life? How did you learn from it?,an example of a conflict between my career and family life %HESITATION %HESITATION probably the %HESITATION I'll I was actually %HESITATION involved in a %HESITATION %HESITATION heavy relationship and want to and %HESITATION the relationship didn't work out simply because you know I had earned my commission and the %HESITATION mob significant other at a time of a %HESITATION you five so %HESITATION rather than %HESITATION get married on navy the navy's circumstances %HESITATION I chose to do you know put it off and %HESITATION that was probably the biggest %HESITATION conflict between the military in my personal life 
,,jd_thomas,How do you manage both career and family effectively?,%HESITATION this comic con to go back to the whole analogy of kind of like to close is allocated to the boat again %HESITATION you you definitely empathize with your family %HESITATION and you understand who you are to them and what you mean to them and your responsibilities and how you want to %HESITATION proceed going for with your family %HESITATION but at the same time you have you know career obligations so that's probably like the biggest balancing job that you ever do as a person you know is difficult is not easy %HESITATION one thing to our will definitely you know say if you don't if you if you don't remember anything up see just remember that you're the neighbor will always be there after you're gone long after you're gone they will be here but when you decide to retire who will be there to support you when you get out and they a something for you to definitely think about you don't want to stand there by yourself or give your flag to or give me your %HESITATION your certificates in your flags to like your mom or something like that you know so keep that in mind when you're about us and home life and work 
,,jd_thomas,What should I get ready to live overseas?,our view there are an event that you're given an opportunity to live overseas I would say %HESITATION short answer everything get everything ready %HESITATION I'm not sure %HESITATION what you'll what that encompasses for you %HESITATION for me it was a total total life changer %HESITATION %HESITATION a lot of people don't bring their cars over there so you need to have to decide to sell your car or you know leave it was someone so that they can maintain it %HESITATION some people have properties %HESITATION so you have to decide whether to sell that property or put it up for rent which means you have to find a property manager or find someone to help take care of it your phone changes because your own totally different networks than you are they did from being over here in the US as opposed to being in Spain or Japan %HESITATION everything everything's going to change %HESITATION but that's something that you know you sit down with %HESITATION your command leadership and you you you dig into these things and say Hey you know try to answer the questions before their **** even family wise %HESITATION what were the living options for a spouse for your spouse and for your children %HESITATION into paying or your cruise girl you know at least %HESITATION mmhm sailors with dependence that were required to live on on base so you know a lot of people you know had their children in school and their families lived in on base with %HESITATION so those are things that you have to ask the yourself ask a question before forget says and sometimes unfortunately things fall between the cracks because no one thought about it but it's up to you as the service member to do that 
,,jd_thomas,What resources should I look for when I know I am moving to a location?,so you're moving to a new location or say a new command first thing you should do is reach out to your sponsor %HESITATION %HESITATION typically %HESITATION commands will sign a sponsor to you because you're a new addition to the command and that person will be you know similar in rain age or you know something similar to what you have and what you are excuse me so %HESITATION reach out to that sponsor if you haven't %HESITATION got a sponsor %HESITATION reach out to the command nine and I'm set a time each command has a website %HESITATION to get in touch with and that command typically %HESITATION probably you know for five months or maybe even further out maybe about a year %HESITATION before your due to arrive they'll send out a welcome aboard package which includes names of sponsor name phone numbers command information email addresses and things of that nature %HESITATION it will also allow you to get in touch with say the %HESITATION command all but some in which is typically a navy %HESITATION a spouse of someone in the command who's in charge of helping your family get acclimated to the new area and you'll reach out through your sponsor and through that welcome aboard package you'll be able to find schools %HESITATION living areas %HESITATION housing opportunities %HESITATION religious %HESITATION services %HESITATION just about any and everything that you made the that those parts they'll be able to help you out %HESITATION another resource would be the command CMC %HESITATION or the sea of sea I which is the command Massachusetts so he or she %HESITATION will always have a plethora of resources to help you get acclimated to the new command and the new area
