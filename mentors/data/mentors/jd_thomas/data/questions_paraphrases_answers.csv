I love writing love, math and science and just enjoyed learning as I got older. Uh, the more I got into sports and the more I got into girls unless I focused on school. School came kind of easy to me in high school, so I can't remember too often like taking home a book because it came so natural to me. You know, I think my parents that helped me develop that foundation of, like being a quick learner and high school. I didn't have to study so much. College was kind of the same. I kind of felt, you know, fell in hard with the women and sports and less on studies. So I really didn't focus my year college until my senior year, which I was challenged by my mother. So outside of that, up until now, you know, it's kind of it's kind of taken a turn to be more focused as a student toe. Apply the things that I learned in school, so that's kind of how I would describe myself as a student"

You know, we had some deaths in the family that caused, like, a huge ripple effect throughout, but at the same time, we were family. So, you know, we're stuck together and just kind of rode the wave out. But my childhood was awesome. My adolescence period was awesome. My adult life was awesome. Every trial and tribulation that you go through, you just kind of look at it as a learning experience and how to get better. Better. So I have nothing but great memories and, you know, positive things to say about the people that I grew up around and the people that, you know, I had the experience."

,,jd_thomas,What position did you play in football?,"football. So during my playing time as a football player, I was a linebacker, defensive in pulling guard and a fullback also play special teams. We had a small, um, high school, and so you never came off to feel if you had any form of athleticism. College jobs. Actually, I have to make the practice squad for a semester at Georgia Southern, where I was aspiring to be a defensive end."
,,jd_thomas,Were you a football captain?,Yes. My senior of high school served at the team's captain.
,,jd_thomas,How do you track all your tasks?,"simple, simple way to track your tasks are thio. Maintain a planner, find a pocket planner and basically write down all your tasks and organize them. Keep them organized. You're going to write, I would say, Write down every task that you have, no matter how minuscule, matter how great, and transfer it over from day to day, and that will allow you to keep track of all your task."
,,jd_thomas,How do you decompress/slow down?,"all right. I've done number ways for you to decompress and actually slow down. Um, let's go with first by being at home. Home port? Well, being important. So you're on a ship and you're important. One way to decompress would be on the right home and a right to work. Used that quiet time to gather your thoughts, to focus your thoughts, to shift gears from being full throttle at work, to going home to re prioritizing things by being with your family. So keep this in mind. Never take your work home, Leave work at work. And so when you walk outside of that, uh, offer the quarterdeck, take your hard hat off, take cover off figuratively and leave it at work. So you go home, Go be with your family on that ride home. Decompress. Get those thoughts out. Think about things that you that don't involve work. And then when you get home, focus on your family while you're deployed, say, on the ship for a time period, you decompress by working out by doing and being actively engaged in certain hobbies that you might you might be involved in. I think about things like maybe playing video games, reading magazines, reading a book. There's, ah, brief period before you say you're about to go hit the rack for the night. Take about 20 minutes. Thio. You know, pray, read a book, watch a movie, watch video, watch something to help decompress prior to going to sleep."
,,jd_thomas,Why didn't flight school work out?,"for me Flight school, it it could be looked at as a touch of situation. But for me, it's, Ah, a learning experience. Flight school didn't work out for me. For a multitude of reasons. I'm a very spiritual person. So when you when you attend a strenuous training environment such as flight school, you have to be 110% focused on achieving that goal. Um, I wasn't able to do that. So down there I was focused on a multitude of different things. That flight school kind of took a back seat. And by the time that it did take a front row seat, it was too late. I was unable to, uh, recover, and fortunately, I was able to regroup and move on to something else. Um, I think as in general as servicemen, you know, sailors and military, uh, people. I guess you could say we all have this this inner thoughts about this inner thought or this interview of ourselves as if we can accomplish any and everything but the reality, you know, we fail. Sometimes, Sometimes things just don't work out, and you have to develop that that outlook that sometimes things just don't go your way, and sometimes you fail. But the key here is when you fail, can you move on with a better outlook on what happened? You always have to look at a situation as a learning experience as some some look at something some in some way, shape or form as how do I improve off of this situation? And that's what I had to do. And that's what you'll be asked to do when whatever situation you're in doesn't go as planned, it's temporary and that you can move on and be, you know, be a better person at whatever it may be. You just hit a bump in the road and you can move forward."
,,jd_thomas,How do you set the tone as a leader? What is the right tone?,"So in order to set the tone and to find that right tone, I think it's one in the same. You lead by example, um, and you leave with empathy. So if you're gonna understand how someone feels understand how it feels to be laid into a situation, you can better leave someone into a situation so lead by example and leading with company empathy will set the tone for just about any situation."
,,jd_thomas,"What are the most common mistakes you've seen new leaders make? (e.g., skipping steps)","common mistakes. I see new leaders make our I'm not listening and not observing. My mom would always say and she still says to this day, you listen, you have to our two years, two eyes and one mile, four reason. So listen and observe more than you speak on. I think new leaders doom or talking and less listening than than anything. And that's, ah, big mistake. Also, one more thing is that they so come to outside pressures, and by about falling into those pressures, they tend to rush themselves and skip steps, and that causes issues among team members and say throughout a command. So, um"
,,jd_thomas,"What problems need to be rooted out early, or you'll have trouble fixing them later?","some problems that should be definitely rooted out would be ego. You're not bigger than the team. You're not bigger than the Navy. You're not more important. But you definitely have to root out your ego going into a situation being a leader in high school, I played football, so we had a LA logo or model. I'm sorry that I always say a big team Little me is The team is bigger than me. So take care ego out of that situation and, uh, everything well, kind of kind of flow."
,,jd_thomas,How much leadership should you take charge of versus letting your senior petty officer lead?,"so to answer that question, I think it depends. It depends on the situation. It depends on what needs to take place out of the leader in that role. And also it depends on your experience and your knowledge of the situation, as well as the leaders of the senior petty officers, knowledge and experience in that situation. To bridge that gap and to move forward, you have to communicate early and often, and between yourself and that senior petty officer to kind of develop a understanding off of how he or she operates in a situation how you operate in a situation. It becomes like a marriage relationship between YouTube. Kind of like, you know, shack in Kobe. You know, Jordan and Pippen. You know, you work well together, you learn each other, and you kind of know when and where he or she will be and what they'll say and what needs to be said. And vice versa. Fire yourself"
,,jd_thomas,How do I balance being close with my team versus fraternizing?,"you find that balance? Uh, with your team, you know, it's a It's a tricky situation is kind of tough because the people that should be leading and you'll be working with our will be around the same age. For example, when I was ah E three as an undesignated see me? I was 24 years old and my lieutenant division officer was 24 years old, so we shared a lot of of the similar interests. Sara, A lot of you know, common things amongst ourselves. But how do you find that that balances you? You just keep in mind that you're a lieutenant or you're an incident and he or she is a seaman Airman, First class, third class, second class. One more tidbit. Just keep in mind that you get paid on the 15 1st on the 15th of every month, and you don't want to jeopardize you know, your priorities at home for making a mistake out in the fleet"
,,jd_thomas,What are the main things that a new leader must learn and adjust to?,"the first thing a leader must adjust who would be stress? This job and this career path is very stressful. So you will have to learn how to operate and live with stress. Constant nonstop stress. How do you do that? Um, you prioritize certain things and you learn new techniques. So one of those things would be time management. You have to learn how to balance your time between certain activities at work, certain stresses at work, certain things that work and learn when to shut him on and off, you know, accordingly. Um, also finding a time too, Uh, focus on yourself, which are mental and physical hill in your home life. So those things will help help a leader, balance and stress and time management."
,,jd_thomas,How have your priorities changed as your career progresses?,"As my career progresses, I think I've found more balance. Early on, I was all career based career focused on, so if it didn't involve me progressing in the Navy, then I kind of put it on the back burner and I'm pretty sure I'll talk about a little bit later. But, um, I think as time is going on and I'm getting a little older, my priorities are kind of balancing out where I want Ah, home life as well as a an established career. So I was privileged to have a conversation with a senior once, and this is very recently and I would discuss retirement. And he mentioned not being the only one at my retirement and that kind of hit home as saying, like when you get older, you don't wanna focus so much on your career that you alien nature of friends and family to where you're the only one standing there at your retirement"
,,jd_thomas,What does it take to really make a change in a team?,"to make a change in the team were basically discussed and changing the culture s. So how do you change that culture? I would first say would be leading by example. The second thing would be be in prison So you can't change the culture by my not being there. So you have to be around the sailors. You have to be around the personnel. You have to be there when they're going through rough times. You have to be there during the best times. Change that culture. They're gonna look at you as an example of what to do and what not to do in situations. Uhm as time goes on and as you progress in your your tours you'll start to notice that sailors will watch every everything that you do and what you say. And eventually they'll come to you and ask you for advice, sir. How do I do this? Sir, if you were in this situation, what would you do? And that's how you change culture. It takes time, but you leave by example and you stay present You You will eventually move that culture on being a more positive and productive environment."
,,jd_thomas,How has your view of this line of work changed over time?,"my view of this line of work, it's it hasn't changed that much. Um, again, you just kind of go into each and every situation each and every tour, looking too affected positively and the things that you learn and the things the ordeals and experiences that you go through it you just take it on as a learning experience, something that you could add into your toolbox to help someone or something going forward. So my outlook on this career it is still the same still move, headed out to save the world or help someone save the work. And just to be in incorporate a positive and productive working environment in whatever command, a situation that I'm going into."
,,jd_thomas,What priorities would you recommend for a person entering this field?,"all right. So for person entering this field, I'll give you three priorities. The first and these are from 1 to 3. It may sound counterintuitive or kind of backwards, but you hear me out, the first priority will be self care. You always have to take care of yourself so physically, Mentally, emotionally, spiritually, financially. All five of those things are you should take those into account. Um when in terms of these powers, number two will be your family and friends, Your family and friends were allowing you for support. So be there for them as best you can. With the time that you have. Don't neglect him. Don't push them away. If you have issues with them or problems amongst each other, do your best to work out those conflicts and move forward. Your time on here on land with them is limited. So you always have to be a sea Ships will be at sea. Ships will operate so your time is limited. So spend what time you have with your family and friends and you know, joyous occasions. Number three in terms of Navy number three is navy. The Navy is 1/3 priority in my book simply because you can't take care of the Navy if you don't first take care of yourself and to take care of your family. If you don't take care of number, want numbers one and two. Your focus will not be on the Navy's mission, so prioritize those three. I'll fry Tito. I prioritize those three like that. Um, yeah."
,,jd_thomas,What skills do you wish you had mastered before entering your profession?,"There's probably the biggest skill that I would say I needed. Toe should have mastered before at least attempted to would be add me. Uh, the Navy and the military in general is very ad man paperwork heavy. So if you don't have a clear understanding of what what's required of you and how Thio managed that the admin side off being a leader, uh, you're definitely going to struggle, so that's one skill I wish I would have mastered early on."
,,jd_thomas,What is one question you wished you asked earlier?,"the one question I wish I would have asked earlier. Um, and it's also another question that I ask off a lot of seniors is how do you get, How do I get better? Two. In becoming the person I envisioned myself being once I retire. So I think we all as human beings want to be the best husband, wife, father, mother, aunt, uncle friend, uh, commanding officer, Master chief or whatever it may be, you want to be the best at it. You want to be good at it. You want to be looked at as being a a, uh, leader in that field in terms off. You know how people look up to you, a role model in that field. So that's one question that I I wish I would have asked myself early on, even in childhood, is How do I How do I improve? How do I get better? What things do I need to do to become a better person?"
,,jd_thomas,"As a leader, how much more will I know about the overall goals of the work I am doing?","as you progress in your career, you'll be privileged to Maur, um, information. And yes, that's important, in a sense, but not in the sense that you may think of. Of the key here will be, too, is how do you discern what to relay and what not relate to your peers and to your family and to your sailors. So you may be on some very secret squirrel mission or whatever it may be wherever it may be, and you'll have to understand what to say and what not to say to these people because, you know, let's face it, we all work better when we know what we're what when we know what we're doing and why we're doing so if I understand that, Hey, I'm doing, I'm fixing this whatever piece of equipment it maybe in order to, uh, I don't know, accomplished some mission somewhere. Then I'll work a little bit more at it. I work just a little bit more hard. I'll pay a little bit more attention to it, so you, as a leader, will have to find that balance of how to motivate how to keep your sailors and your peers motivated. But at the same time not giving him up enough, not giving him too much information toe where it may be, ah, issue going forward."
,,jd_thomas,What was the most difficult part of your training?,"The most difficult part is all my training would probably be being away from my friends and family. Um, I'm a very, uh loving, caring, family oriented person, so there interact my interaction with them daily. Weekly monthly, however it may be, plays a lot into my my psyche, so not being able to communicate with them as often as I like early on played a big part of it was very difficult for me to, uh, um, like, operate throughout training or conduct myself throughout training. But it's a part of the job being in this career path. You spend days, weeks, maybe even months without seeing you're seeing or being able to converse with your family and friends. So as time goes on, you learn to manage and you learn to deal with it."
,,jd_thomas,How you can lead honorably?,"leading honorably is not. Trick is not difficult at all. Again, you lead by example. You do what, uh, you think is right. And my dad, he's every time I see him on when I leave home, he says the same thing. You know, stay true to yourself and do what's right. If you stay true to yourself and you do what's right, you communicate well. It's not. Not difficult, all the lead honorably, you'll never go wrong."
,,jd_thomas,"You are having a conflict in the first few days in your platoon, is that normal or no?","conflict is normal all all around. A lot of people avoid it. Some people look forward to it, but conflict it's it's a part of job. Just imagine that you're you've got new personalities, different personalities, different people from all walks of life, all different backgrounds. I mean, it's Ah, it's kind of a Milton pot. So you put all of these people in one small area. You're bound to have a confident. The key here is to be able to solve that conflict and move forward and continue in a continue to operate in a positive and productive working environment. You don't have to be someone friends who worked with him just respect and respect them and be cordial. And that's how you just move forward. Just don't hold on to those negative issues and those negative thoughts in those, uh, those problems. Just solve it and move forward and just always be respectful"
,,jd_thomas,"What are some good resources to look at before starting (books, videos, classes)?","some good resource is to use before entering the fleet or wherever you may be hit. It would be to use your peers, use mentors. Those are two of my favorites. Asking questions from different and receiving different perspectives on certain situations always helps out. It's always a plus. Thio here, a mentor who's been in a situation, describe how they reacted on the things that the lessons they learned from being in certain situations. That's always a favorite of mine. There are tons of books and magazines and articles on leadership being in different situations. Look, look in the past, uh, there's a tons of situations off leaders and people throughout history who have gone through Ah, you know, different ordeals and experiences. Thio, you know, be successful as leaders. I took a class here at the Naval Postgraduate School my first quarter, and it discussed the, um, um, a disaster down on one of light headed towards like the Antarctica, an Arctic and about a group of sailors who were stuck down there for almost a year and 1/2 and the story revolved around the the Captain who got hit. He got his crew out of there So there are tons of resource that you used, Thio. You no further develop. But you again you have to take your ego out of it and listen and learn and read from a different perspective."
,,jd_thomas,How do you spend most of your time at work?,"most of my time at work was spent basically mentor or doing paperwork again. I kind of go by the notion toe lead by example on the way to impact a culture would be too have people seeing you doing with your request of them. And if they see you working, they're more inclined to work. They say you're doing the right thing. They're more inclined to do the right thing. So that's how I spent most of my time at work."
,,jd_thomas,What was your first major leadership role?,"My first major leadership role in the Navy would be the repair officer role as an incident on the USS Lassen, but also I could compare that to being a big brother on and a role model throughout my community."
,,jd_thomas,Describe the work you did on a typical day.,"so on a typical day on the U. S. Has lasted as repair officer. My day typically started very early, anywhere from 4 to 5 a.m. dependent on the white schedule and depending on if we were in port or etc. Just kind of blend in a couple of things. The main thing was to be be present and to know before your bosses no, and always give out clear communication. So in order to do that, you have to be up early and make around. So I would get up early, get ready, you know, which includes, like you know, your shower and everything. And then you get up and you want you making rounds. Walk your spaces. Make sure that your sailor see you out there early in the morning. And I often head up to the quarterdeck to see if there are any issues of within my personnel or something that I need to be notified off after that, you know, grab a quick breakfast and just go see a division walk around before quarters, meet them at quarters, you know, just kind of playing out your day from there. That kind of goes around your wife's schedule, your training schedule and you're studying schedule because you're always qualified. You're always trying to qualify for something, so you have to fit those three things in White's division training, why it's division training and that this that was basically my day, every day."
,,jd_thomas,Describe the physical environments in which you've worked.,"the physical environment where I worked it very so. Typically has a first tour. You're standing bridge watch or combat watch, so bridge watch. Depending on where you are located in the world, it could be cold. It could be high. It'll be warm. It could be humid, but it was very rewarding because you could, you know, you're always privileged to have the sunshine or the elements out. Combat watches always cold. They have to keep the equipment cold, so going from the bridge down to combat is like walking from, say, asana to a freezer and sitting in the freezer off. During training. You're typically walking through the main spaces, and the main bases can reach upwards of 100 degrees on average because of all the machinery and all the fluids and all the heat that's generated, so it just varies. It depends, So you have to kind of be ready for, you know, everything"
,,jd_thomas,How many hours do you work in a typical week?,"um, for a typical week, I'd probably say about maybe 80. Depend if you're deployed. It's probably about 70 80 import, I say about maybe 50 55 on average, your typical day in port, you're probably working. I'd say about 12 hours a day at sea. I'd bump that up anywhere from 12 toe 18 hours a day."
,,jd_thomas,What kinds of decisions do you make in your career on a daily basis?,"so far his decisions. You're you're making split decisions like every two or three minutes. There's always something with the division that I, which was like I said about 26 27 people. Everyone has a personality. Everyone has an issue. Everyone has something going on and not to include the ship's schedule. Where there's training, where there's evolutions, where there's always something happening, and then not to mention, you have to stay and watch. You have to get your training and your qualifications in. So that doesn't include communicating with your boss's your supervisors, which are, You know, your second tour is your department is maybe even XO. So you're making decisions on where to go next. Who to talk to next? What to do next? Did I email this person that I call this person that I talked to this person? Have I done this? Have I done that? So they're split decisions made like every don't know, 30 seconds or so"
,,jd_thomas,What kinds of problems do you deal with?,"a SZ faras problems. You deal with just about anything that you can think of mainly personnel issues or admin issues. I think those who are like the big ones, um, the third would probably be material which in which things break. And you have to establish, like a priority in which, what problems get fixed first. And who do you have to fix? What problems Manning issues. We need these three people to go here, but we have this evolution going on over here. It's just your problems can range from personal and would say, sailors, family member, you know hasn't having some issues. And you have to literally like, you know, stop what you're doing to make sure that they're focused to do the job that they're supposed to do, as opposed to focusing on what's going on back home. So you have to be well, well rounded and well versed and very patient when it comes to dealing with a multitude of problems. Always tell people to be the be the eye of a storm. Basically, you know, stay call, think things through and do not react how you feel the most of the time"
,,jd_thomas,What is a story that really shows what it is like working in your job?,"Okay, I give you a great example of what? What's What was a typical day? Um, I would like to say we we were pulling into maybe Panama on deployment. And we needed this, like, this part that it weighed about £200 to We had to get it from off the ship, which was on the pier to the folks off the front of the ship all the way to the bottom of the ship in order to have an install. But this part weighed about £200. So I just come off watch and we were rounding up, you know, everyone to see if we can get this thing down there. And it took us about 15 20 minutes to round up everyone because people are scattered throughout the ship. So once we got everybody rounded up, um, we located a like a shaft that leads all the way to the bottom of the ship from the folks. So the idea was to have a crane load the part onto the folks and lower it down for us. Easy day. Well, wow. The crane was like bringing the part on board the shaft on the crane broke, so they had to set the crane down. So it was. It ended up on the folks who but we still had to get to the bottom of ship. This thing weighed about £200 of dead weight. So we were, um actually, you know, being rushed. And, you know, the captain just kind of walked through and just kind of noticed, like, what was going on. So he ended up giving me that look like you know what you're gonna do now, right? So we had everybody there, So we grabbed a boast of mate and asked him to tie a few nights. And we are tired of the part, and it took probably about 10 of us, and we horsed it down. I think it was about maybe, like, seven flights of, uh, upstairs or something to, like, lower it down to the bottom of that ship. And after that, we ended up going to another evolution because we were inter import. So we had thio get out how the hospital service is hooked up and you know your water and fresh water. You're great water and all that kind of stuff. It was just like a typical day, you know,"
,,jd_thomas,What are the major benefits of doing this kind of work?,"the major benefits. Ah, of doing something like this would be experience and knowledge and also being ableto, you know, teaching you to be resourceful. But at the same time, it also teaches you to deal with a lot of stress, and if you can handle stress, you can handle almost anything."
,,jd_thomas,What are the major negatives of doing this kind of work?,"the major negatives to doing this kind of work would be stress. You deal with a light day in and day out. Um, and sometimes it may feel as a CZ. If it's too much to handle. You don't sleep much. Um, you're always on the gold, so you kind of your mind is almost retard and how it operates. So you're you spend a lot of time like even resting, trying to slow your mind down and, like, operate out of normal level. So it's kind of tough toe decompress at times when operating and working on the under a an environment like"
,,jd_thomas,How much travel do you do in a year?,"in a typical year. Travel basically depends on whether you're on sea duty, on shore duty, my shore duty or Mitzi Duty. I would say I was going probably nine months out of 12. We went on three patrols, which were about three months each, and the one month that we would have import was spent preparing to go back out to sea. So you definitely traveled a lot. I went to probably maybe 78 different countries. Way went to a lot of different ports. It was definitely a fun experience. It was an awesome experience. Stressful did a lot of work. But, you know, we went to places like Korea, South Korea, Malaysia. I'm forgetting a couple names. You don't want to a place a few places in South Japan. Afterwards, we traveled toe. Why San Diego Mexico stopped in a few places to refuel, even went to a small island called Cy Pain, which was also"
,,jd_thomas,Why do you love your job?,"was not to love about my job. I think the big three things that come to mind would be the experience and guidance that you offer that you're able to offer fellow sailors. And that would be, you know, subordinates, peers and sometimes even seniors. You know, outside of that the travel I've been and been to places and I've seen things that you know my parents will never see have never seen. I think it's helped me grow as a person tremendously. Another thing would probably be the benefits that come with being a serviceman. The pay not to mention, uh, the, um, career development, but also the opportunities that come with being a sailor, which would be, you know, the networking opportunities being able to, you know, I have friends all over the world, family, all of the world."
,,jd_thomas,What gets romanticized about your career field that really isn't that great?,"So one thing that's romanticize about being officer is actually the range. A lot of sailors. When you're in tough decisions or say you're in a vision or department, you have like a huge inspection coming up or, you know, and they're your divisional departments having some issues, the common thing that you'll hear a lot. Iss Hey, that's why you get paid the big books, you know? So it's Ah, very, very romanticized Thio. You know where the rain But there's a lot of responsibilities that come with the rent, so I think that's probably the main thing."
,,jd_thomas,What are some of the common misconceptions about your field?,"I think one main misconception is that your that you operate with a sort of privilege and that you're like born into like this opportunity, that you're just different, that you're special. I think that's the big thing I liketo believe. And I really do feel this way that I'm just like you. I'm just like anyone else who I'm serving with. It's just I had a different opportunity. Someone told me about a program that this person didn't know about. Someone gave me opportunity tohave this chance to, you know, serve, serve our country that someone else didn't know about. So I think that's the big thing. Is that your sole special and that you're different? You're like you're cut from a different cloth or something like that. But how big a difference"
,,jd_thomas,What do you do now that is different from what you thought you would be doing?,"Um, I don't think there's anything different. I've always approached being a leader by being humbled by being almost like being being a follower first. If you can follow, you can lead. So if you leave with empathy, you understand how how it fields or what it's like to follow someone, then there's really no difference."
,,jd_thomas,How did your work day change over your career?,"over my career. My word. They changed based on the demands of the command and on the the the commanding officer. So that's typically how your work they will change. So how you operate and approach your work day prior to deployment will be totally different than how you operate and approach the workday after a deployment. And the same can be said for dealing with inspections prior to inspection, say an insert. You can expect that your command will have six, maybe even seven day work weeks. But you pass that inspection on that insert, and you can expect that your work there will be totally different."
,,jd_thomas,"Where did you have to move in your career, and how did that change things each time?","so I would say that my career is kind of unique over the past eight years, I think I've moved maybe four or five times, and that's I think that's a unique situation. Prior to being commissioned Officer, I was enlisted as a undesignated airman for two years in Jacksonville. After earning my Camilo after applying O. C. S, I was given opportunity to earn my commission, which meant I had to move to Rhode Island. I was a earned my commission as a naval flight officer, so I left Rhode Island and went to Pensacola. I was down in Pensacola for about eight months in which I was tried it from flight school for a number of issues. I left went to San Diego for training in San Diego six months. So after their being in San Diego for six months of me and redesignated as a swot, I left for Japan for 20 months. So I was in Japan 20 months, and then my tour ended, and then I ended up back in Jacksonville as a surface warfare office on a desk downstairs, and I was there for two years after Ben and Jacksonville for two years. I left, and now I'm here in California. So the rolls were a lot different. The demands were a lot different. But if you approach it your day almost you approach the day almost the same. It depends on the demands that are set upon the command and what the commanding officer expects out of his staff and his ship. So a lot of times, the commanding officer kind of dictates how ah, persons or his sailors days go his or her sailors Day goes."
,,jd_thomas,Where do you see yourself in 5 years? 10?,"in five years, I see myself finishing my either my second tour department head right or my early command right, going back to shore duty. So I'll be probably headed to the Pentagon to work on a staff utilizing my master's in business administration and financial management from Naval Postgraduate School. 10 years. I expect to be finishing my XO Sio tour onboard, probably a DDG or maybe a new frigate."
,,jd_thomas,What's up?,not much. Trying to stay out of trouble. How about you?
,,jd_thomas,How is the weather?,the weather is fire.
,,jd_thomas,How are you?,I'm doing all right.
,,jd_thomas,Where are you?,I'm in the library at the Naval Postgraduate School here in California.
,,jd_thomas,What is your favorite color?,my favorite color is Georgia really?
,,jd_thomas,What's your favorite book of all time? Why?,"my favorite book of all time would probably have to be the Bible. I'm not so much spiritually more spiritual than I am religious, and the story's always teach me different."
,,jd_thomas,What's your favorite movie of all time? Why?,"Ah, that's a tough one. Um, I'm I'm kind of a movie buff. So right now, I'd probably have to be Ah, probably Black Panther."
,,jd_thomas,"If you could meet anyone in the world today, who would it be and why? What would you say to that person?","if I could meet anyone, the world today would probably be the former president. Barack Obama and I would just like to pick his brain or leadership on High Bannon balanced the work, life work and family. You know, um, ratio and, you know, just pick his brain about the different experiences and the things he's learned over the past 12 or 15."
,,jd_thomas,What person do you most admire and why?,"the person that I most admire. Probably. It'll probably be about four or five different people right now. Very found very family oriented. So probably my my parents, my brothers, Andi, even my my niece right now."
,,jd_thomas,Where were you born?,I was born in a small town called Augusta.
,,jd_thomas,Tell me a funny story.,"um, I'll give you a funny story that just happen this morning. Um, I got up as usual, and, um, I've got, like, a big truck. I have a big re a truck. So I was actually trying to get my stuff loaded into the truck and stepped on the steppe bar. I didn't have the right footing, slipped and ended up on my backside right out in the driveway this morning, so that definitely was a humbling experience."
,,jd_thomas,What is your favorite food?,"my favorite food will probably have to be, Ah, banana pudding."
,,jd_thomas,What is your least favorite food?,my least favorite food would probably be.
,,jd_thomas,What is the best military perk you experienced?,best military perk of experience would probably have to be using the V A loan to purchase a house.
,,jd_thomas,What was the coolest thing you did in the Navy?,"coolest thing that I've done in the Navy so far would have to be counterdrug ops down off the coast of Colombia. Uh, well, I was on board the USS Lassen, which is a DDG, and we were working with the U. S. Coast guard to prevent, um or deter, uh, drug smugglers from getting cocaine and into Mexico into North America. So we would basically find small boats and use our pillows and our small boats and our ship Thio, pursue and, you know, hunt down these drug smugglers. And it was It was It was awesome. It was."
,,jd_thomas,What have you done that got a lot press?,"in 2015 I was part of the USS Lassen crew, and we were tasked to do a freedom of navigation operation down in the South China Sea. And I actually stood the junior officer of the deck at the time, and, uh, I was able to, um, participate in this mission and the mission it up on CNN and even a question on jeopardy. I know the word that I got was that, you know, me speaking over the radio to the our Chinese counterparts made it all way up to President Obama. So it was It was an awesome experience toe, you know, get word that the president her me speak."
,,jd_thomas,Describe your ideal team.,"my ideal team would be, uh, basically a group that is selfless, selfless, motivated and with a good work ethic."
,,jd_thomas,How can you lead by example? (What specific things do you do?),"In order to lead by example, you have to have a the ability to empathize. And what I mean by empathize with that would be the look at a situation from someone else's point of view. If you understand how it feels and what it means to be late, then you could lead by example."
,,jd_thomas,What are some tips to earn the trust of my team?,"simple tips on the trust of your team are, uh, doing things like, if you wouldn't ask someone to do something that you wouldn't do yourself, uh, doing things with your team, building that team cohesion by being present, working with asking questions of them, asking things, asking for their opinion. Um, those are simple things. That, too developed team cohesion and build a report with your team."
,,jd_thomas,How do you connect more deeply with your team members?,"in order to connect with your team. That takes time. Some people don't respond or trust is early and often as you'd like. But uh, being present, you'll notice and working with and even working in certain evolutions of doing certain things that you know divisions, departments and commands do there'll be a plaintive, opportune time for you to have simple conversations. And as time goes on, those conversations will get deeper and your you'll learn more about each other and they'll ask you questions and you know you'll be able to relate to them and the conversation. Just go deeper and deeper and you'll learn more and more."
,,jd_thomas,"How do I build trust between different team members (e.g., new ones, ones with bad interactions)?","in order, Teoh build trust among team members. That kind of relies on you as a leader but also being able to communicate with the more senior leaders and even the most senior leaders. But the more senior team members and the team members that have been there the longest. So it's not all on you. Excuse me, It's not all on you. It's amongst each other. So established that culture of trusting and developing each other and it'll trickle down. The trickle down effect will occur and you will go through some some bumps in the road. But that's up to you. Toe. Establish that communication amongst those the parties of all involved."
,,jd_thomas,What are good strategies to have the right kind of presence with my team?,"good strategies would be to again empathize. I typically would make routine rounds with the team, so I would come in, you know, in the morning, right before lunch after lunch sometime in the evening and be present during special evolutions. If you know your your team has, say, evolution to training evolution, you might want to be around for Be around for the meetings. Bill around. Just be there. Be be around. It adds your input when it's needed. Sometimes you'll have toe play. What I call would be the sword in the shield. Well, they might need someone to speak up for them to a senior, And you might be there might be that guy to take the sword and go out and do what you need to do and speak for them. But at the same time, if something happens, that's, um, like, not so good for your your team as, say, a training evolution didn't go is playing. You need to be there to defend them, but how would you defend him if you're not there?"
,,jd_thomas,How do you and your work colleagues socialize outside of work?,"uh, we are socialized, just like any other group. We plan, you know, bowling trips. We go out, you know, hang out and go get some. You know, we take our families out for dinners and sometimes breakfast. Sometimes we'll go out. And do you know why? The reason things of that nature so is typically it is just like any other group of friends or group of colleagues. You just get together your playing something, you know, where everybody's free. Just, you know, go hang out."
,,jd_thomas,How should your relationship be with your subordinates (close vs. far)?,"um, as far as relationship with us subordinates, I had ah, Chief Petty officer. Once he told me that if you always keep it professional, you would never have to worry about anything. So I would take that notion if you and I would add onto it. Stay professional, stay respectful, Stay cordial and and yummy includes something in your personality. Never always be genuine is what I'm trying to say. So genuineness. Be cordial. Be respectful, be professional and be respected and just stay true to yourself. And things will flow how they're supposed to flow now. Giving you won't get along and be buddy buddy with everyone. But you keep those things in mind and you will always have a positive and productive working environment with those subordinates."
,,jd_thomas,"How do I help my team prepare for a tough mission (e.g., inspection, long mission)?","preparing for a tough situation or even a stressful situation. It could be. You could even be an inspection that's come up. You don't prepare for that mission or that inspection while it's right before it's happening. So it's a mindset. So you prepare, just like you would prepare them for, say, a football game. Or for a baseball game you have to encourage them. You have to motivate them. You have to be positive. You have to. You have to be that be the one motivating factor behind the team. So you encourage them by, you know, being there. I'm a very vocal and bushes person. So my thing waas too Yeldon screen. You know, if we're about to start a revolution and say an inspection is about to happen and I'm out there, I'm yelling, I'm screaming. I'm encouraging my team. I'm letting them know that Lieutenant Thomas is behind. You were there. Whether we win, lose, fail, we're going to do it together. And I think just having that that backing that support says a lot, So just be, be there, be there to encourage and just let him know you. You're their support system that you got"
,,jd_thomas,What kinds of people should I use certain leadership strategies with?,"I think that depends on the person that depends on you. Um though is there is no no one one size fits all type thing. So you can't say with this type of person. I'm gonna do this with this type of person. I'm going to do that. You have Teoh, learn and you know, just kind of gain that experience by doing it. You won't be successful in every matter, but what you can do is communicate. You can sit down with the sailor and say, Hey, you know I'm trying. Teoh established this kind of culture. I'm trying to do X, Y and Z and respond to feedback. That's the big thing. Communicate and responding feedback. So if you see something is not working with a certain sailor, try something different. What's the worst that could happen if you go talk to someone? Really Nothing. So communicate. Sit down and talk with. That's how you That's how you move forward. That's how you deal with a wide multitude of people. You communicate, you listen. You observe, watch how they respond to you. When you say certain things, watch how they respond with starting other things happen. For example, I knew certain sailors didn't, you know, respond well to me screaming and yelling or, you know, just being very playful or something. So you wouldn't be that way with that sailor. You know what I mean? You just have to respond accordingly. So but always, uh, observe and listen more than you speak and follow their verbal and nonverbal cues. That's basically it."
,,jd_thomas,What counseling skills are important?,"council skills for a leader, I would definitely say, and I keep saying this one over and over its ability to empathize If you have to counsel a sailor, the first question you should ask yourself is, How would I want someone to approach me in the same situation if I were in that situation? And how you respond in your mind is nine times out of 10 how you should respond to that sailor? So if you don't respond well to someone yelling and screaming at you, why would you yell and scream at a safe? If you don't respond well to some one person that you why would you curse satisfied in a council? The situation? Um, my thing was, in terms of Council of Sailors is a a quote man to man or man to woman sit down personal closed door conversation where we discussed what happened, why it happened, and the reasoning behind their behavior and how we fix that going forward and what I have to do in terms of being a leader going forward and what my expectations are of him or her moving forward. So the bottom line is you communicate and be respectful and empathize. I keep saying that you were in for that"
,,jd_thomas,How do I push my team to meet the standards (if they are having trouble meeting them)?,"you're pushers your team to meet standards, do you? It's simple early and often you communicate your standards and what's expected of them. And you reinforced those expectations early enough by being present by being around them by displaying those standards by pushing those standards by encouraging them to meet those standards, it'll it might take time. Some teams take longer than others, and you will eventually get there. But one key Teoh this method is you also have to, um, you also have to. I'm trying to figure out the words to say You have to lay out a plan to get there so you can't lead the blind if you're blind blind. Can't leave the blood so established A plan to get to those standards and take your team throughout those steps and move forward. Move accordingly. That's that's one way that I couldn't I could think of"
,,jd_thomas,How should you reward your sailors for good performance?,"again, my answer would be dependent events. Um, is that good? Performance expected? Sailors respond to basically two things, and that's more money and more liberty. So in terms of good performance or exceptional performance outside of you know them performing their basic duties a day off two days off and in some cases, three days off, you reward sailors with liberty."
,,jd_thomas,What qualifications do you look for when interviewing new team members?,"nuke qualifications. It depends on the requirements assed faras qualifications. But in terms off personality traits, um, work ethic is a big one. Initiative is a big one. Um, attitude is a big so those are probably be three huge factors in terms of looking for a team member. Other things you can kind of develop and work to develop going forward. But if they have a work effort, work ethic, that's like half the battle because of you, a person works hard and they take the initiative to do something. That's kind of ah, what a lot of people in the Navy say a fire forget because I can ask a person to do something. And before I'm finished with my question, there is already halfway done, so work ethic is is huge for me."
,,jd_thomas,How should your relationship be with the people in charge of you?,"as far as relationship with those in charge. Again, you respond to, uh, verbal and non verbal cues, and also by keeping it professional and respectful. You have a lot off seniors who have, ah, difficult time responding to the new generation of sailors that are coming in. So it's kind of hard to for them to empathize and understand how to approach in interact with some of the younger service. And that's understandable. But you as a a subordinate to, say a senior, you have to be able to understand that things aren't perfect. Take your ego out of it and find out what makes the boss t What makes them happy. And what makes them happy will make you happy because they're happy. So with that relationship, just do your best to keep it professional and respectful. If you keep it professional, you won't have to wear about anything going south. So nine times out of 10 don't respond with how you really feel. Just keep it professional and keep it respectful. Sometimes you may feel like you want to react like in a negative manner, but that won't go well for you, so keep it professional and keep a respectful"
,,jd_thomas,What would you advise a person in this field to get to know their bosses?,"um, simple words of advice for me, for someone to understand, to get to know their bosses would be to listen. Listen, in the observant again, you will be able to see the things they do. You hear the things that they talk about, and as time goes on, they will open up to you about the things that they like to do, the things that they like to talk about. And that would be your opportunity. Teoh, you know, find some common area that you guys share. I like fishing. So chances are if we walk by, we were walking and you were a subordinate of man and we're walking by. I say, I don't know efficient pollen or something. You might hear me say something like, You know, I wish I had a ride or something. I could go fishing right now and that will be your opportunity. It's simple and subtle. Things like that. Uh, just listen and observe"
,,jd_thomas,How do you get good feedback from supervisors?,"um, with supervisors who are unwilling or unable to give you feedback again, you have to. This is kind of a tough one, because there are personnel out there who don't really respond to feet that oh, are you don't give feedback when things are good or things are bad. You simply have to take note of, um, the demands that they're placed under and what's required of those. The man. Um, as time goes on your you'll learn the things that they like, whether it be certain colors and power points of certain graphs and power points, certain products handed or email to them and certain times of day times of the day. But it's definitely just something for you, too. You just have to learn. Um, it's also within your ability to actually going up in approach a senior and say, you know, respond and ask the question. You know, how do you like certain things? How do you like this? What products do you want? You know, Do you want eight o'clock reports delivered at five o'clock? Do you want you know, things in writing Do would you rather me call you? You know those are things the questions that you have to take the initiative and have the developed the forethought to ask of a senior if they are willing to offer."
,,jd_thomas,What encourages accountability?,"things that encourage accountability are, um, one of my favorites. This would be ownership. So throughout your command, throughout your division, throughout your department and even, you know, just in general, people respond better when they feel as if they own something. And that simple notion will encourage someone to be accountable for their equipment before a program. So throughout your team to develop or encourage accountability would be to give a sailor program and sit down and communicate with them your expectations and your standards and encourage them to make this program the best or, you know, to pass an expectation, you know, whatever it may be. But that sense of ownership encourages accountability alone. But you just have to be the leader to find that that that sailor, that you can apply to that program, Teoh, you know, move for so ownership encourages accountability in my pain"
,,jd_thomas,What are ways you can identify the strengths and limitations for each member of your team?,"um, I didn't find the strength of regencies. It's kind of a simple, and it goes back to two more words. I keep saying, Listen and observe. By being present and being around your team, you'll notice who's more vocal. You'll notice who will stand out as being You know, the goal getter, the hard worker. You'll notice who will be more of the quiet one that doesn't do too much or doesn't save much, even when, during like 30 training evolutions or even like operating, you know who's the first to step up or who won't step up. And by being around and watching how that occurs, you'll learn where one sailor has one strength and another one has a weakness, and you can kind of pairing together and turn in that aspect. Eso As time goes on, the more you watching, the more you around your sailors and your team, you'll see who has certain strengths and who has certain weaknesses and that all that kind allowed you to manage. You know who to put with who and how the better, you know, go for how to move on from there"
,,jd_thomas,How is it different to manage military people vs. civilians in the military?,"um, it's a working with saying Isn't working with movies is totally different. Civilians are mawr relaxed. They're more casual. There are peaceful sailors are at times very high, strong because they're so used to operating under certain environments. And that's kind of like how well, we're kind of compare it to like a yin and the Yang there's like Ah, hi, strong, you know, Go, go, go, go, go sailor mentality. But then, on the civilian side, it's kind of like a slow down back it down. Here's what we need to do. So it z awesome working with severe and I think that's just a big difference is just the tempo that we operate on."
,,jd_thomas,What is the difference between working in the public vs. private sectors?,"um, the big difference between working privacy you're in, like, say, is working in the military, uh, would be the for one the tempo to the stress level. And three. It's kind of tough to explain, but there's there in the military you you're always under like the watchful eye of something that I think that's the big thing. It's like you're you're always under the microscope when you're in the military. So everything that you say you do, you're being like scrutinized for you, man. Watch for, say, for example, incident happens out in town, and I'm in my uniform the difference between me being in that incident as a civilian between and now, you know, in my uniform it's looked at as, Hey, Naval Officer did X, y and Z. But if I was as a civilian, it will just be J. D. V. This, you know, you represent a larger ah group of people, a larger organization and I think that plays ah big part into a person's like a day to day operations as faras the differences, but also you get there. You know, there's like a different, um, sense of. I guess you could say freedom as a civilian, as opposed to been in the military. Because every day I think I like, Hey, I'll be I don't I won't be I won't be anywhere permanently So this is temporary for me, So I always have to go back to see I'll always be moving. So those just, ah, few things that play into you know, the difference is, I guess."
,,jd_thomas,What makes the navy different than other branches of the military?,"um the differences between us and the other branches are for one. I think our culture, um, a big day for me, especially when I joined, was the fact that if you join the Navy nine times out of 10 you will be around some form of water and, uh, unlike being an air force of the Army or the Marines. I didn't want to be anywhere near the desert or anywhere near, like a bunch of just like nature. I didn't want to sleep after sleep out in the field. I rather sleep in a little cotton on the ship at the bottom of the ship, as opposed to sleeping out in the desert. So I would say those are like, two of the big things is just the the locations that you're operating here and the climates and environments operating in and just the culture of being a sailor. Um, being on the inside, you can kind of notice like a definitely a rah rah. You know, uh, mentality out of the say, the Marines and the Army and the Air Force is more like laid back, like we're kind of casual on the neighbors, just kind of like in the middle, you know,"
,,jd_thomas,Describe an experience that illuminates (Navy) culture.,"I'm sorry and experience that illuminates Navy culture. Um, I would say it's classic, and I'm pretty sure everyone experiences is this is Ah definitely would have to say, returning from a deployment say onboard like any any ship after a long period out of C. Uh so the general excitement among the crew and you know each other's It just kind of raises morale because you know you're going home. You know, everyone's kind of walking on like Cloud now, like the last couple of days, and it's almost like a kid going to Disney World for the first time the night before. It's like that kid and sleep is just so excited to read to go home. You know, you're just ready to see your family and friends. And, uh, that culture just kind of hits its peak the day off when everyone is putting on their dress whites. So the dress blues and we're getting already and pressed and everything is nice and, you know, you finally hear the the man the rails called on the one EMC, and that's how you know it's like you're going home. And I think that that culture kind of hits it hits its peak at that time toe where you're putting import and you and all your 300 of your closest friends are going home for the first time in seven or eight months on. And I think that just kind of, you know, that just sums up like Navy culture, right?"
,,jd_thomas,"How do you help morale? (e.g., when the crew was supposed to go home but needs to stay active/at sea)","so a number of ways that you can affect morale is for one your personally. It's about being positive. Um, and I would like to think that a positive attitude is contagious. So the more you're smiling, the more that you're being positive about things. The more others will be positive about things on board, like certain ships are every ship that I have been on. I had the privilege of being on. There are definitely a number of activities that you can engage in which you start with each other to, you know, help building around. There's bingo night. There's, Ah, video game night. There's our hop night where you know the CS is Get around and they cook. I hopped pancakes for an omelet for dinner. You know that ice cream night? There's pizza and Chicken wing night, but also you have certain activities that sometimes that the captain will push, which are like they allow beards. So you pay the into the nwr fun, say, three bucks or so, and you can grow your beard out. Do you? You know, you come back in port, so you know, that's like a big morale booster. Believe it or not? Is it zip? It may seem very small, but something like that will build morale very quickly If I don't have to get up and say you everyone and I can walk around with beer. Um, but things like that, um, those air about, you know, just about the limits that a person can do or someone can do to affect morale. When you have obligations to meet outside of that, you know, put import as often as you are allowed to and getting off the ship and just been able to decompress and are going tours and see things. And, uh, those are about the best that you can do to build around."
,,jd_thomas,Who are the core team members (inner circle) who you relied on as a leader?,"the core team members. Alberts. Our light on would be, um, definitely your chief Petty officer. If you are a division officer, your chief petty officer, your department here and a number of your peers, these would be people that you were basically, you know, talked with numerous times throughout the day. And, uh, they will be able Teoh excuse me? Assist you with personal issues. You may be dealing with a professional issues you may be dealing with offer guidance. You may be a bit offer guidance to them. So I would definitely say a department hit and your peers and a chief petty officer."
,,jd_thomas,"If you have trouble listening well, what strategies can help you to listen well?","strategies to help Listen, Will would be to first acknowledge that you have a problem listening with to, um, take note of it while you're listening to someone's talk or attempting to listen to one to someone. Speak, Be mindful of how much you interrupt of how much you speak or you attempt to speak. I always say that people there are two types of people, people who listen to respond and people who listen to understand. If you know that you're a person that listens to respond, practice not responding practice, listening, engaging, active listening. Which would be say, if you're speaking to me, maybe not, maybe respond. Ask a question while they're speaking, and as time goes on, you'll just develop those habits of not speaking while someone else is. You know why you're supposed to be listening? Try to repeat things in your mind that that person is saying, and those things are definitely get you started on the right path of being a being a better listener"

Maybe, you know, everyone has their bad days, and, you know, sometimes you just you don't feel like doing. You don't feel like, you know. But what makes the decision for me is the fact that there's a team of sailors or peers and even seniors that are somewhere so, you know, relying on me, too. You know, I helped get them through the day, always like to believe that maybe there there's a sailor who's going through something and me not strong up at work that day could be the day that they feel like a temporary problem is a permanent problem. And that's what an important decision I make every day"
,,jd_thomas,What do you need to know about yourself to lead a team?,"There's a few things that I feel that a person should know about themselves proud to lead a team or even when leading a team. And that one is to know who they are, two to know where they're from. And three, um, how to empathize that 1st 1 Knowing who you are, sailors of smart people. We pick up on a lot of things. We observe and watch a lot. So if you're if you dodge herself, you aren't shoe sure about yourself as a person, and that makes me believe that you aren't fit to lead me into any situation, to know where you're from. I like to believe that a person's family and their friends and their background pays a lot of big, far into their leadership and who they are as a person. So I'd liketo think that I conduct myself in a manner that my grandmother or my mother, my dad and my grandfather would approval if he saw me interacting with and leading a team being able to advertise. I think that's just a part of, you know, just daily living in interacting with each other"
,,jd_thomas,What do you need to know about your team members?,"one big, too big things to know about your team members are their strengths and weaknesses, and you get that by watching them interact with each other of the team's other personnel. A observing who they are as people and how they respond to certain situation. I'm a big proponent proponent of watching someone's verbal and nonverbal cues when I communicate with them, and I think that that will help you learn a lot a SW, far as your team members in terms of their strengths and weaknesses, to better manage them as a team altogether."
,,jd_thomas,What are the most important factors about a situation to consider?,"most important factors about a situation I would say would be the who what, when, where, how and why, UM, understanding the background of a situation and who's involved what's involved, What's the issue? How did it come about will help you on the road to a solution and how to fix it."
,,jd_thomas,What are some secret-sauce tips for your leadership style?,"I don't think there really is a secret sauce. It's just understanding that we're all human and we're We're here to whatever situation it may be on a different circumstances, eh? So if you can respect someone, if you can be professional, if you can empathize with someone and you can communicate with someone, I feel as if everything will work out the way it's supposed to be. There is no super sauce."
,,jd_thomas,What leadership strategies are dying out?,"few leadership strategies are one I would say leading by example. I think that's my leadership style. I don't I don't think enough people, um, are willing to lead by example. The do is I do not do as I say method, and I think that that kind of goes a long way."
,,jd_thomas,What are warning signs for problems in a team?,"There's a couple of warning signs that I looked for it and problems within the team, and that's Ah, selfishness is one and ego. I go by another notion of big team little me. So if you incorporate your ego into a team and it becomes too big, then you put yourself over the team. And then also, if you're acting selfishly, I marks the team. If you're putting yourself before the team, those two things are definitely big warrants that."
,,jd_thomas,How can you enforce the honor code?,"you have forced the honor code simply by communicating your expectations and the standards that are set by those expectations. Um, without communicating what's expected and what they're being governed by, it's almost impossible to to manage the team. So by doing those things and enforcing those things, it's easy to establish the or abide by the articles."
,,jd_thomas,How should I handle people who can't meet their standards?,"first thing is there's no such thing. Can't there's ah, won't. So how do you, uh, assist a person? Thio meet, start, meet the standards is you do it together first Communicate. You have to say I I'm a big proponent of sitting down with sailors one on one and finding the root of a problem discussing what's the issue? Why aren't you? Why haven't you been able to meet a certain standard? What's going on? Is there an internal problem? Is there an external problem and how can we solve that problem and move forward to get you back on track?"
,,jd_thomas,What kinds of sailors cause problems in a team and what can you do to improve it?,"selfish sailors with an ego cause problems on a team. I'm sure we're all watch SportsCenter, and you can tell when certain teams break up, because it's always the same couple of issues, a person acting selfishly and a person acting, you know, out because of their ego. How Thio solve this issue again. It's communication sitting down with that sailor or that team member and trying to figure out what's the issue and how to move forward from there. Can we solve this issue? If we cannot solve this issue, how do we How do we remove you from the team? But I honestly use that as a very, very last resort. There's always a way for, and there's always a route to a problem and a way to solve it. It's just you have to be run this off"
,,jd_thomas,How do you get to the root of a problem with a team member?,"to get to the root of a problem with the team members First is communication you as a leader, you're expected to lead by example, and I keep throwing out the same word is empathy. If you were having issued, how do you want to be late? Would you want someone Thio sit down and talk to you like a human being and discussed the issue and move for? Or do you want to be cursed? That screamed and yelled at, removed from the situation altogether? There's two ways to go about doing that, and I prefer communicating professionally and respectfully to a a sailor who's having issues."
,,jd_thomas,When is breaking the rules okay?,"This one is, in a sense, a tough one, but it's in a sense, it's not. I could easily sit here and say There's no no reason to ever break the roof. But in certain situations there, maybe What if you're asked to fire on some unarmed civilians or some, you know, women and Children, unarmed women and Children? Would you break the rules, Huh? Of disobeying a direct order to not kill women and Children or Woods, So on it see on the service is easy to say. It's never too late."
,,jd_thomas,How can I tell when someone can be influenced versus someone who won't change?,"I think that comes with time and experience. The only way that you'll come to a, uh, a decision about whether someone can be influenced or not is by observing and listening to that person or two the situation."
,,jd_thomas,What conduct issues can mean serious problems if you handle them in-house?,"so in terms of conduct issues Ah, a lot of it is is written in black and white. Um, I would venture to say that to maintain team cohesion, cohesion within your division, I will be best to handle do your best of handles, small issues of certain issues didn't with conduct in house. And as a division officer, you are able to do that. I would also say to cover yourself by putting it on paper. It doesn't really, you know, hurt someone toe right, Someone up for conduct issue. That's no problem. But other issues such as, ah, say a sexual assault or a you know, a physical altercation. Things of that nature of, um or er Oh, I guess you could say on a higher magnitude you were definitely Take that up. The chain of command. It's also safe to say, if you're not sure, ask someone you're not leading a division alone. You have assistance. You have piers. You have ah department here, XO ASIO. So if you're not sure it doesn't hurt to go to someone and seek help. Usual. Resource is is what I'm saying."
,,jd_thomas,Tell me about a time where your priorities conflicted with the priorities of your management.,"um I would definitely meant go out to say that on my first ship. Um, we were definitely were about thio leave port for patrol. And I was having issue personnel issues and I was trying Thio doing my best. Thio, get my personnel ready for the patrol. But they're waas Some of our equipment was down on the pier, and at that moment, you know, my department here was headed down toe I work center Thio express his displeasure with parts of being on the pier and how we should redirect our efforts to get those parts often appear before we left for the patrol with the next day. And, uh, that was just one situation and where my priorities and my divisions priorities have to take a back seat way had to satisfy the needs of my superior in order to move on"
,,jd_thomas,Tell me about a situation where your team and you had a major disagreement about how to handle something.,"a SZ faras our disagreements between my team members and myself. I don't recall actually having too many, and none really sticks out. Like I said, I'm a big fan of this thing called Teamwork makes the dream work. So and I understand as a leader that I'm not always right and what always want without what I am, what I feel should be done. Sometimes that's not what should be done. So, um, I don't recall ever having a situation like that. I'm a big fan of communication and working through a situation using my resource is which could be subject matter experts in the form of 1/3 class, A second class, maybe even the semen. So, you know, I don't I don't recall ever having a major disagreement. And most teams as faras solvent issue"
,,jd_thomas,What kind of risks do you need to take in this field?,"the risk that you'll need to take in this field in terms of personnel with finding that balance of being a sword or a shield on what I mean by that has been being able to stick up knowing win, to stick up for your team members and knowing when to fight for your team members. A CE faras risks in terms off career altogether Um, you're definitely take some risk. Personally, uh, you take a lot of risk by joining the military and joined the Navy in particular, where you risk being out on deployment anywhere from 6 to 11 months. And that can have, ah, huge effect on your personal life. So those are two things that I can say sticks out as far as risk."
,,jd_thomas,What problems or warning signs should you not try to solve and refer up to specialists instead?,"warning signs that you should not try to solve what I would venture to say. Mental health dealing with a stressful job You know that I feel that we're in that so stressful some people aren't able to deal with. And some people resort thio attempted suicide. Some people lash out in physical violence and these are things that you should not try to solve on your own. And you should use the resource is which are so your medical personnel on board and even take it up the chain command with that, you know, being a yurt Excell CEO maybe, and even your department hears, or even your master chiefs are you CMC?"
,,jd_thomas,What do you do when given an impossible situation due to failures that you didn't cause?,"um in situations where there, where there's really no no women in sight, you have to take the high road. I've actually been in a few of these situations where there's really no way for me to succeed, but you take you take the loss gracefully and you don't point fingers. Um, you just try to come to a reasoning why the failures took place and you try to move forward and try to prevent it from happening to someone else. That's how we get around, get around and prepare for it for next time."
,,jd_thomas,"How do you deliver bad news, such as a family emergency?","This one is a very tough one. And the first thing is I'll say is you. You be empathetic and in terms off a family emergency, you express your sympathy. Uh, so you my experience, I would discuss this privately and personally with this sailor and ah, number of support personnel that are available whether that be a chapel in the dark that's onboard the Corbin. It's on board and with the maybe the eggs or the CEO if they're available. But just realize and understand the situation like this, you do not have to go about this alone. You want there by yourself to do or conduct a this type of thing by yourself in terms off almost impossible assignment That depends on your team in your relationship with that team and how you, uh, have conducted like prior situations, too. So getting with your so you're leading chief petty officer or your your chief petty officer leaving lpo and just sitting down with your team members and discussing what's what's about to take place"
,,jd_thomas,Why do people leave the Navy?,"Okay, So the reason behind people, even in the Navy, it kind of depends on the person. You have to look at a number off different things while they came in. Where they in the Navy for a short period of time. What were there goes about being into the Navy from my experience. Some people, just the neighbors, just not a good fit for"
,,jd_thomas,How can I work smarter?,"I think that's the $1,000,000 question of how do I work? Smarter, Not harder. Right. So Right. So how do you work? Smarter. You work smarter by being more efficient. You be more efficient by managing the time. Managing resource is so getting together. But prior to the start of each day and my planning out your date, right? Not your tasks and your obligations of what needs to take place. Planning also reduces our workload. So plan ahead mended and organize your time manager time."
,,jd_thomas,What else do I need to know?,"I would say the first thing is, in the military and the Navy, you can almost assume that there is an instruction for everything. So if you have a question about something, ask the question. Is there an instruction for If you're not sure about something, try to find an instruction for two. If you don't know something, ask if you're not sure. Ask if you think you know, but you're not sure if you're 100% ask another thing. Communicate. If you want to do something, communicate. Ask him one. Talk to someone about it. Talk to your chief about it. I talked to your 1st 1st 1st class about it. Talk to your department head about it. There's no problem with communicating an issue or something that you may think of is an issue but might not be an issue. But the problem is that the thing is, is that you brought it up. You ask the question. You talked about it. You communicate about, um, another thing. And this comes with a personal life is a balance. Find that balance off home life and work life. The navy is a lot to a lot of people But once you leave the Navy, if you ever leave the Navy, the Navy's going to keep going without you. So make sure that you find the balance of your personal life as well as your work life."
,,jd_thomas,How long does it take to complete your training for OOD (officer of the deck) underway?,"to complete O. D. Under way. Training on that depends largely on the ship's schedule in the at sea time that you're you're ableto you know, to get as a junior officer, um, it can take anywhere from, you know, six toe 12 months. But that depends largely on your work ethic, your opportunities for training and the ship's schedule. But the idea of going into this is to for you to be hungry, and that is to take advantage of every training opportunity that that you're given."
,,jd_thomas,What advice do you have for someone trying to complete training like OOD underway?,"for anyone inspiring to complete oldie underway training. I would first say that it depends heavily on your workout and your time management skills. The second thing work together. There are multiple personnel on board that would be striving for the same qualifications and contrary to properly believe this is not a competition work together. There's a famous saying. Teamwork makes the dream work for you to study together, train together, work together. It will allow you to be Maur of a competent watch stander instead of always thinking and looking over your shoulder, worrying about what this person may have, what that person may have, so work together and use your time wisely."
,,jd_thomas,What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?,"um, I have faced the numerous challenges throughout my career. Um, the first challenge was to balance family and home life with your new career. That's a challenging in itself. The Navy is very demanding, and I like to laugh and joke, you know, with my girlfriend and say, You know, you're the mistress going into this situation and the Navy's my wife So you know, you have to get in where you fit in, but that's somewhat that some way that's true. Eso you as the service member, you have to find that work life balance. On the second challenge. I've gone through some challenges throughout. You know, some of my training. I was a flight school to try, so I went to I was commissioned as a Naval flight officer student initially, so that was a probably the biggest challenge that I faced throughout my career. One word at one piece of advice, I could say to anyone going through Ah, similar challenge would be to look at every opportunity as ah ah, learning lesson and think of the positives, always having a positive attitude and always having a can do attitude, no matter what. So those were probably two biggest challenges off a so far"
,,jd_thomas,What is the most challenging part about your job? ,"the most challenging part about my job would happen. It would probably be the interacting and working with the different personalities. Different backgrounds and the different cultures may sound funny at first, but when you were, you've got 3 403 to 400 people on on this 510 foot, you know, ship for months on end. It's kind of difficult to continue those working relationships when you live, eat and sleep with each other as in sleep next to each other."
,,jd_thomas,Are you married?,"sorry. No, I am not married."
,,jd_thomas,Do you have any kids?,"No, I do not have any kids."
,,jd_thomas,Do you have siblings?,"Yes, I have two brothers on older brother named Marcus, who's a supply officer in the Navy, and I have a younger brother by the name of Michael, who's a field engineer at a nuclear plant."
,,jd_thomas,Do you have any pets?,"No, I do not have any pits, but I do love dogs and I want to go. But the demands of being a swot kind of outweigh my my moral beliefs on what it means to have a pit. I'm not a fan of putting pits and kennels and having him locked up in a house or an apartment. So I'm not in a stable situation where I can allow my dog, you know, like roam free and I can spend, you know, ample time with"
,,jd_thomas,Do you have a significant other?,"up started dating. Um, currently, like tryingto, I guess, you know, iron out the details with someone and narrow down, but she doesn't live here, so that kind of play, it puts a wrinkle in things, especially with the time being on shore duty. You want to spend as much time as you can with the ones that you care about. But we're currently doing trying the long distance thing. She lives back home in the south, and that's Ah, it's kind of a tough day because you only you get to see her every now and then and you get that you have to devote time to talk to her, you know, throughout the day. But being three hours behind it plays ah puts another wrinkle into the situation. So it's kind of tough, but you know, it's working"
,,jd_thomas,How much free time do you have in your career?,"free time. What is that? Uh, but, um uh, it depends on you know, the your ship. Schedule your command schedule as well. As you know, if you're on shore duty or sea duty right now, I'm sure duty student status here in P s. But my workload is very happy. This quarter have 18 hours of credits and which kind of question? About five classes. So here, time management plays probably like the most important role in everything. I do my best to not study on weekends, say, Saturday and Sunday, which means that Monday through Friday, 12 to 14 hours and class, or in the library studying so that I can have Saturday Sunday as free."
,,jd_thomas,How often do you take work home with you?,"I'll do my best to never take my work home with me. I don't study at home. Um, I don't do my best to never, ever, ever, ever, ever take your work home. When you start to bridge that gap between home and work, that's where you lose. Focus off and you lose that balance of home life work life because now you're at home working about worrying about work, and then you'll go to work and you're worried about home. So by not taking my work home, I learned that's like a a big separation, Ah, lining the saying that I don't cross, I'll do my best not to."
,,jd_thomas,Does being a leader give you flexiblity to alter your work schedule?,"in some ways, Yes. And in some ways, no. Um, just a tidbit. You're always subordinate to somewhere you always have a boss. So, uh, in the past, in the past two commands, of course, I worked for a commander and a captain. So your schedule was dictated by the captain. Schedule the Commodore schedule. So if he wanted you at work before he got to work and you had all to your schedule if you didn't mind you going home after your work was done, say, at 2 33 o'clock. Ah, that altered your schedule. So you kind of you're at the mercy of this while you're at the mercy of demands that are placed upon you by by the command and by the schedule."
,,jd_thomas,"How does being a leader change your lifestyle? (frequent travel, irregular hours, family difficulties etc.)","Um, I don't think my lifestyle changed much. I always felt like I was always a leader. So the things that I'm I firmly believe that how you are at home, that's how you are at work or it's it's true for me. How I interact with personnel, singers and subordinates at work is how I am at home. So I'm very personable. I'm a very respectful and very empathetic, So I'll treat you just like I would treat you at home so nothing really changes for."
,,jd_thomas,How do your command responsibilities affect your style in personal life?,"I think it affected tremendously on one side of the coin. Your you have the chance of impacting and command with who you are and how you are as a person. And on the other side of that, that command will impact you in almost the same manner. So you have to consciously, uh, make an effort to incorporate the positive things but resist the negative things. And at the same time, do, uh, do the same with yourself, You know, as far as what you bring. Excuse me to that command. So I think the impact is mutual, you know? But I was actually I remember talking to a guy when I was in college, it was about a fraternity, and I felt a negative way about a certain fraternity. And hey, basically looked at me and said, Hey, you know, you have to build the fraternity around you, you know, don't build yourself around the paternity, and I think that may you know all the difference in the world"
,,jd_thomas,What is a good approach for selecting a new duty station in terms of finding an area for my family to live in?,"um, the biggest and best approach I could say is you have that conversation with your spouse and your family early and often. Um, no one knows the needs off you and your family better than you and your family. So when you're searching for your duty station, you know, you try to find that balance off what the Navy needs and what the Navy wants and what you want and what your family wants for you as faras how to, you know, progress towards the future. So once you develop those four or five things that are important to you go out and you find a duty station in an area within that dude ization that, you know, meet those demands and you basically, you know, express how you feel and what you want. It's simple, Um, but you have to be open to, uh, other or secondary and tertiary options also,"
,,jd_thomas,What are the things I should prioritize when picking housing?,"I think that's a question that I should ask you what? Things are more important, you win picking houses. Um, my personal thing is, um, when it comes to me, I like my own space. I like comfort. I like garages because I like cars. I like to build cars and I like suburbs. So those things make me, you know, happy. Ideally, what you're doing is you're looking for housing as, ah, service member, you're trying to, um, create a positive and productive work positive, productive home life for you, too. Go back to once You've had a stressful day at work. So if you have a long and hard at work, you know, trying to think of the things that you want to have around you when you go home. So that could be, Ah, open concept, single story ranch house with recess lighting. Or it could be a one bedroom studio. Whatever makes you comfortable that you're willing to go home and turn the phones off, turn the TV's off and just be happy being home. So I think about those things when you're looking for housing. Of course, you have to find someplace that's within your budget"
,,jd_thomas,What options do you have to transfer or change if you or your family needs it?,"now that depends on the situation. If it's something said family emergency or, uh, you know, knock on wood. Ah, family member finds out there, or an immediate family member finds out that they're, you know, say, you know, cancer stricken or something. My personal belief is that you express that that need in that issue early and often with your chain of command. And that's to ensure that the commanding officer understands the severity of the event. This highly depends on also the command schedule and the demands placed upon that command and your role within those are those operations. So express that need in that issue early and often. And explorer those options with the command. I have not seen or experienced one command. Try it that does not do their best to work with the service member to ensure that they have time or the capacity to go home and, you know, be with the family member. What do what do you know? Provide as much support as they can? On the other hand, in situations where say, a spouse has opportunity of a lifetime thio take, you know, advantage of a a job opportunity. Um, I hate to say it, but that your spouse is your mistress in reality, and the Navy is your your your husband or your wife at the time, you know. So you it'll probably be best for you and your wife, your your spouse to work. That that situation out, they may have to. You may have to Geo batch While they move. She may, he or she may not be able to take that position is just something that you have to work out with your signature significant other."
,,jd_thomas,"How will my relationship with my friends or family members be affected if I take a difficult assignment, and what advice should I give them?","uh, your your relationship with your significant other your friends family be will be affected tremendously. You there's there may be some information you may not be able to relate to them and in terms of its severity and, uh, what you'll be doing but you it is your responsibility to communicate to them that you know that you are on a difficult assignment and that you may require more support than normal and more patients than normal, and that I would use that as a perfect time to take advantage of expressing your your knee for them as your support system. So, um, but all in all, you'll need them more than their needs."
,,jd_thomas,How early should I get my family involved in the process of planning my next career step?,"early as possible, a soon as you are up for Ah, Slate or you, I would say as soon as you get your first duty station. So as soon as you get there, you should always be thinking about what you want to go next. What do you want to do next? What, What what billets, what options that may be available for you to do next and how it relates to and how it revolves around what you want to accomplish with your family. I'll give you an example, for example, myself, I'd like to be married in a couple of years. I'm pursuing department hit and one day be a CEO. I would like to go back to Jacksonville. That's where I have a rental property. My family's from Georgia, uh, and say Everything goes, is playing and I get married, have kids. I would like my kids, my parents, but in event that I'm shipped off to say, San Diego or Nor ful, or Hawaii or Japan or Spain, that just makes the situation a little bit more difficult to deal with. So coming up with secondary and tertiary options early and often, you know I can better prepare myself and my family and my situation going forward"
,,jd_thomas,What has been your favorite place to live? Why?,"Wow, that's a tough one. Um, my favorite. That's on to two sides. I would say My favorite place to live or favorite places to live would probably be yakuza in Japan and Jacksonville, Florida. I say you cools go because it was a total culture shot and it was just an awesome place to live. You know, you see the different cultures. You see how their customs, how the traditions that they live by just the ease off being a foreigner and living in a different country was just an amazing experience. Also living in Jacksonville, you know, I'm a born and raised Georgia boy, so being a Jacksonville is like being in South Georgia. So I'm the biggest Georgia Bulldog fan there is. So, of course, got to go to the Georgia Florida games. The cocktail party, Um, and it was just awesome being around family and friends while also being able to go to work and, you know, serve the country"
,,jd_thomas,What is an example of a conflict you had between your career and family life? How did you learn from it?,"on example of a conflict between my career and family life with, Ah, probably the I was actually involved in a heavy relationship at one time, and the relationship didn't work out simply because, you know, I had earned my commission, and the my significant other at the time was a E five. So rather than get married on Navy, the Navy's circumstances I chose to the, you know, put it off. And that was probably the biggest, uh, conflict between the military and my personal life."
,,jd_thomas,How do you manage both career and family effectively?,"um, it's kind of kind of goes back to the whole analogy of kind of like the closest allocated to the boat again. Uh, you definitely empathize with your family and you understand who you are to them and what you mean to them and your responsibilities and how you want. Thio. Proceed going forward with your family, but at the same time you have, you know, career obligations. So that's probably like the biggest balancing job that you'll ever do as a person. You know, it's difficult, and it's not easy. One thing I will definitely say, if you don't if you don't remember anything, I see it. Just remember that you're the neighbor will always be there after you're going long after you're going, neighbor, be here. But when you decide to retire, who will be there to support you when you get out of the Navy? That's something for you, too. Definitely think about. You don't want to be standing there by yourself or giving your flag to give me your your certificates and your flags, too, like your mom or something like that, you know, so keep that in mind when your balance in home life and work"
,,jd_thomas,What should I get ready to live overseas?,"If you do an event that you're given an opportunity to live overseas, I would say, uh, short answer everything. Get everything. Really? Um, I'm not sure what you what that encompasses for you. For me, it was a total total life changer. Ah, lot of people don't bring their cars over there, so you need to have to decide to sell your car or, you know, leave it with someone so that they could maintain it. Some people have properties. Eso You have to decide whether to sell that property or put it up for rent, which means you have to find a property manager or find someone to help take care of it. Your phone changes because you're on totally different networks than you are from being over here in the U. S. As opposed to being in Spain or Japan. Everything everything is gonna change. Um, but that's something that, you know, You sit down with your command leadership and you dig into these things and say, Hey, you know, try to answer the questions before the ass, even family wise, what are the living options for a spouse, for your spouse and for your Children in Japan or in your cool school, you know, at least sailors with dependence that were required to live on on base. So, you know, a lot of people, you know had their Children in school and their families lived in on base with him. So those are things that you have to ask yourself. Ask the question before four gets asked, and sometimes, unfortunately, things fall between the cracks because no one thought about it. But it's up to you as the service member to do that."
,,jd_thomas,What resources should I look for when I know I am moving to a location?,"So you're moving to a new location or say a new command. First thing you should do is reach out to your sponsor. Typically, commands will sign a sponsor to you because you're a new addition to the command. And that person will be, you know, similar in rain age. Or, you know, something similar to what you have and what you are. Excuse me. So reach out to that sponsor. If you haven't gotten a sponsor, reach out to the command 99% of time. Each command has a website, uh, thio get in touch with and that command typically probably four or five months or maybe even further out. Maybe about a year before you're due to arrive, they'll send out a welcome aboard package, which includes names, sponsor name, phone numbers, command information, email addresses and things of that nature. It will also allow you to get in touch with, say, the command on Budge Mint, which is typically a navy, a spouse of someone in the command who's in charge of helping your family get acclimated to the new area and you'll reach out through your sponsor. And through that welcome aboard package, you'll be able to find schools, living areas, housing opportunities, Religious service is just about any and everything that you may need that those personnel will be able to help you out. Another resource would be the command CMC on the CMC, which is the command master chief. So he or she will always have a plethora of resource is toe help you get acclimated to the new command and the new area."
,,jd_thomas,What kind of things may fall between the cracks when moving?,"things that fall through the cracks, typically or from my experience, were cellphone plans for getting a council. You know, Horizon T Mobile, Sprint, that thing. Car insurance. A lot of people don't counsel the car insurance. Uh, service is homeservices, like, you know, electric water, cable bills and things. Things of that nature. And also just being, you know, I would say to prevent things from falling through the cracks. I think about the things that you do daily and how it may change when you transfer. Uh, and just think simple. Thanks. Simple. And just think about the basics, like what changes and that will help you to ah, um, prevent things from falling Democratics."
,,jd_thomas,What should I get ready before I deploy?,"before you deploy, you should get into mine. Said you're downsizing. So, um, think about having a say, a two bedroom apartment full of items. And now you're being limited to a two foot lockers and a B. What things do you absolutely need that you can't live without for the next nine months? Ah, a lot of people decided to bring, you know, say three or four sets off. You know, liberty close, um, gym clothes for working out because you still have to stay in some some sort of shape. Ah, a lot of people get care or have a room for care packages safer, like protein peanut butter. You know the little things that you can sit and eat in Iraq when you're like going to your happy place at in today. I like Reese's cups. You know, I don't eat him too often, but you know, things like that definitely say a laptop, Um, your phone, which you know, you keep on WiFi and, you know, watch movies in your spare time. Um, and just things that you like. I said, you don't extras of toiletries and things that she just can't live without, but my big thing is uniforms liberty closed, um, things to do in my spare time that I, you know, enjoy doing. I am, you know, little snacks and things of that nature."
,,jd_thomas,How do you stay in touch with family?,"Wow, that's that's kind of a easy one on. Nowadays, with the advances in technology, it's kind of easy. Typically, every ship you know has or every command has computers available for you to, you know, do work with an access S O. You know, whenever you have time, you know, just get on and get on the say, facebook for a few minutes, we'll get onto your email and your family have, like, a ship email and you get email, you know, every so often or, you know, whenever you have time to email your family, face a Facebook, your family if it's allowed. Also, sometimes the ships have phones. I think like carriers have phones that you can you still use calling cars and call home. Um, but typically, I would keep in touch with my family and friends and significant others through e mail while we're out to sea. And once you pull into port just like the rest of the ship, you will be searching for WiFi and trying to log on so that you can call home and call your mom and call you your girl or your boy. Uh, you know, whatever that may be. So"
,,jd_thomas,How do you ensure your family is taken care of when you are away?,"to ensure that your your family's taken care of it. It's all about planning and thinking, thinking ahead. Eso you think about the things that you typically do day in and day out that will not be done if you aren't there. So, uh, I personally I'm a big fan of, say, auto pay. So a lot of the house bills, especially being a single guy. So my bills are on auto pay, which allow them to be paid. They want some more and it just come out regularly. So it was really just me not being there. Is the difference as far as your family? Definitely the communication needs to be. It needs to be had early and often about Hey, who's gonna do this or who's going to do that? Try to get down the schedule of say what your spouse and say, Hey, you know, here's when the oil needs to be changed in the truck or hears when I typically take out the trash. Or here's when I typically do this on also offer. Resource is for that person to reach out to for assistance if they need, you know the arm Bussmann as faras the command. Other spouses around the command that are are being left as well. Because you're not alone. You're not going out to sea by yourself. So reach out to the other wives or, say husbands that are home and who have more experience than you do when dealing with things like that, and they'll give you other opportunities. And resource is for you to reach out. Um, say, if you're having, like, trouble picking up the keys from school or something like that, So those things that I typically think about"
,,jd_thomas,What is the best plan for if your family has an emergency and you are away?,"the best plan to reach to be able to reach you if your family has an emergency, is was one threw off the whatever hospital or clinic that they're at? Tell them. Make sure that your family tells the service providers that the doctors that hey, I have a service member who is the save the patients Mom, Dad, brother, sister. And they're currently out to sea and give them the vessel name. And typical basically the duty station where they're they're they're leaving from, say, the U. S s. You know, whatever out off San Diego, California and this part and give them your name and they'll be able to reach you through the rail. Red Cross message. Um, if they aren't they can't reach you that way. They could probably email you, which, in my opinion, I don't think that's the best method. But reach out the Red Cross and the Red Cross message will reach the the commanding officer and you'll be notified that way and you'll be able thio between you and the command, you'll be able to make arrangements for you to, uh, developed some kind of plan for you. Thio possibly get home if you need to"
,,jd_thomas,"What is military vacation like? (length, accural rate, types of leave, etc.)","military vacation is heavily dependent on your duty station, and you do the status. Typically a seagoing vessel. Say I give you a DDG, for example. They're too normal. Two big stand down periods, and that's one during the summer and one during, say, Christmas New Year's. You typically be allowed thio. Take extensive vacations. You know anywhere from no leave at all. If you don't want to O r thio say about two weeks, and you can you know ahead of time whether you will be allowed to take leave depending on the ship's schedule, of course, and you can take about two weeks and typically leave is approved, you know well, ahead of time out say anywhere from to four weeks or 2 to 6 weeks ahead of time, given when the requirements or sit and, uh, you'll be allowed to go aware of or whenever do whatever you need to use long as you meet the training requirements and you express your you're want to go on vacation in a certain area ahead of time. It's all about planning, to be honest, but if you're in a say a student status like I am here MPs, um that's a little different. We typically get to take leave periods during long breaks or in extreme circumstances, you know, whenever we don't have class, so we're even during class if it's an emergency."
,,jd_thomas,What is the best way to be happy with your time in the service?,"best way to be happy with your time. The service is to again you think positive do right by people and stay true to yourself. Those are probably the three things I live by day in and day out. And you know, I can't be. I can be more happy, but, you know, I'd say I'm pretty happy also to playing early plan early and often working hard and doing what you're supposed to do and doing doing right. Uh, you typically get what you you request Thio as faras duty stations, for the most part. So, you know, those are probably the three biggest things I can think."
,,jd_thomas,What habits from military leadership are helpful or problematic?,"in terms of dealing with family, I'll say the leadership that empathizes the most and who also have families are probably They have probably the best habits because we, you know, to me, in my opinion, if you have a married CEO, the CEO has a CEO, if you know what I mean. You know? So he or she has to get home and, you know, balance that they have to balance that work, life, work, home life, um, balance. Just like you do. So if the demands aren't too high up on the ship, say, for example, an inside of inspection or, ah, light off inspection or something like that where it's not too demanding, too crazy, you know, coming up then typically, Thea Ciro will allow more time for the sailors to spend with their families."
,,jd_thomas,What is the biggest failure you ever had and what did you learn from it?,"the biggest failure that I've ever had would probably be being kicked out of flight school as an answer. It definitely made me feel the lowest of the low. I felt like a total loser, and that life was pretty much coming to an end. I felt like I left my family that I let my family down, my friends down my community down. But most of all, I let myself down. But that was a learning lesson and it helped me to build a strong relationship with God. You know, because once you're in a situation like that, when you feel like you're losing everything, you go back to what you know, and that's you know, Hey, I need to talk to somebody and that somebody was got for me And he definitely taught me to be a more positive person to always look at the bright side to always look at the positive things in life and in people. And it also prompted me to become ah, surface warfare officer, and I felt like that was like the biggest and best thing for me, you know, possible being a swot is amazing. The leadership opportunities that I get day in and day out from appear standpoint from ah, subordinate standpoint and even as a division officer and you know, someday soon the department here, the leadership opportunities among diverse and you know, different backgrounds that you're able to interact with every day. It's just endless, and you know, it just your toolbox just constantly feels up with tools and Maur things to learn and more things to do, and it's amazing."
,,jd_thomas,What are the failures for which you are the most unhappy?,"the failures that I think that makes me the most unhappy would probably be personal failures, as in failed relationships with friends. Failed relationships with, you know, say girlfriends and even professionally, were things that I feel as a person that I could have done better at managing those situations, you know, being more positive, being more helpful, being less selfish and more selfless. Those are the things that I think about, day in and day out, and but on a positive note, they helped me to build better relationships going forward."
,,jd_thomas,How accepting of failure is this work environment when a good and honest effort was made?,"I think these small communities very accepting a failure effort is just about everything. Um, as a joo as a person. If you're striving to, you know, do better. You're doing all the right things, but you're coming up short. There will always be someone senior, some Pierre, even subordinates that are there to support you and help you get through in your deal."
,,jd_thomas,What are sources of support when you took a chance and the result was poor?,"sources of support. It depends on where you're in and the situation I was. First say your senior enlisted the chief's Massachusetts. The Senior Chiefs are always there to help you get through whatever you need. Thio. It might be a little wall with, but I think that 1999% of time they give you some some good and positive advice, especially if you're you're genuine and honest with. You know, your efforts your department is your department has always there to support you. They might not have as much time as you would like to devote to your issue, but they're always there to help. And of course, Your Excellency, I have not the experience one x or seo that that doesn't have the quote. Time to sit and help you with an issue, whether through directly through themselves, o. R. Or through some other resource"
,,jd_thomas,"How does someone recover from a professional ""bump in the road""?","um, how does someone recover to failure or bump in a row? It's It's simple, It's It's kind of like football. It's a lot like football running backs. They're always talked to keep your legs moving. If you get into a tough spot, cluster ball as tight as you can, which in this situation would be the goal that you're trying to obtain. Put your head down and just keep your legs moving. So I say that as an analogy to say, Hey, if you run into a bump in the road, always keep your golden mind. Embrace it and just keep working towards that. Go. Keep pushing. Keep pushing. Keep pushing that never give up. If you give up. That's when the answer becomes no, that's the moment that you give up on you. Drop the ball or you stop moving your legs. That's when the answer becomes no, and you feel so Just keep going. Keep moving. It might. You might not go in the right direction, but go 100 miles an hour in one direction or somewhere. But just keep your legs moving and just embrace your goal. What you're trying to obtain and just keep"
,,jd_thomas,What was a pivotal moment in your career/life?,"There were several several private moments. I would say the first would be my decision to join the military. That was probably the biggest pivotal moment out of them all. I had, ah, decent situation back home of a new spy ring career and possible chance at medical school. Um, but I felt like the world was too big and there was more of it to see than to be time to, you know, kind of confined myself to one area at that time. So that decision to leave helps of the Georgia to join the world's greatest Navy was probably the biggest, most pivotal point in my life."
,,jd_thomas,What's the biggest risk you've taken in your career?,"Wow, that's a That's a That's a tough one. Um, as a swot, you take risks every day, and I've had thio make risky decisions. Like I said, just about two or three times a day, there was some issue that involved me taking a risk either on a sailor or on a program or just operating ship. The big thing here is toe not kill anyone and not break anything. Um, and also understand that you have resource is available, that you're not alone. Uh, and I think that was like the big three. But you take risks every day, and one in particular would be personnel issues. Um, there was, Ah, one time there was a ah junior sailor that was going through some problems with a junior officer and Julie Officer was actually making advances toward the junior sailor. And I was approached by the junior sailor and told the situation, and I thought it was my best judgment was to Hamlet at the lowest level, which was with me and informing my immediate supervisor, which was a second tour division officer. So I proceeded to counsel the junior officer who was a little bit ahead of me at the time, and I formed my second tour, Devo and, um for while the issue was solved until the advances kept happening and I ended up bringing it up to a department head and after department had gotten got window after I told that department it about it, that Seo was informed. But because of my prior knowledge to the situation, I received a letter reprimand simply because I had known about the situation for some time. So that was you could say, I was a bad judgment on my end, but I was one of the risks I took. You know, as you want to be a good leader, want to be able to handle a situation at the lowest level, so"
,,jd_thomas,What is the most dangerous thing you've ever done on the job?,"the most dangerous thing I've ever done on the job. Waas probably boat ops. As a boat officer, we had to transfer probably about 10 sailors from our DDG to a, um, a transport ship, which was, uh I can't remember exactly what type of ship it was, but it was like it was almost like a like I am messy run ship. So we had We had Thio transport about 10 sailors from one ship to the next, and it was kind of like some some choppy water, so the seas were probably 45 foot seas, so the boat was going up and down. You know, you're trying to get these people on and off the ship, and, you know, it was kind of nerve racking at the time. So as a boto, I was very concerned about the safety of the crew members who were on the boat more so than myself. So and also with, you know, the ddg trailing, you know, kind of offset. It was just a concerned about someone going in the water and, uh, having to, you know, worst case scenario, having informed someone's parents that their son or daughter is not coming home, so that's probably the most dangerous and the most scary. You know,"
,,jd_thomas,What causes the most stress in your job?,"the things that cause the most stress on the job would probably be deadlines. And your other personnel. Everyone has a a deadline to me. And you have this enter, You know, this tangled web of deadlines and schedules and needs of and priorities, So that definitely heightens thes stress level, you know, tremendously. So you may have to inspections coming up next week. You might have a person of some sailors that have just gotten in trouble. So you're down some team leads. You might have, you know, some spot checks coming up, you know, maintenance coming up, and you're about to get underway next week. So those deadlines that compiled on top of each other, definitely hiding stress And you know, not to mention your your home life, Your wife sick or your baby's sick. Your wife stressed out because you're leaving, you know, deadlines. And you know, the multiple lives that you live as. This will probably be the most stressful"
,,jd_thomas,How do you deal with stress on the job?,"two things that I always do or more than 21 thing is, you know, problems always work themselves out. S O You definitely do what you can with what you have when you can. Um, I like the whole notion or the analogy. You handle the closest alligator to the boat. So if you don't know that saying, just think about you being in AA AA Little dingy with five or six alligators come into the boat, you only having Or which one of you gonna swing at first, you know, to keep you in the boat and the alligators out of boat. Um, another thing is always be always to stay positive and time management time management's another thing where you might be able to do a little bit here and there on each task, but eventually they all get done. And lastly, um, I use this a lot, and I till and I talked to when I talked to sailors and my peers a lot is find a happy place. You're the most stressful, and you feel like you're about to break down. Remember that one place in the world that you would rather be and with one person that you would rather be with and go there in your mind for about five minutes. And once you do that, just take a deep breath. I think about the conversations you and that person may have and how it makes you feel, you know, makes you feel stronger, makes you feel better. And then, after those few minutes of meditating, come back home and do what you need to do."
,,jd_thomas,What is a trick that you use to keep stress from boiling over?,"keep stressed from boarding over. Probably my favorite tip that I always give would probably be to go to your happy place. Um, everyone has that one place in mind that they rather be on with that person that they rather be with or people. And I always tell people to go to your happy place in your mind. So when you're about to blow when you're about to lose it, when you feel like the stress is just becoming too much, just stop and take about maybe about 30 seconds to a minute and just go to your happy place and think about how you feel at that moment when you're in your happy place and who you're with and the conversations they you may have with that person, too. Help you deal with, You know, tough times. I always use the example of Superman when Superman is dealing with the worst case scenario. You know, aliens about take over the world or someone's about to blow the world up, and he's at the lowest at the low of his Lois. He always goes home to mind pocket down in Kansas and they build him back up, give him the strength he needs to do whatever he needs to do"
,,jd_thomas,How do you handle self doubt?,"I handle self doubt by simply being positive. Positive thinking leads to a positive belief which leads to positive actions and also, uh, preparing ahead of time."
,,jd_thomas,How do you handle fatigue at work?,"uh, I think that depends on the situation. Being out to sea is a different monster. Um, so being out to sea Helen fatigue, it is Ah, very difficult. But the small communities making a lot of advances in terms of an implement. These circadian rhythm which allows you to have better and normal sleep cycles which are allow you to combat fatigue. So during, like, you know, certain time for you're not getting enough sleep. Ah, I try to hinder my fatigued by getting in a catnap, hearing that here and there or you're trying to work out to kind of lift my spirits."
,,jd_thomas,How do you ensure that boring work gets done well?,"How do I sure that board work gets done will. Basically, um, it's all about attention to detail whenever you're doing a job or a task. Just remember that your name is tired to that. And how do you want your name to be represented by the work that you've done so? Pay attention to detail board work. If it takes longer than, say, an hour or maybe even 30 minutes every so often, take a break. Relax your eyes. Stand up, stretch refocused. Take a walk around the ship, Come back, you know, refocus your eyes and pick up where you left off."
,,jd_thomas,How do you deal with an increase in operations tempo?,"on increase in operational tempo is it's a tough one. For my first ever tour, I was on the USS lasting out in yakuza. Good opinion. And the operational tempo there was, like, something that I've never experienced before. It was definitely monster. Uh, s O. I would handle operations tempo just simply by, you know, adapting my lifestyle around what needed to be done at work and but also finding some work life balance. I'm kind of a home body, so I would get off work late in the evening. And, of course, you know, the things that I enjoy watching on TV, we're coming out early in the morning, which were like football. So I would still make sure I got in, say, two or three hours to watch some sports center to sit at home and cook some chicken wings and, you know, being my happy place and just sit and watch TV for a couple hours. But that that little bit of time, you know, will allow you to I kind of feel your gas tank back up and get ready for the next"
,,jd_thomas,What are common crimes people in your field commit that need to be watched for?,"common crimes that I see people commit. Or, um, I believe people commit will be one would be gun decade gun deck in maintenance, gun deck and qualls. Uh, two, um, interpersonal relationships mocks, you know, sailors and peers subordinates on and off. For one, I think, you know, that stuff is kind of human nature. I mean, you have men and women on board this little 510 foot ship for months on end, so it's only natural for people to be become attracted to each other. But as professionals, you know, I think that's something that we have to, you know, kind of, you know, avoid."
,,jd_thomas,What part of your future are you most worried about?,"the part of my future that I'm most worried about, Um is not so much professional, Small, personal, aspired to be a husband and a father one day. And I think living up to the standards that I set for myself, as well as those standards that were set by that are still being set by my father and that were set by my grandfather, it's probably has has me the most worried about living up to what it means to be a good husband and a good father."
,,jd_thomas,What worries do you have about your professional future?,"what part of my professional career am I worried about? Uh, honestly, None of it. Um uh, go out every day. I work hard. I do my best to do the right thing and treat people right and put the rest of gods. And, um, you worrying about something that, you know, four years from now, eight years from now, 10 20 years from now? It doesn't help you at all. That just only adds more stress onto already. Ah, full plate of stress. So my advice to you would be too. Don't worry about what's to come if you do what's right if you do what's right now and you work hard, you do right by people. Uh, everything will work out."
,,jd_thomas,"If you could change one thing about your job, what would it be?","one thing I would change about my job would probably be, um that would probably be the thief. Amount of stress that you have to deal with day in, day out. Um, I think it it weighs on, uh, everyone. I know it's different for everyone, but I just think the amount of stress that you have to deal with it causes, huh? I guess you could say unwarranted consequences. You know, things like high blood pressure, things like, you know, uh, sleep anxiety, you know, issues that, um, the average person would want a deal well with and shouldn't have to deal with. And I think some of these effects are felt by, you know, a lot of our leaders long after they retire."
,,jd_thomas,What used to be your biggest weaknesses?,"um, my biggest weakness used to be wearing my emotions on my sleeve. I'm very I'm a very personable person. I'm a very, uh, caring, empathetic person. So it was easy for someone to learned how to push my buds. Eso saying certain things, doing certain names that they knew would agitate me or get me fired up. Then it was easy to figure that out. So wearing my emotions on my sleeve was probably the biggest weakness I my Achilles heel."
,,jd_thomas,Describe a time that you were put into an untenable ethical situation?,"um, one situation comes to mind when I think about unethical decision. I had to make that stem from U. S s far ship where there was a, um, a young enlisted, you know, sailor who had come to me one day and told me about a situation. She was being approached by one of the one of my fellow duty officers. And hey was making advances on and, uh, she expressed the ah, you know, her her feelings, that she didn't want the advances and that she didn't want him to get in trouble and that he hadn't touched or anything. He was just pushing up on her and I had done it a few times, and she wanted to bring it to someone's attention. But he didn't want you. She didn't want to get him in trouble. So I told her I talked to him and I wanted her to keep me in the loop. If something were to happen because, you know, I would take it up the chain of command. So, um, I don't calling him on the ship phone one day and asked him to come talk to me and s o he proceeded to do so. And you know, I told him, you know what I had been told and that he shouldn't do, you know, you know, proceed any further, you know, to stop it here. And ah, he kind agreed to it and known associate. Kind of agreed to it s o. I informed my immediate supervisor. And, you know, we just kind of moved on from there. Well, he proceeded. Thio continued advances and, you know, I ended up taking it up the chain of command and sometime later, but the time between I me initially knowing about it and between me take it up to command had been about two months, So I ended up getting in a little trouble behind it and looking back of I don't know if I would handle it any differently because I felt like I was doing the right thing by handled it the situation at the lowest level. Ah. Then on the other hand, I would say that it was a situation where I should have just taken it up the chain of command immediately, you know, So it's kind of like a battle with that, even today"
,,jd_thomas,How do I deal with an assignment that I don't like or that isn't a good fit?,"before I answer that, I would like to ask you a question. Um, if we're going to war time and say certain casualties happened on the ship, would that be something that you would like or something that you wouldn't be a good fit for? The idea behind being placed on an assignment, that you don't like it and that you may not be a good fit just to see how you adapt to situations where you're not comfortable. So, uh, the entire community, the small community, is about being uncomfortable. You're going to just about every bill, it not knowing what you're doing or how to do it sometimes. So I would say go into this assignment. This billet with a positive attitude and a can do attitude and being able to use your resource is wise and so think positive, get to know the people understand the situation and solve problems. That's what you're there to do. So the idea is to learn something, find more tools and develop more twos to put in your toolbox so that you could one day be a leader or a great leader in this world's greatest navy"
,,jd_thomas,What things are there for me to do on a ship?,"Oh, wow. Um, so as a junior officer on board a new ship, the first thing that you're going to do is work. Uh, you're gonna work a lot. You're going to eat you asleep, and you're probably gonna work some more. Uh, the thing here is, uh, to find time in between work, eating and sleeping to obtain your calls and devote, you know, say 1/10 of that time every day to some sort of leisure toe where you can stay sane. Uh, it's humanly possible to, you know, we're even sleep, but everyone needs some downtime to, you know, to be able to function that at a decent capacity."
,,jd_thomas,Where have you been in port?,"So I've been all over the world. I've been to Marseilles, France. I've been to Dubai. I've been to Bahrain. I've been to, of course, you Kuska SaiPan's Brunei, Singapore, Philippines. Uh, Hawaii, San Diego, Mexico, Chile, Peru, Argentina, Colombia, Nicaragua. Um, and that's all I can outside a Florida, uh, Norfolk, Rhode Island. I think that's about it. That's all I can think of right now."
,,jd_thomas,Where were you stationed and what was it like there?,"All right. So I've been stationed at your crews. Could Japan in Jacksonville, Florida and now Monterey, California You kuska eyes just just like his advertised on TV. Japan is awesome. Place you. Cooper's about our half south on the train from Tokyo. So it has everything city, life, suburb, life. Even like country life, there was always something to do somewhere to go. But the thing there was having the time to do it because of the operation or demands placed on the Siegel investors. So I was amazing experience I've been to all over Tokyo, and I was just amazing. I even had a tattoo done in Tokyo on New Year's Eve. It's just if you get the chance to go out there and experience that, I definitely go. Jacksonville, um, is a lot like South Florida, South Georgia. I'm from Georgia, so it's just like going home. It was another amazing experience, definitely somewhere where I personally would like to settle down. Ah, on the simple fact of cost of living close to home closeness to home and just a the simple life, you know, the simple things, um, I was also had did some time in San Diego as far as training Uh, San Diego was to me is for like, young single couples or young single people who like to live and go and just have fun. San Diego's more expensive, Um, but there's a lot to do in a lot of things to see. And it's our closeness toe L. A. In Mexico, and, you know, you know you can go just about anywhere on the West Coast coming out of San Diego."
,,jd_thomas,What things should I prioritize when moving to a new location?,"so the things that you could prioritize first be what's important to you and what's important to your family. Those things are will make the difference in, ah, great duty station. Um, as far as like where you're going and what you'll be able to do, what you do in your off time. The second thing is your job and your plant the platform that you're aspiring to go to, Um, I enjoy Didi G's s Oh, my preference would be like a ddg out of same Mayport. Um, and third would probably be the job. Like I mentioned before, I personally think that slows. You know, you can do whatever job that's, you know that you're assigned to you, confined their strengths and weaknesses within these job and, you know, do it to the best of your ability. But of course, certain jobs are more demanding than others. And certain aspects say, for example, a chain of isil whips, you know, chain was responsible for the entire plant of proportion plant and, you know, some auxiliary, a lot of the auxiliary plants that actually run the ship so you know you'll be your job is a lot more demanding um so those things out prioritize would be You know what's more important to you as faras your location a SZ far as you do the station. And that's important to your family and platform that you will be working out of a DDG as opposed to a cruiser or an Anthea and what job you aspire to do."
,,jd_thomas,When do you get to choose if you are going to live in post or off post? ,"So, as a junior officer, you'll be given that opportunity to live off base as soon as you start your career. Once you arrive at your permanent duty station, you'll be allowed to live off base. Um, and that's through your basic housing allowance. Um, in the military, though altogether sailors who are E four in over four years allowed to live off base and or if they have, they are married with dependence. So if you are a married before you're allowed to, I have, uh, be eight or a lot of live off base. If you are E four and under four years and you do not have dependents, then you will be required to live on base. That's given the base command or the shore command. There has ample room thio accommodate. You know enough sailors"
,,jd_thomas,When do you need to find your own housing?,"uh, you should find your own housing as soon as you arrive or at your apartment in duty station or whale before it's kind of tough to do that when you first arrived to a uh on your PCs, especially if it's kokonas. But if you're a calmness, you'll typically know ahead of time where you'll be stationed at where you're going, and you can reach out through the to the command through the welcome Aboard package and find the decent areas for you to live in. Or, um, just wait until you arrive and you're giving, um, I think it's 10 days to find housing today's house. Huntley, where you get you have about two weeks for you to go out and find living arrangements."
,,jd_thomas,When should I own or rent?,"That's a perfect question. I'm actually happy to answer that. You know, my whole notion is you should by when you're comfortable, because this is something this is an investment that you'll have to live with for the rest of your life. Um, if you have the means to by home, I think you should do so. But that's also taking into consideration your personal finances as well as the situation within the housing market. Um, I purchased my first house about three years ago. Almost. I was, what, 29. So about my thing was, I didn't have the money saved up until I was 29 to purchase the house, but also took him to consideration. You know, my follow on duty stations. Would I be stationed back in Jacksonville? Will I be chances of me being stationed in San Diego or no phone are greater than Jacksonville. And you don't plan on going back to Jacksonville? Why buy a house in Jackson s O? These are things that you have to take into consideration when you decide to buy a house or when you decide to rent. Um, I've had this conversation with a few of my buddies who are more senior and are on the back end of their career. And some of have never own houses. And some are in the market to purchase houses simply because it's there finishing their career. And they, their families are there looking to settle down in one place and stay in one place. So it kind of depends on what you want to do as a person. Do you want to have investment rental properties, or do you want to rent until you decide to retire? It's solely up to you. But, uh, hi person would use the resources that are available to me when it comes to decided to buy a home. So each base has a, uh, like a fleeting family support centers where they give housing, um, housing classes to help you give you help. You make amore informer former the decision When it comes to buying houses. Also, your CMC, your senior senior leadership, I'm not almost 90% sure that your seal XO has a home or owns the home or on several homes, so use the resource is within your command as well as outside. Thio help you make that decision"
,,jd_thomas,What types of services are easy to find vs. hard to find on a Navy base?,"So when it comes to, ah, service is in and around the base for, I don't know, maybe barbershops. Laundry service is there's always something available. Every command or every naval station has, like a next of mini nicks and that typically has a number of restaurants, a barbershop, dry cleaners for uniforms. Ah, a grocery store Comets area somewhere for you to go shopping. Just think about it. You're not the first person to obtain a commission and be stationed in a new duty station. So the community typically responds to the military when they're something along the lines off a army base, a naval station, even like a schoolhouse or something like that. So outside of bass and around base, you can basically find all the things that you you need thio, you know, to meet you bait the basic human needs, your barber shops, grocery stores. Um, um, your bar and grill's your restaurants on. There's always somewhere you know, for you to find what you need. You just have to be willing to step outside of bass and right around ask questions. You know, talk to people and typically your, uh, shipmates in your sailors already have the process down. You just got to ask him to know where to go and who to go see to get what you need."
,,jd_thomas,How often will I have to move?,"So, um, as a officer in the United States Navy, you could be expected to move every 2 to 3 years. I've been in the Navy about nine years going on 10 years now, and I've probably moved every one and 1/2 to about two years. Of course, some of my circumstances are a little different, but I've moved about every two years, and you can somewhat of expect the same. Your first to devote tours are about two years each. And unless you fleet up, you have probably spend your first tour in one place, and you're second to another place. After your second tour, you'll go to shore duty chases. Are you want to spend that somewhere else, Or you will go to earn, say, ah, master's degree or something. So that means you move again after you finish your duty. You could be expected to go to department here school, which you can bet you're gonna move from that duty station to Rhode Island and then you move again to your department head duty stations, which you have to do to so you two more times. So by the time you reach, say, 10 or 12 years or your second shore duty. You've moved about my 45 times right in, so you can expect to move about every 2 to 3."
,,jd_thomas,"Can you use outside communication on a deployment, like using the internet and email, calling by phone, and writing mail?","the short answer to that is yes. Um, longer answer is it depends on on the situation. Of course, ships are meant to be at sea, and they move a lot. So depending on the requirements of the command and demands for the missions that they're they're set to meet, you may be at what's called River City, which the CEO shuts down all outside communication outside of, uh, mission necessary calms. So your e mails, your Facebooks, all that kind of stuff wouldn't work. Even the phones are shut down, but typically, why you're out to sea and your steam. You have access to email, you may be allowed to get on Facebook, and that's kind of actual seals discretion. And you have phone calls."
,,jd_thomas,Can you drink alcohol when deployed?,"again. Short answer is yes. The longer answer is it Opinions. Um, I want to say there's, ah rule in someone in one of the instructions that basically says that you're a lot. Your CEO is allowed to give you one beer every 44 days at sea, but you can almost guarantee that you will not be at sea for 44 days unless you absolutely have to. So, most of all, boys and most cares will pull in, um, under that 44 4 day limit while you're out steam and definitely not you won't be allowed alcohol. But once your import, it depends on the your CEO's discretion. Chances are you'll be allowed to drink alcohol in the event that no one on the ship or let's say, within a strike group if you're operating within the strike group has had in like, alcohol related incidents. So when you do get to drink, just be on your best behavior and make it watch out for your buddies and to make sure that they're got not getting in any trouble or alcohol related incidents, which will calls you no more problems and people not being able allowed to drink"
,,jd_thomas,What have you seen people spend a bonus on that worked out well?,"so I've seen Ah ah, wide assortment of spending, you know, habits for bonuses. Some people don't spend their bonuses at all. I personally, I don't spend mine. I just kind of let it sit there and I invested or put in a high your savings account. Some people spend it on their homes. Some people use it as down payments for buying homes or some people buy cars. It just kind of depends on you as a person. What you hold dear, Some people go on like these extravagant vacations and kind of burned a portion of it. And, you know, I really know you know what they do with the wrist. But you can expect those kinds of things and my my personal, um, situation. I have a rental running home down in Jacksonville, and I used a portion to upgrade the home built a privacy fence put up from ceiling fans things of that nature to increase the value of my home over. I guess you build more equity in the home as well, so you can use your you could spend your money or make your money work for you. Kind of depends on you. So that's 11 way you can use your money to make it work for you"
,,jd_thomas,What kind of lifestyle can I afford as a junior officer without going into debt?,"my response will be a question that you Are you married? Do you have a girlfriend? Do you have kids? If you have any one of the three, your chances of going to debt are very high. You know, I'm just playing, but, um, I think the key here is to understand what a budget is and how to live within your budget. Um, as a junior officer, you get paid a You get paid a decent amount. Um, but the key is to understand how your life is affected by how much you make a short money lesson is, you know, revenue minus expenses. That's kind of how you kind of you need to kind of frame what you're going by. If you're buildout, we how much you, mate, you're gonna go into debt. So the idea is to find living arrangements. Fine. Do the obtained the basic necessities to sustain life, which are, you know, shelter, food and clothing and just kind of branch out from there. Do you really need to go out and buy the newest, hottest Mercedes Benz? You probably don't if you have a, you know, functional for transportation For the time being, why go buy a new car. Um, if you do, you have to eat out 56 times a week. Probably not go grocery shopping. Learn how to cook. So learn how to balance that budget and stay and live within your means, and you won't worry about debt."
,,jd_thomas,How do taxes work in the military?,"So is a active duty service member. You still pay income taxes and, um, you pay state taxes depending on what home? A residency that you claim on your Texas. So states like Florida, Texas they don't have state takes state taxes, but you have sales taxes. So say, for example, of Georgia. Georgia has a state income tax of 6%. So because I'm a residency of Florida, don't have to pay state income. Tax is a SW far is, um, pays and bonuses. You do pay taxes on your bonuses, and you pay taxes on your basic income or your income every month. If you are operating in a tax free zone, say, overseas or in a combat zone, you don't pay taxes on any of your your ah allotments. With that being said, a lot of people they'll go and they'll enlist in tax free zones, and that way they get their full bonus. Uh, this is little two bit a SZ faras deductions. You are not allowed to deduct things like haircuts. Um, from what I understand, uniforms mileage on transportation. You can't deduct that those kinds of things, but you can like I say, you're allowed to avoid state taxes by whatever residency you claim measure state"
,,jd_thomas,When do I need to worry about retirement?,"All right, so two things here worry is the wrong word. You should never worry about retirement too. You should always think about retirement. So as soon as you, uh, basically, as soon as you raise your right hand, you should be focused on retirement. You should live your career to retire. So the idea for me is to retire. Excuse me is to retire as an 06 at 25 years. That would give me that would put me out of certain income range and a certain pension range. Also, the Navy has done an awesome job of helping sailors plan for retirement through the first savings playing the TSP. So out of your 1st 4 years, say, within the military or a typical enlistment for Ah, listen, serviceman, you'll be on like a probationary pier where you're, uh, basically, you're given, I think, 5%. After that first year of being in the military, the neighborhood match 5% to your 5% and you can put anywhere up to nothing each year or your entire paycheck or your special pays or your bonuses into this TSP A good rule of thumb for investing into your retirement is 10%. So I would recommend you put in about 10% into your retirement through the TSP monthly and for the start of your career, a CZ you gain income and gain rank and obtained bonuses. I would say, you know, find that financial freedom to balance that you're spending habits and but paying by paint. But paying yourself first through your investments in your TSP. So you should never worry about retirement but should always have it on your mind. So invested in your retirement by using utilizing the TSP and other investments. Such a mutual funds. Rafael Reyes Traditional IRAs, um, certificates of deposits, things that of that nature. So never worry about retirement, but think about it always."
,,jd_thomas,What do I need to do to plan for my family in the event something happens to me? ,"So this one is a tough question to deal with emotionally from it from an emotional standpoint. But here you have to think about you know, things logically, like you're not all. You may not always be there for your family. You were in your war fighter and, you know, war, state place and things do happen. Also, training accidents do happen, and not as frequently as they used to. But, you know, things happen where sometimes sailors don't come home. So you have to play for for the worst, you have to always hope for the best, but plan for the worst, and that being you not come home. So, um, another tidbit for me is to invest in additional life insurance early, early you are, Which kind of correlates to you being in better shape. The younger you are, the lower that you'll pay monthly for additional life insurance. So, of course, the, uh, what's provided for us is I think it's almost 30 bucks. Monthly is the SDO lie, which gives us $400,000 or gives your family $400,000 of life insurance and event. Something happens to you while you're out service But banks like Navy, Federal and USA have life insurance, additional life insurance policies, which are term life insurance policy and whole life insurance policies. Where in the event something happens to you while you're active duty, you can receive up to an additional. Um, I guess, you know, somewhere along the lines of, like, 1/2 a $1,000,000 for, uh, for your family and event, something happens for you to you, Um, with these policies, especially on the USA, because I have two additional with us A a term in the whole life. Uh, what happens is I pay them monthly premium for both life insurance policies. And in the event, something happens to me. My beneficiaries will receive, you know, lump sums of money in addition to the Stu alive. Now, you might ask the question. What happens if I retirement? We're not retired. Do I lose the SD alive? Well, yes, you do. But when you retire with your own life insurance policies, especially through a U. S. A. That money, the money's that you have through this year, lie will roll over and to some of these policies that you get through your say so you, don't you lose that $400,000? So that's something. Another thing for you to think about as a say, a husband or father."
,,jd_thomas,What benefits should I take advantage of more?,"a SZ faras benefit she should take advantage of. Um, I'm a personal fan of the V A loan when it comes to a person in the home that allows you to save a substantial a lot of money when you're buying, say, your first house. Oh, are an investment property. It comes with certain stipulations, but I think it's Ah, definitely an avenue you should venture into or think about when I decided to buy a home. Also, a lot of the credit card companies allow you to obtain credit cards with extensive fees. That's if you are on a if you are responsible enough to handle that responsibility of owning a credit card, which I assume you are because you're a junior officer in the Navy. So I'll give you, for example, and I'm not advocating for anyone cos just one that I used. American Express has a number of credit cards with um, they allow a lot of perks. For example, gold status for these hotel chains of rental car changes. You get like an upgraded member status for just being just owning the car and normally as ah, save typical consumer, you pay about 500 to 600 bucks a year in credit card fees for just having a car. But through the Civil Service Civil Servicemember Relief Act or something, you're allowed to bypass those fees and obtain that car. And though these cars give you a lot of perks and a lot of benefits, so those are just too, that I I used to my advantage by using his credit cards. I'm able to pay off my expenses and on these credit cards and obtained all the points behind them so you can use the points towards flights and hotels, vacations, even like a tournament for, like cash, depending on the situation. So those are just two things that I like to take advantage of."
,,jd_thomas,How is travel paid for?,"um so travel is typically paid through. Uh, I think it's, ah, a couple of different ways. If you're on orders, uh, travel can be paid for by the by the service member or through, um, basically through Millington, who's who actually provides you your orders so they'll send you out saying advance pay where you there Lots of certain amount of money to travel from point A to point B. And the idea is for you to keep my receipts and turning travel claim, uh, showing how you spent those monies for travel. Or if you're on official, like, say, for traveling for an exercise or something and you have a government travel car, you could spend those moneys through using that government travel car in a program called DTs. Which of the defense travel system if I'm not mistaken, so you're going there on every command has a typically like a yeoman or a PS who will show you how to use this program, and you go in there and you create your travel to travel from Point A to point B. Using that government travel card"
,,jd_thomas,What kind of hobbies do you have time for?,"so a cz far as having time for hobby. You will have time depending on your personal situation. So and that depends on your family requirements and your family demands and the demands placed on you by the command. So, me personally, for example, I'm in a student status here in P s. So I have ample time outside of my study and school requirements. I personally like fishing, and I'd like to do things like bowling and working on cars and things of that nature. So that's typically what I do. Go to the beach. I go fishing, work on cars or personal restoration projects, and I go Boldin and traveling. So, uh, short answers. That depends on your personal situation. You know, you'll find time to do the things that you love, given what you have to do."
,,jd_thomas,What types of questions can I ask you about?,"you can ask him about anything. My job as a mentor and as a fellow sailor and service minutes to help where help is needed. So if you have a question about something, please feel free to ask."
,,jd_thomas,What happens if you attrit or a particular officer path doesn't work out?,"in the event of a particular your particular path or within your community does not work out. There are other options. You can lateral transfer on event that you decide a lot off transfer. You put in a little transfer package and transferred to another community. Personnel do it all the time, so it's not something that's uncommon. You could go from swot to HR, which is human resource is. You can lateral transfer thio the information. You can go just about anywhere. Excuse me, but that's up to you to find that information and use the resource is you have available. Your local command career counselor as well as your ex soul would definitely be able to help you explore the options that are available in the event that you're in the program and say you you failed to meet the standards set for that program. You'll have to go up on a redesignation board where you have to submit a package basically stating why you're fit to be in the Navy and what community that you like thio be considered for. I was tried it from the flight school program as an aviator, so I was ah, redesignated officer, basically. So I had to go upon this board where I submitted a package to five separate communities and one community chose me, which was so"
