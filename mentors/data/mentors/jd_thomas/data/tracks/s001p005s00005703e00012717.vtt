00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.870
So in order to set the tone and to find that right tone, I think it's

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.900
 one in the same. You lead by example, um, and you leave with empathy.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.920
 So if you're gonna understand how someone feels understand how it

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.940
 feels to be laid into a situation, you can better leave someone into

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.970
 a situation so lead by example and leading with company empathy will

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.990
 set the tone for just about any situation.
