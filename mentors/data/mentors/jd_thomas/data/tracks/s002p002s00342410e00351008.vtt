00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.960
the core team members out. What's our light on? Would be, um, definitely

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.070
 your chief Petty officer. If you were a division officer, your chief

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.180
 petty officer, your department here and a number of your peers,

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.290
 these will be people that you were basically talked with numerous times

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.390
 throughout the day, and, uh, they will be able to excuse me, cyst

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.500
 you with personal issues. You may be dealing with a professional issues

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.610
 you may be dealing with offer guidance. You may be a bit offer

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.720
 guidance to them. So I would definitely say a department hit and your

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.830
 peers and a chief petty officer.
