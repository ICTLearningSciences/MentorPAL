00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.740
when it comes or an experience that a woman is navy culture I would say

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.630
 it's a it's classic and I'm pretty sure everyone experiences is this

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.510
 is our definitely would have to say returning from a deployment sale

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.400
 more like a genie in the ship after a long peered out at sea so

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.290
 the general excitement among the crew and you know each others it just

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.180
 kind of raises morale because you know you go home you know everyone's

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.070
 kind of walking on like cloud and then it's like the last couple

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.950
 of days and it's almost like a kid going to Disney world for the

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.840
 first time the night before it's like that kid and sleep is just so

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.730
 excited to read to go home you know you just read to see a family and

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.620
 friends and that culture just kinda hits it's peak the day of when

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.510
 everyone is put on the dress whites so the dress blues and we're getting

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.390
 all ready and pressed and everything's nice and you know you finally

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.280
 hear the the manta reels called on the one MC and that's how

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.170
 you know it's like you're going home and I think that that culture kind

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.060
 of hits it hits its peak at that time to where you pull the import

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.950
 and you and all your three hundred of your closest friends are are

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.830
 going home for the first time and you know seven or eight months and

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.720
 I think that just kinda you know that that just sums up like maybe

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.610
 culture right
