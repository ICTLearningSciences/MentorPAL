00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.740
I'm sorry. An experience that illuminates Navy culture. Um, I would say

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.630
 it Sze classic and I'm pretty sure everyone experiences is this is

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.510
 ah definitely would have to say returning from a deployment say on

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.400
 boy like any any ship after a long period out at sea. Uh, so the general

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.290
 excitement among the crew and you know each other's It just kind

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.180
 of raises morale because, you know, you're going home. You know, everyone's

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.070
 kind of walking on like cloud now, like the last couple of

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.950
 days, and it's almost like a kid going to Disney World for the first

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.840
 time the night before. It's like that kid and sleep is just so excited

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.730
 to read to go home. You know, you're just ready to see your family

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.620
 and friends. And that culture just kind of hits its peak the day

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.510
 off when everyone is putting on their dress whites or the dress blues.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.390
 And we're getting already and pressed and everything's nice and,

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.280
 you know, you finally hear the the man the rails called on the one

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.170
 emcee, and that's how you know it's like you're going home. And I think

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.060
 that that culture kind of hits it hits its peak at that time toe

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.950
 where you're putting import and you and all your 300 of your closest

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.830
 friends are going home for the first time in seven or eight months

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.720
 on. And I think that just kind of, you know, that that just sums up

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.610
 like Navy culture, right?
