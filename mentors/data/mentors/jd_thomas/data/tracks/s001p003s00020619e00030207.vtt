00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.150
when I was a kid of there was, like, a just just want to be something

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.450
 that impacted someone in a positive way. Of course, you know, being

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.750
 from the South, you the big thing is playing football. So there was

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.040
 always important to me toe, you know, impress my family and friends

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.340
 by being a star athlete. So I wanted to be ah, linebacker for the Atlanta

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.640
 Falcons or the Ravens emulated Ray Lewis a lot. Um, outside of

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.940
 that, I just kind of want to be a country key, you know, enjoy working

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.240
 on cars and fishing and stuff like that. So whatever I could do

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.540
 that I enjoy helping people. I was gonna make me some money and doing

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.830
 it to take care of my family. You know, just that was happy with that.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.130
 As long as I got to go home to my home at the end of the day and,

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.430
 you know, work on cars and go fishing with my family. That was about

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.730
 it.
