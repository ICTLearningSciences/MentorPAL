00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.560
service sailors with a Negro called problems on TV I'm sure we're all

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.280
 watch SportsCenter and you can tell when certain teams break up because

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.990
 of it's always the same couple of issues a person acting selfishly

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.710
 the person acting you know out because of their ego how to solve

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.420
 this issue again this communication sitting down with that sailor with

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.140
 that team member and trying to figure out what's the issue and how

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.850
 to move forward from there can we solve this issue if we cannot solve

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.570
 this issue how do we how do we remove you from the team but I I

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.280
 honestly use that as a very very last resort there's always a way for

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.000
 and there's always a route to a problem and a way to solve it it's

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.710
 just you have to be willing to sell
