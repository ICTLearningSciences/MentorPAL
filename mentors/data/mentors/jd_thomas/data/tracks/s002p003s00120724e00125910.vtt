00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.560
selfish sailors with an ego cause problems on a team. I'm sure we're all

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.280
 watch SportsCenter, and you can tell when certain teams break up,

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.990
 because it's always the same couple of issues, a person acting selfishly

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.710
 and a person acting, you know, out because of their ego. How Thio

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.420
 solve this issue again. It's communication sitting down with that

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.140
 sailor or that team member and trying to figure out what's the issue

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.850
 and how to move forward from there. Can we solve this issue? If we

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.570
 cannot solve this issue, how do we How do we remove you from the team?

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.280
 But I honestly use that as a very, very last resort. There's always

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.000
 a way for, and there's always a route to a problem and a way to

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.710
 solve it. It's just you have to be run this off
