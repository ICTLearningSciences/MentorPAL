00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.040
so I've seen Ah ah, wide assortment of spending, you know, habits for

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.230
 bonuses. Some people don't spend their bonuses at all. I personally,

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.410
 I don't spend mine. I just kind of let it sit there and I invested

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.600
 or put in a high your savings account. Some people spend it on their

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.790
 homes. Some people use it as down payments for buying homes or some

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.970
 people buy cars. It just kind of depends on you as a person. What you

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.160
 hold dear, Some people go on like these extravagant vacations and

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.350
 kind of burned a portion of it. And, you know, I really know you know

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.540
 what they do with the wrist. But you can expect those kinds of things

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.730
 and my my personal, um, situation. I have a rental running home

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.910
 down in Jacksonville, and I used a portion to upgrade the home built

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.100
 a privacy fence put up from ceiling fans things of that nature to

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.290
 increase the value of my home over. I guess you build more equity in

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.470
 the home as well, so you can use your you could spend your money or

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.660
 make your money work for you. Kind of depends on you. So that's 11

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.850
 way you can use your money to make it work for you
