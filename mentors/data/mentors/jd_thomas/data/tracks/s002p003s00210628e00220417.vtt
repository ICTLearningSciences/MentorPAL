as far as our disagreements between my team members myself I I don't recall

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.370

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.640
 I'm I'm a big fan of this thing called teamwork makes the dream

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.900
 work so and I understand as a leader that I'm not always right and what

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.160
 I always want what I what I am what I feel should be done sometimes

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.420
 there's not what should be done so I don't recall ever having a

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.680
 situation like that I was I'm a big fan of communication a working through

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.940
 a situation using my resources which could be such a subject

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.210

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.470
