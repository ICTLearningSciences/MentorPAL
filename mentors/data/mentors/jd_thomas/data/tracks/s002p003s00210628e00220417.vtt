00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.110
a SZ faras our disagreements between my team members and myself. I don't

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.370
 recall actually having too many, and none really sticks out. Like

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.640
 I said, I'm a big fan of this thing called Teamwork makes the dream

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.900
 work. So and I understand as a leader that I'm not always right and

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.160
 what always want without what I am, what I feel should be done. Sometimes

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.420
 that's not what should be done. So, um, I don't recall ever having

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.680
 a situation like that. I'm a big fan of communication and working

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.940
 through a situation using my resource is which could be subject

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.210
 matter experts in the form of 1/3 class, A second class, maybe even

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.470
 the semen. So, you know, I don't I don't recall ever having a major

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.730
 disagreement. And most teams as faras solvent issue
