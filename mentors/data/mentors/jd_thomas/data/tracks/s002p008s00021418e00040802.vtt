00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.020
all right so I've been station that the you could cause a pan and Jacksonville

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.200
 Florida and now Monterey California you could go is just just

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.370
 like is advertised on TV a Japan is also place it's of but you could

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.550
 cause about our how have south on the a train from Tokyo of so it

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.720
 has everything city life suburb life even like country life phone

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.900
 there was always something to do somewhere to go but the thing there

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.070
 was having the time to do it of because of the operational demands

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.250
 placed on the the seagoing vessels so I was amazed in our experience

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.420
 I've been to all over Tokyo and I was just amazing I even had a tattoo

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.600
 done in Tokyo on new year's eve if you did is just if you you get

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.770
 the chance to go out there and experience it I I that's different

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.940
 say go of Jacksonville arm is a lot like South Florida south Georgia

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.120
 I'm from Georgia so just like going home who is another amazing experience

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.290
 it'll definitely somewhere where I personally would like to

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.470
 settle down all the simple fact of cost of living on close to home closest

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.640
 to home and just the the simple life you know simple things I

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.820
 was also ahead how did some time in San Diego as far as training San

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.990
 Diego is to me is for like young single couples are young single people

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.170
 who like to live and go and just have fun Senegal's more expensive

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.340
 what is a lot to do a lot of things to see and it's our closeness

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.520
 to LA in Mexico and you know you know you can go just about anywhere

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.690
 on the west coast coming out of San Diego
