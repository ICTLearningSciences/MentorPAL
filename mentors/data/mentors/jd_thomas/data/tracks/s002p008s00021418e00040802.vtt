00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.020
All right. So I've been stationed at your crews. Could Japan in Jacksonville,

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.200
 Florida and now Monterey, California You kuska eyes just just

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.370
 like his advertised on TV. Japan is awesome. Place you. Cooper's about

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.550
 our half south on the train from Tokyo. So it has everything city,

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.720
 life, suburb, life. Even like country life, there was always something

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.900
 to do somewhere to go. But the thing there was having the time

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.070
 to do it because of the operation or demands placed on the Siegel

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.250
 investors. So I was amazing experience I've been to all over Tokyo,

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.420
 and I was just amazing. I even had a tattoo done in Tokyo on New Year's

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.600
 Eve. It's just if you get the chance to go out there and experience

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.770
 that, I definitely go. Jacksonville, um, is a lot like South Florida,

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.940
 South Georgia. I'm from Georgia, so it's just like going home.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.120
 It was another amazing experience, definitely somewhere where I personally

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.290
 would like to settle down. Ah, on the simple fact of cost of

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.470
 living close to home closeness to home and just a the simple life,

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.640
 you know, the simple things, um, I was also had did some time in San

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.820
 Diego as far as training Uh, San Diego was to me is for like, young

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.990
 single couples or young single people who like to live and go and just

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.170
 have fun. San Diego's more expensive, Um, but there's a lot to do

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.340
 in a lot of things to see. And it's our closeness toe L. A. In Mexico,

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.520
 and, you know, you know you can go just about anywhere on the West

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.690
 Coast coming out of San Diego.
