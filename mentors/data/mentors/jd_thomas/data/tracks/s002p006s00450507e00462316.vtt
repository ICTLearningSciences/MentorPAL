00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.730
the best plan to reach to be able to reach you if your family has an emergency,

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.610
 is was one threw off the whatever hospital or clinic that

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.490
 they're at? Tell them. Make sure that your family tells the service

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.370
 providers that the doctors that hey, I have a service member who is

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.250
 the save the patients Mom, Dad, brother, sister. And they're currently

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.130
 out to sea and give them the vessel name. And typical basically the

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.010
 duty station where they're they're they're leaving from, say, the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.890
 U. S s. You know, whatever out off San Diego, California and this part

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.780
 and give them your name and they'll be able to reach you through

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.660
 the rail. Red Cross message. Um, if they aren't they can't reach you

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.540
 that way. They could probably email you, which, in my opinion, I don't

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.420
 think that's the best method. But reach out the Red Cross and the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.300
 Red Cross message will reach the the commanding officer and you'll

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.180
 be notified that way and you'll be able thio between you and the command,

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.060
 you'll be able to make arrangements for you to, uh, developed

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.940
 some kind of plan for you. Thio possibly get home if you need to
