 that there at tell them make sure that your family tales the service

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.370
 providers that the doctors that Hey I have a service member who

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.250

 the best method but reach out the red cross and the red cross message

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.300
 will reach the the commanding officer and you'll be notified that

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.180

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.060
 to make arrangements for you to develop some kind of a plan for you

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.940
 to possibly get home if you need to
