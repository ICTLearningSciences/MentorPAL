00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.630
so to answer that question, I think it depends. It depends on the situation.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.410
 It depends on what needs to take place out of the leader in that

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.190
 role. And also it depends on your experience and your knowledge

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.960
 of the situation, as well as the leaders of the senior petty officers,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.740
 knowledge and experience in that situation. To bridge that gap and

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.520
 to move forward, you have to communicate early and often, and between

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.300
 yourself and that senior petty officer to kind of develop a understanding

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.080
 off of how he or she operates in a situation how you operate

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.860
 in a situation. It becomes like a marriage relationship between YouTube.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.630
 Kind of like, you know, shack in Kobe. You know, Jordan and

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.410
 Pippen. You know, you work well together, you learn each other, and

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.190
 you kind of know when and where he or she will be and what they'll say

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.970
 and what needs to be said. And vice versa. Fire yourself
