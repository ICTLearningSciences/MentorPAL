00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.630
so to answer that question I think it it it depends it depends on the

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.410
 situation it depends on what needs to take place out of the leader in

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.190
 that role and also depends on your experience and your knowledge of

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.960
 the situation as well as the leaders of the senior petty officer's

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.740
 knowledge and and experience in that situation to bridge that gap and

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.520
 to move forward you have to communicate early in office and between

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.300
 yourself and that senior petty officer to come to vote okay understanding

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.080
 of of how he or she operates in the situation how you operate

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.860
 in a situation it becomes like a a marriage relationship between

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.630
 you two kind of like a you know Shaq and Kobe you know Jordan and Pippen

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.410
 you know you work well together you learn each other and you kind

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.190
 of know when and where he or she will be and what they'll say and

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.970
 what needs to be see and vice versa for your yourself
