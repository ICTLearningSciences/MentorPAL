00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.600
um, I didn't find the strength of regencies. It's kind of a simple, and

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.350
 it goes back to two more words. I keep saying, Listen and observe.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.100
 By being present and being around your team, you'll notice who's more

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.850
 vocal. You'll notice who will stand out as being You know, the goal

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.600
 getter, the hard worker. You'll notice who will be more of the quiet

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.350
 one that doesn't do too much or doesn't save much, even when, during

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.100
 like 30 training evolutions or even like operating, you know who's

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.860
 the first to step up or who won't step up. And by being around and

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.610
 watching how that occurs, you'll learn where one sailor has one strength

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.360
 and another one has a weakness, and you can kind of pairing

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.110
 together and turn in that aspect. Eso As time goes on, the more you

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.860
 watching, the more you around your sailors and your team, you'll see

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.610
 who has certain strengths and who has certain weaknesses and that all

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.360
 that kind allowed you to manage. You know who to put with who and

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.110
 how the better, you know, go for how to move on from there
