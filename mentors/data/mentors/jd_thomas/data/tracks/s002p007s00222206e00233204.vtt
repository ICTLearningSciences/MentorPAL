the things that cause the most stress on the job would probably be deadlines

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 and your other personnel everyone has a a deadline to meet and

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.850
 you have this inter you know this tangled way above of deadlines and

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.840
 schedules and needs of and priorities so that definitely heightens

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.840
 the stress level you know tremendously so you may have two inspections

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.840
 coming up next week you might have a person of some sailors that

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.840

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.840
 you know some spot checks coming up you know main is coming up and

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.840

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.840

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.830
 to mention your your home life your wife's sake or your baby sick

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.830
 your wife stressed out because you leave and you know deadlines and

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.830
