00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.850
Okay, I give you a great example of what? What's What was a typical day?

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 Um, I would like to say we we were pulling into maybe Panama on deployment.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.850
 And we needed this, like, this part that it weighed about

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 £200 to We had to get it from off the ship, which was on the pier to

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.860
 the folks off the front of the ship all the way to the bottom of the

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.860
 ship in order to have an install. But this part weighed about £200.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.860
 So I just come off watch and we were rounding up, you know, everyone

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.860
 to see if we can get this thing down there. And it took us about

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.860
 15 20 minutes to round up everyone because people are scattered throughout

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.860
 the ship. So once we got everybody rounded up, um, we located

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.860
 a like a shaft that leads all the way to the bottom of the ship from

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.860
 the folks. So the idea was to have a crane load the part onto the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.860
 folks and lower it down for us. Easy day. Well, wow. The crane was

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.860
 like bringing the part on board the shaft on the crane broke, so they

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.870
 had to set the crane down. So it was. It ended up on the folks who

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.870
 but we still had to get to the bottom of ship. This thing weighed about

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.870
 £200 of dead weight. So we were, um actually, you know, being rushed.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.870
 And, you know, the captain just kind of walked through and just

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.870
 kind of noticed, like, what was going on. So he ended up giving me

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.870
 that look like you know what you're gonna do now, right? So we had

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.870
 everybody there, So we grabbed a boast of mate and asked him to tie

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.870
 a few nights. And we are tired of the part, and it took probably about

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.870
 10 of us, and we horsed it down. I think it was about maybe, like,

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.870
 seven flights of, uh, upstairs or something to, like, lower it down

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.880
 to the bottom of that ship. And after that, we ended up going to

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.880
 another evolution because we were inter import. So we had thio get out

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.880
 how the hospital service is hooked up and you know your water and

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.880
 fresh water. You're great water and all that kind of stuff. It was

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.880
 just like a typical day, you know,
