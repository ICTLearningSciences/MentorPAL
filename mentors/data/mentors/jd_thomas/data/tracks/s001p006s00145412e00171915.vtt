00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.850
okay I give you a great example of what was what was a typical day I would

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 like to say we we were pulling into may be tomorrow on deployment

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.850
 and we needed this Michael this part that it weighed about two hundred

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 pounds two we had to get it from off the ship which was on the

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.860
 pier to the folks of the front of the ship all the way to the bottom

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.860
 of the ship in order to have an install but this part with about two

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.860
 hundred pounds so I had just come off why us and we were rounded

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.860
 up you know everyone to see if we can get this thing down there and

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.860
 it took us about fifteen twenty minutes to round up everyone because

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.860
 you people are scattered throughout the ship so once we got everybody

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.860
 rounded up we located a like a shaft that led all the way to the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.860
 bottom of the ship from the folks so the idea was to have a crane low

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.860
 the part on to this the fo'c'sle and you know lower downforce easy

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.860
 day well wow the crane was sweet like bringing the the part on board

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.870
 the shaft on the crane broke so they had to set the crane down so

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.870
 he well it ended up on the folks but we still have to get to the bottom

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.870
 of the ship this thing wait about two hundred pounds and their weight

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.870
 so we were actually you know being rushed and you know the captain

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.870
 just kind of walk through and just kinda notice like what was going

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.870
 on so he ended up giving me the look like you know what you're

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.870
 going to now right so we had everybody here so we grabbed a boatswain's

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.870
 mate and asked in a tie a few not and we tied up to par and it took

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.870
 probably about ten of us and we Horsted it down but I think it was

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.870
 about maybe like seven flight so of stairs or something to light

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.880
 lowered down to the bottom of this year and after that we ended up going

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.880
 to another evolution because we were in a report so we had to get

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.880
 all the how the hospital services hooked up in you know your your

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.880
 water and fresh water your gray water not a kind of stuff it was I

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.880
 was just like a typical day you know
