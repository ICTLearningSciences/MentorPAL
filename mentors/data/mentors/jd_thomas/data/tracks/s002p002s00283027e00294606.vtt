00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.900
all the differences between us and other branches are for one I think

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.960
 our our culture a big day for me especially when I joined was the fact

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.010
 that if you join the navy nine times out of ten you'll be around

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.060
 some form of water and hello unlike being an airforce at armories I

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.110
 didn't want to be anywhere near the desert or anywhere near like a bunch

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.170
 of just like nature I didn't want to sleep have to sleep out in

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.220
 a few hours sleep in a little car ownership at the bottom of the ship

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.270
 as opposed to sleeping out in the desert so I would say those are

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.320
 like two of the big things is just the the location is that you're

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.380
 operating in and the climate in environments operating in and just a

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.430
 culture of of being a sailor been on his side you can calm the notice

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.480
 like a definitely a raw raw you know mentality out of the say the

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.530
 marines and army and the airforce is more like laid back like we're

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.590
 kind of casual and the mayor and the navy just kind of like in the

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.640
 middle you know
