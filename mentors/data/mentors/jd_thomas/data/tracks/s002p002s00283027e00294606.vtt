00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.900
right. Um, the differences between us and the other branches are for one.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.960
 I think our culture, um, a big day for me, especially when I joined,

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.010
 was the fact that if you join the Navy nine times out of 10 you'll

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.060
 be around some form of water and, uh, unlike being an air force

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.110
 of the Army or the Marines, I didn't want to be anywhere near the desert

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.170
 or anywhere near like a bunch of just like nature. I didn't want

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.220
 to sleep after sleep out in the field. I rather sleep in a little

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.270
 cot on the ship at the bottom of the ship, as opposed to sleeping out

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.320
 in the desert. So I would say those are like two of the big things

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.380
 is just the locations that you're operating in and the climate and

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.430
 environment operating in, and just the culture of being a sailor. Um,

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.480
 being on their side, you can kind of notice like a definitely a rah

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.530
 rah, you know, mentality out of the say, the Marines and the Army

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.590
 And the Air Force is more like laid back, like we're kind of casual

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.640
 on the neighbors, just kind of like in the middle, you know,
