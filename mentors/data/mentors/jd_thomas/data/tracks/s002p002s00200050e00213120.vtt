00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.890
um, with supervisors who are unwilling or unable to give you feedback

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.930
 again, you have to. This is kind of a tough one, because there are personnel

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.970
 out there who don't really respond to feet that oh, are you

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.010
 don't give feedback when things are good or things are bad. You simply

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.040
 have to take note of, um, the demands that they're placed under

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.080
 and what's required of those. The man. Um, as time goes on your you'll

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.120
 learn the things that they like, whether it be certain colors and

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.160
 power points of certain graphs and power points, certain products handed

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.200
 or email to them and certain times of day times of the day. But

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.240
 it's definitely just something for you, too. You just have to learn.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.280
 Um, it's also within your ability to actually going up in approach

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.320
 a senior and say, you know, respond and ask the question. You know,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.360
 how do you like certain things? How do you like this? What products

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.390
 do you want? You know, Do you want eight o'clock reports delivered

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.430
 at five o'clock? Do you want you know, things in writing Do would you

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.470
 rather me call you? You know those are things the questions that

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.510
 you have to take the initiative and have the developed the forethought

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.550
 to ask of a senior if they are willing to offer.
