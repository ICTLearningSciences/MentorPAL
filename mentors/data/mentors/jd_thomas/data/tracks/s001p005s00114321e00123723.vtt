00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.250
my view of this line of work, it's it hasn't changed that much. Um, again,

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.650
 you just kind of go into each and every situation each and every

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.060
 tour, looking too affected positively and the things that you learn

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.460
 and the things the ordeals and experiences that you go through it

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.860
 you just take it on as a learning experience, something that you could

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.260
 add into your toolbox to help someone or something going forward.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.660
 So my outlook on this career it is still the same still move, headed

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.070
 out to save the world or help someone save the work. And just to be

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.470
 in incorporate a positive and productive working environment in whatever

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.870
 command, a situation that I'm going into.
