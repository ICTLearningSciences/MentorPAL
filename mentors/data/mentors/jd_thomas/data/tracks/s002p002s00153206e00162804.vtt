00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.940
nuke qualifications. It depends on the requirements a CE faras qualifications.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.030
 But in terms off personality traits, um, work ethic is a big

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.120
 one. Initiative is a big one. Um, attitude is a big one. So those

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.210
 were probably be three huge factors in terms of looking for a team member.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.300
 Other things you can kind of develop and work to develop going

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.380
 forward. But if they have a work effort, work ethic, that's like half

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.470
 the battle because of you, a person works hard and they take the

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.560
 initiative to do something. It's kind of, ah, what a lot of people

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.650
 in the Navy say a fire. Forget I can ask a person to do something. And

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.740
 before I'm finished with my question, there is already halfway done,

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.830
 So work ethic is is huge for me.
