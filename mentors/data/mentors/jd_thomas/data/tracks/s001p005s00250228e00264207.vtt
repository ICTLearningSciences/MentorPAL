00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.840
some good resource is to use before entering the fleet or wherever you

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.830
 may be hit. It would be to use your peers, use mentors. Those are two

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.820
 of my favorites. Asking questions from different and receiving different

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.810
 perspectives on certain situations always helps out. It's always

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.790
 a plus. Thio here, a mentor who's been in a situation, describe

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.780
 how they reacted on the things that the lessons they learned from being

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.770
 in certain situations. That's always a favorite of mine. There

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.760
 are tons of books and magazines and articles on leadership being in

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.750
 different situations. Look, look in the past, uh, there's a tons of

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.740
 situations off leaders and people throughout history who have gone through

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.730
 Ah, you know, different ordeals and experiences. Thio, you know,

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.720
 be successful as leaders. I took a class here at the Naval Postgraduate

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.710
 School my first quarter, and it discussed the, um, um, a disaster

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.700
 down on one of light headed towards like the Antarctica, an Arctic

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.680
 and about a group of sailors who were stuck down there for almost

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.670
 a year and 1/2 and the story revolved around the the Captain who

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.660
 got hit. He got his crew out of there So there are tons of resource

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.650
 that you used, Thio. You no further develop. But you again you have

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.640
 to take your ego out of it and listen and learn and read from a different

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.630
 perspective.
