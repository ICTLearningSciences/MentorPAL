00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.720
before is available letters you a question if we're going to war time

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.580
 and say certain Cassidy's happen on the ship would that be something

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.450
 that you would like or something that you would be a good fit for the

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.320
 idea behind being placed an assignment that you don't like and that

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.180
 you may not be a good fit just to see how you adapt to situations

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.050
 where you're not comfortable so the entire community the small community

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.920
 is about being uncomfortable are you going to just about every

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.780
 bill it not knowing what you're doing or how to do it sometimes so

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.650
 I would say going to this assignment this bill it with a positive attitude

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.520
 and a can do attitude in being able to use your resources wisely

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.380
 so think positive of get to know the people understand the situation

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.250
 and solve problems this what you're there to do so the idea is

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.120
 to learn something find more tools and develop more to to put in your

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.980
 toolbox so that you could one day be a leader or great leader in this

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.850
 and the world's greatest maybe
