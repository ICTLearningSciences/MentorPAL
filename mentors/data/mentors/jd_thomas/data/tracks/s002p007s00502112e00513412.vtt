00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.410
before I answer that, I would like to ask you a question. Um, if we're

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.970
 going to war time and say certain casualties happened on the ship,

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.540
 would that be something that you would like or something that you wouldn't

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.100
 be a good fit for? The idea behind being placed on an assignment,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.660
 that you don't like it and that you may not be a good fit just

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.230
 to see how you adapt to situations where you're not comfortable. So,

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.790
 uh, the entire community, the small community, is about being uncomfortable.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.350
 You're going to just about every bill, it not knowing what

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.910
 you're doing or how to do it sometimes. So I would say go into this

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.470
 assignment. This billet with a positive attitude and a can do attitude

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.040
 and being able to use your resource is wise and so think positive,

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.600
 get to know the people understand the situation and solve problems.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.160
 That's what you're there to do. So the idea is to learn something,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.730
 find more tools and develop more twos to put in your toolbox so that

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.290
 you could one day be a leader or a great leader in this world's greatest

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.850
