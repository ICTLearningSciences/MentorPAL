00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.610
huh? Preparing for a tough situation or even a stressful situation? It

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.370
 could be. You could even be an inspection that's come up. You don't

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.120
 prepare for that mission or that inspection while it's right before

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.880
 it's happening. So it's a mindset. So you prepare, just like you would

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.640
 prepare them for, say, a football game. Or for a baseball game,

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.400
 you have to encourage them. You have to motivate them. You have to be

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.150
 positive. You have to. You have to be that be the one motivating factor

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.910
 behind the team. So you encourage them by, you know, being there.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.670
 I'm a very vocal and boisterous person. So my thing, Woz too yelled

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.430
 and screen. You know, if we're about to start a revolution and say

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.180
 an inspection is about to happen and I'm out there, I'm yelling.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.940
 I'm screaming. I'm encouraging my team. I'm letting them know that Lieutenant

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.700
 Thomas is behind. You were there. Whether we win, lose, fail,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.460
 we're going to do it together. And I think just having that that

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.210
 backing that support says a lot, So just be, be there, be there to

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.970
 encourage and just let him know you're you're you're their support system

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.730
 that you got
