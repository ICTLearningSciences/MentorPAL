to get a real problem with the team members first is communication you

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.140

 out the same word is empathy if you have an issue do you how do you

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.430
 want to be let you want someone to sit down and talk to you at like

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.080
 a human being and discuss the issue and move for or do you want to be

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.720

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.370

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.010
 professionally and respectfully to appear plus Salem's have an

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.660
 issue
