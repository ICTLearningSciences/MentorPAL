00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.500
to get to the root of a problem with the team members First is communication

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.140
 you as a leader, you're expected to lead by example, and I keep

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.790
 throwing out the same word is empathy. If you were having issued,

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.430
 how do you want to be late? Would you want someone Thio sit down and

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.080
 talk to you like a human being and discussed the issue and move for?

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.720
 Or do you want to be cursed? That screamed and yelled at, removed

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.370
 from the situation altogether? There's two ways to go about doing that,

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.010
 and I prefer communicating professionally and respectfully to a

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.660
 a sailor who's having issues.
