00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.460
keep stressed from boarding over. Probably my favorite tip that I always

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.080
 give would probably be to go to your happy place. Um, everyone has

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.690
 that one place in mind that they rather be on with that person that

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.300
 they rather be with or people. And I always tell people to go to your

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.920
 happy place in your mind. So when you're about to blow when you're

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.530
 about to lose it, when you feel like the stress is just becoming

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.140
 too much, just stop and take about maybe about 30 seconds to a minute

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.750
 and just go to your happy place and think about how you feel at that

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.370
 moment when you're in your happy place and who you're with and the

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.980
 conversations they you may have with that person, too. Help you deal

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.590
 with, You know, tough times. I always use the example of Superman

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.210
 when Superman is dealing with the worst case scenario. You know, aliens

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.820
 about take over the world or someone's about to blow the world

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.430
 up, and he's at the lowest at the low of his Lois. He always goes home

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.050
 to mind pocket down in Kansas and they build him back up, give him

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.660
 the strength he needs to do whatever he needs to do
