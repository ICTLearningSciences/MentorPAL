00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.460
keep stress from born over who are probably my favorite tip that I always

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.080
 give will probably be to go to your happy place everyone has that

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.690
 one place in mind that they rather be and it with that person that

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.300
 they rather be with or people and I always tell people to go to your

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.920
 happy place in your mind so when you're about to blow you're about

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.530
 to lose it when you feel like the stress is just becoming too much

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.140
 to stop and take about maybe about thirty seconds to a minute and just

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.750
 go to your happy place and think about how you feel at that that

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.370
 moment when you're in your happy place and who you're with the conversation

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.980
 is baby you may have with that person to help you deal with

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.590
 you know tough times always use the example of Superman our server is

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.210
 dealing with the worst case scenarios you know Haley is about to go

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.820
 to world or you know someone about to blow the world up and he's at

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.430
 the lowest at the low of his loans he always goes home to my pocket

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.050
 down in Kansas and they build him back up give him the strength he

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.660
 needs to do whatever he needs to do
