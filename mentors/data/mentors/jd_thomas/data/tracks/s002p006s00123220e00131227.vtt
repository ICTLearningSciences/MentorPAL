00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.300
I'll do my best to never take my work home with me. I don't study at home.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.750
 Um, I don't do my best to never, ever, ever, ever, ever take your

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.210
 work home. When you start to bridge that gap between home and work,

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.660
 that's where you lose. Focus off and you lose that balance of home

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.110
 life work life because now you're at home working about worrying about

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.560
 work, and then you'll go to work and you're worried about home.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.020
 So by not taking my work home, I learned that's like a a big separation,

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.470
 Ah, lining the saying that I don't cross, I'll do my best not

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.920
 to.
