00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.010
well that's a perfect question I'm actually happy to answer that one you

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:11.170
 know Milo whole notion is of you should by when you're comfortable

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.330
 because this is something this is an investment that you have to live

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.490
 with for the rest your life if you have the means to bar home I

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.650
 think you should do so but that's also taken into consideration your

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.820
 personal finances as well as the the situation within the the housing

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.980
 market I purchased my first house of about three years ago almost

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.140
 I was what twenty nine so Belmont thing was I didn't have the money

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.300
 saved up until I was twenty nine to purchase a house but also took

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.460
 into consideration you know my follow worn a duty stations what I'll

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.620
 be station back in Jackson will lobby chances of me being a station

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.780
 in San Diego or no full are greater than Jacksonville and you don't

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.940
 plan on going back to Jacksonville why buy houses so the these are

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.100
 things that you have to take into consideration when you decide to buy

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.260
 a house or or when you do decide to rent I've had this conversation

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.430
 with a few of my buddies who are more senior and are on the backing

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.590
 of their career and some of have never owned houses and some are

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.750
 in the market to purchase houses simply because it's there finishing

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.910
 their career and they their families our own they're looking to settle

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.070
 down in one place and stay in one place so it kind of depends on

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.230
 what you want to do as a person do you want to have a vestment rental

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.390
 properties or do you want to read it until you decide to retire is

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.550
 it solely up to you but I personally would use the resources that

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.710
 are available to me when it comes to decide to buy a home so each base

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.870
 has a like a fleeting family support centers where they give housing

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:15.040
 housing classes to help you I'll give you help you make a more informed

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.200
 formative decision when it comes to buying a house also your

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.360
 CMC I just seen a senior leadership now almost ninety percent sure

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.520
 that you're a CEO and so has a home or owns a home for all several homes

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.680
 so use the resources within your command as well as outside to

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.840
 ship you make that decision
