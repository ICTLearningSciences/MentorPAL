00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.010
That's a perfect question. I'm actually happy to answer that. You know,

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:11.170
 my whole notion is you should by when you're comfortable, because

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.330
 this is something this is an investment that you'll have to live with

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.490
 for the rest of your life. Um, if you have the means to by home, I

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.650
 think you should do so. But that's also taking into consideration your

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.820
 personal finances as well as the situation within the housing market.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.980
 Um, I purchased my first house about three years ago. Almost.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.140
 I was, what, 29. So about my thing was, I didn't have the money saved

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.300
 up until I was 29 to purchase the house, but also took him to consideration.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.460
 You know, my follow on duty stations. Would I be stationed

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.620
 back in Jacksonville? Will I be chances of me being stationed in San

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.780
 Diego or no phone are greater than Jacksonville. And you don't plan

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.940
 on going back to Jacksonville? Why buy a house in Jackson s O? These

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.100
 are things that you have to take into consideration when you decide

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.260
 to buy a house or when you decide to rent. Um, I've had this conversation

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.430
 with a few of my buddies who are more senior and are on the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.590
 back end of their career. And some of have never own houses. And some

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.750
 are in the market to purchase houses simply because it's there finishing

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.910
 their career. And they, their families are there looking to

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.070
 settle down in one place and stay in one place. So it kind of depends

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.230
 on what you want to do as a person. Do you want to have investment

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.390
 rental properties, or do you want to rent until you decide to retire?

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.550
 It's solely up to you. But, uh, hi person would use the resources

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.710
 that are available to me when it comes to decided to buy a home. So

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.870
 each base has a, uh, like a fleeting family support centers where

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:15.040
 they give housing, um, housing classes to help you give you help. You

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.200
 make amore informer former the decision When it comes to buying houses.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.360
 Also, your CMC, your senior senior leadership, I'm not almost

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.520
 90% sure that your seal XO has a home or owns the home or on several

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.680
 homes, so use the resource is within your command as well as outside.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.840
