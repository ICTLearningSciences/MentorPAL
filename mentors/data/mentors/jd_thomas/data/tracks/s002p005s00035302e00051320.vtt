00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.570
arm I have a face the numbers shown just throughout my career the first

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.280
 challenge was to balance family and home life with the your new career

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.000
 that's a challenge in itself the neighbors very demanding and I

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.720
 like to laugh and joke you know you know with my girlfriend and say

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.430
 Hey you know you're the mistress going into this situation and the

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.150
 navy's my wife so you know you have to give in where you fit in but

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.870
 that's it's somewhat that somewhere that's true so you as the service

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.580
 member you have to find that work life balance on the second challenge

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.300
 I'm going through some challenges throughout you know some of my

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.010
 training I was a flight school to try so I went to was commission

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.730
 as a naval flight officers students initially so that was the the probably

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.450
 the biggest challenge that I faced throughout my career one word

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.160
 of one piece of advice I can say to anyone going through a similar

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.880
 challenge would be to look at every opportunity as a learn a lesson

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.600
 and think of the positives always have a positive attitude and always

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.310
 having a can do attitude no matter what so those were probably

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.030
 the two biggest challenges I face so far
