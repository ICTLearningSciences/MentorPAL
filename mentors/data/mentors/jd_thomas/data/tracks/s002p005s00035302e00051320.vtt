00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.570
um, I have faced the numerous challenges throughout my career. Um, the

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.280
 first challenge was to balance family and home life with your new career.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.000
 That's a challenging in itself. The Navy is very demanding, and

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.720
 I like to laugh and joke, you know, with my girlfriend and say, You

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.430
 know, you're the mistress going into this situation and the Navy's

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.150
 my wife So you know, you have to get in where you fit in, but that's

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.870
 somewhat that some way that's true. Eso you as the service member,

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.580
 you have to find that work life balance. On the second challenge.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.300
 I've gone through some challenges throughout. You know, some of my training.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.010
 I was a flight school to try, so I went to I was commissioned

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.730
 as a Naval flight officer student initially, so that was a probably

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.450
 the biggest challenge that I faced throughout my career. One word

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.160
 at one piece of advice, I could say to anyone going through Ah, similar

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.880
 challenge would be to look at every opportunity as ah ah, learning

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.600
 lesson and think of the positives, always having a positive attitude

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.310
 and always having a can do attitude, no matter what. So those were

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.030
 probably two biggest challenges off a so far
