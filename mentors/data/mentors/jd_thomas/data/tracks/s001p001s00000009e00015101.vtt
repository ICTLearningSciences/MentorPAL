00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.400
I'm Lieutenant J. D. Thomas. I'm here at the Naval Postgraduate School

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.940
 pursuing a master's degree in financial management. Prior to coming

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.490
 to MPs, I was the A ops and the as well for a desert on staff in Mayport,

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.030
 Florida Prior to my second tour, I was four deployed on the USS

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.580
 Lassen and you Kuska Japan as the repair officer and the C E Devil.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.130
 I was there for about 20 months, and my first tour probably was the

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.670
 most challenging tour today. There was a lot of ups and downs of

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.220
 my division. My division was composed of about 27 personnel. We had

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.760
 a couple of newly frakked first classes, so it was a lot of junior sailors.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.310
 So we all had a huge learning curves like You get around together,

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.860
 of course, being in damage control and owning the all the fire

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.400
 equipment, the toilets, sinks and everything. You know, of course,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.950
 things break and you know you're responsible for that kind of stuff.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.490
 So it's nonstop 20 months tour, so I felt very challenging, but at

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.040
 same time is very rewarding. Prior to reaching the USS Lassen, I was

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.590
 enlisted for two years as a undesignated airman in a Halo squadron

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.130
 out in Jacksonville, Florida HSM 70 um prior to enlisting, served as

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.680
 a ah therapist in a rehab center in one of the local hospitals back

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.220
 where I'm from in Georgia. Oh, in which I had earned my bastards degree

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.770
 from Georgia Southern University.
