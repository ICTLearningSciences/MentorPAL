00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.760
well two things that I always do or more than two a one thing is you know

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.660
 problems always work themselves out so you definitely do what you

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.570
 can with what you have when you came I like the whole notion or the

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.470
 now do the you handle the close is allocated to the boat so if you

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.380
 don't know that saying just think about you being in a a little daily

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.290
 with you know five or six alligators come to the boat you don't have

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.190
 an old war which one you also get first you know the keep you in

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.100
 the bow in alligators audible another thing is always be to always

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.000
 to stay positive and time management time management another thing were

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.910
 you did you might be able to do a little bit here and there on each

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.820
 task but eventually they all get done and lastly I I use this a

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.720
 lot in until and I'll talk to I thought the sailors and my peers a lot

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.630
 is found a happy place when you're the most stressful and you feel

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.530
 like you're about to break down remember that one place in the world

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.440
 that you would rather be and with one person that you would rather

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.350
 be with and go there in your mind for about five minutes and once

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.250
 you do that just take a deep breath think about the conversations you

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.160
 that person may have and how it makes you feel you know makes you

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.060
 feel stronger makes you feel better and then after those few minutes

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.970
 of meditating come back home and do what you need to do
