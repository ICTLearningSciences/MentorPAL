00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.520
two things that I always do or more than 21 thing is, you know, problems

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.190
 always work themselves out. S O You definitely do what you can with

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.870
 what you have when you can. Um, I like the whole notion or the analogy.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.540
 You handle the closest alligator to the boat. So if you don't

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.210
 know that saying, just think about you being in AA AA Little dingy

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.880
 with five or six alligators come into the boat, you only having Or which

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.560
 one of you gonna swing at first, you know, to keep you in the boat

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.230
 and the alligators out of boat. Um, another thing is always be always

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.900
 to stay positive and time management time management's another

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.570
 thing where you might be able to do a little bit here and there on

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.250
 each task, but eventually they all get done. And lastly, um, I use this

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.920
 a lot, and I till and I talked to when I talked to sailors and my

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.590
 peers a lot is find a happy place. You're the most stressful, and

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.260
 you feel like you're about to break down. Remember that one place in

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.940
 the world that you would rather be and with one person that you would

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.610
 rather be with and go there in your mind for about five minutes.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.280
 And once you do that, just take a deep breath. I think about the conversations

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.950
 you and that person may have and how it makes you feel, you

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.630
 know, makes you feel stronger, makes you feel better. And then, after

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.300
 those few minutes of meditating, come back home and do what you

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.970
 need to do.
