00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.380
um so travel is typically paid through. Uh, I think it's, ah, a couple

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.910
 of different ways. If you're on orders, uh, travel can be paid for

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.440
 by the by the service member or through, um, basically through Millington,

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.970
 who's who actually provides you your orders so they'll send you

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.500
 out saying advance pay where you there Lots of certain amount of

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.030
 money to travel from point A to point B. And the idea is for you to

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.560
 keep my receipts and turning travel claim, uh, showing how you spent

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:45.100
 those monies for travel. Or if you're on official, like, say, for traveling

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.630
 for an exercise or something and you have a government travel

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:56.160
 car, you could spend those moneys through using that government travel

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.690
 car in a program called DTs. Which of the defense travel system

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.220
 if I'm not mistaken, so you're going there on every command has a

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.750
 typically like a yeoman or a PS who will show you how to use this program,

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.280
 and you go in there and you create your travel to travel from

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.810
 Point A to point B. Using that government travel card
