00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.380
so trouble is typically paid through I think it's a couple different ways

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.910
 at your own orders traveled can be paid for by the by the service

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.440
 member or through basically to Millington who's who actually provides

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.970
 you your orders so they'll send you out say in advance pay were

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.500
 you there a lot to a certain amount of money to travel from point a

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.030
 to point B. and the ideas for you to keep our eye receives internal

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.560
 travel clay showing how you spend those monies for travel or if you're

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:45.100
 on official like say for traveling for an exercise or something and

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.630
 you have a government travel car you can spin those monies through

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:56.160
 using that government travel car in a program called DTS which of

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.690
 the the defense travel system if I'm not mistaken so you're going there

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.220
 and every command has a typically like a a young woman or a a PS

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.750
 who will show you how to use this program and you going here you creature

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.280
 travel to travel from point a to point B. using that government

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.810
 travel car
