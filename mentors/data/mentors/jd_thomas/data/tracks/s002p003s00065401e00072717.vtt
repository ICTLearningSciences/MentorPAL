I don't think there really is a secret sauce. It's just understanding

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.900
 that we're all human and we're We're here to whatever situation it may

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.430
 be on a different circumstances, eh? So if you can respect someone,

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.960
 if you can be professional, if you can empathize with someone and

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.480
 you can communicate with someone, I feel as if everything will work

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.010
 out the way it's supposed to be. There is no super sauce.
