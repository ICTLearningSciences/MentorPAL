I think that's a question that I should ask you where things are more

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.700
 important you when picking houses my personal thing is when it comes

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.630
 to me I like my own space I like comfort ally garages because I like

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.560
 cars I like to build cars and I like suburbs so those things make

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.480
 me you know happy ideally what you're doing is what you're looking for

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.410
 houses as a service member you're you're trying to eight a positive

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.340
 and productive work of positive and productive home life for you

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.260
 to go back to what you had a stressful day at work so if you have a

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.190
 long hard day at work you know trying to think of the things that you

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.120
 want to have around you when you go home so that could be of open

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.050
 concept single story ranch house with recessed lighting or it could

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.970
 be a one bedroom studio whatever makes you comfortable that you're willing

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.900
 to go home and turn the phones off turn the TV is off it just

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.830
 be happy being home so think about those things were you looking for

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.750
