00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.780
I think that's a question that I should ask you what? Things are more

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.700
 important, you win picking houses. Um, my personal thing is, um, when

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.630
 it comes to me, I like my own space. I like comfort. I like garages

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.560
 because I like cars. I like to build cars and I like suburbs. So those

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.480
 things make me, you know, happy. Ideally, what you're doing is

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.410
 you're looking for housing as, ah, service member, you're trying to,

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.340
 um, create a positive and productive work positive, productive home

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.260
 life for you, too. Go back to once You've had a stressful day at work.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.190
 So if you have a long and hard at work, you know, trying to think

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.120
 of the things that you want to have around you when you go home. So

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.050
 that could be, Ah, open concept, single story ranch house with recess

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.970
 lighting. Or it could be a one bedroom studio. Whatever makes you

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.900
 comfortable that you're willing to go home and turn the phones off,

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.830
 turn the TV's off and just be happy being home. So I think about those

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.750
 things when you're looking for housing. Of course, you have to

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.680
 find someplace that's within your budget
