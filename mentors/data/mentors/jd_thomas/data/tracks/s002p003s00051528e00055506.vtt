00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.820
one big, too big things to know about your team members are their strengths

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.790
 and weaknesses, and you get that by watching them interact with

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.760
 each other of the team's other personnel. A observing who they are

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.730
 as people and how they respond to certain situation. I'm a big proponent

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.710
 proponent of watching someone's verbal and nonverbal cues when

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.680
 I communicate with them, and I think that that will help you learn

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.650
 a lot a SW, far as your team members in terms of their strengths and

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.620
 weaknesses, to better manage them as a team altogether.
