00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.530
um, as far as relationship with us subordinates, I had ah, Chief Petty

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.210
 officer. Once he told me that if you always keep it professional, you

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.890
 would never have to worry about anything. So I would take that notion

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.570
 if you and I would add onto it. Stay professional, stay respectful,

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.250
 Stay cordial and and yummy includes something in your personality.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.930
 Never always be genuine is what I'm trying to say. So genuineness.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.610
 Be cordial. Be respectful, be professional and be respected and just

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.290
 stay true to yourself. And things will flow how they're supposed

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.970
 to flow now. Giving you won't get along and be buddy buddy with everyone.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.650
 But you keep those things in mind and you will always have a

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.330
 positive and productive working environment with those subordinates.
