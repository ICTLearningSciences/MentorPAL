preparing for a tough situation or even a stressful situation. It could

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.930
 be. You could even be an inspection that's come up. You don't prepare

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.960
 for that mission or that inspection while it's right before it's

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.000
 happening. So it's a mindset. So you prepare, just like you would prepare

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.040
 them for, say, a football game. Or for a baseball game you have

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.080
 to encourage them. You have to motivate them. You have to be positive.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.110
 You have to. You have to be that be the one motivating factor

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.150

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.260
 is about to happen and I'm out there, I'm yelling, I'm screaming.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.300
 I'm encouraging my team. I'm letting them know that Lieutenant Thomas

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.340
 is behind. You were there. Whether we win, lose, fail, we're going

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.380
 to do it together. And I think just having that that backing that

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.410
 support says a lot, So just be, be there, be there to encourage and

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.450
 just let him know you. You're their support system that you got
