our common mistakes are see new leaders make our not listening and not

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:12.400
 observers my mom would always say she still says to this day you listen

 you have to out two years two eyes and one mouth for a reason so

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.950
 listen and observe more than you speak nothing new leaders do more

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:29.730
 talking and less listening then then anything and that's a big mistake

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.500

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.280

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.050
 and skip steps and that causes issues Amman team members and say

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.830
 throughout a command so
