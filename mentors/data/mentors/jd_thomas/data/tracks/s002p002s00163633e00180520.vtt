00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.080
as far as relationship with those in charge. Again, you respond to, uh,

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.310
 verbal and non verbal cues, and also by keeping it professional and

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:16.530
 respectful. You have a lot off seniors who have, ah, difficult time

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.760
 responding to the new generation of sailors that are coming in. So

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.990
 it's kind of hard to for them to empathize and understand how to approach

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.220
 in interact with some of the younger service. And that's understandable.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.440
 But you as a a subordinate to, say a senior, you have to

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.670
 be able to understand that things aren't perfect. Take your ego out

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.900
 of it and find out what makes the boss t What makes them happy. And

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.130
 what makes them happy will make you happy because they're happy. So

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.350
 with that relationship, just do your best to keep it professional and

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.580
 respectful. If you keep it professional, you won't have to wear about

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.810
 anything going south. So nine times out of 10 don't respond with

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.040
 how you really feel. Just keep it professional and keep it respectful.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.260
 Sometimes you may feel like you want to react like in a negative

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.490
 manner, but that won't go well for you, so keep it professional and

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.720
 keep a respectful
