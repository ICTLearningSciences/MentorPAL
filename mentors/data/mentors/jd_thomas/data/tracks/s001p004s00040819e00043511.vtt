00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.340
simple, simple way to track your tasks are thio. Maintain a planner, find

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.820
 a pocket planner and basically write down all your tasks and organize

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.310
 them. Keep them organized. You're going to write, I would say,

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.800
 Write down every task that you have, no matter how minuscule, matter

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.280
 how great, and transfer it over from day to day, and that will allow

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.770
 you to keep track of all your task.
