00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.900
um, with supervisors who are unwilling or unable to give you feedback

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.950
 again, you have to. This is kind of a tough one, because there are personnel

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.000
 out there who don't really respond to feet back. Oh, are you?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.050
 Don't give feedback when things are good or things are bad. You simply

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.100
 have to take note off, um, the demands that they're placed under

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.150
 and what's required of those demands. Um, as time goes on your you'll

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.200
 learn the things that they like, whether it be certain colors and

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.250
 power points of certain graphs and power points, certain products

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.300
 handed or email to them and certain times of day times of the day.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.360
 But it's definitely just something for you, too. You just have to learn.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.410
 Um, it's also within your ability to actually going up in approach

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.460
 a senior and say, you know, respond and ask the question. You know,

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.510
 how do you like certain things? How do you like this? What products

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.560
 do you want? You know, Do you want eight o'clock reports delivered

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.610
 at five o'clock? Do you want you know, things in writing Do would

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.660
 you rather me call you? You know, those are things the questions that

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.710
 you have to take the initiative and have the developed the forethought

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.760
 to ask of a senior if they are willing to offer.
