00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.450
a SZ faras benefit she should take advantage of. Um, I'm a personal fan

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.040
 of the V A loan when it comes to a person in the home that allows

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.640
 you to save a substantial a lot of money when you're buying, say, your

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.240
 first house. Oh, are an investment property. It comes with certain

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.830
 stipulations, but I think it's Ah, definitely an avenue you should

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.430
 venture into or think about when I decided to buy a home. Also, a lot

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.030
 of the credit card companies allow you to obtain credit cards with

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.620
 extensive fees. That's if you are on a if you are responsible enough

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.220
 to handle that responsibility of owning a credit card, which I assume

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.820
 you are because you're a junior officer in the Navy. So I'll give

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.410
 you, for example, and I'm not advocating for anyone cos just one

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.010
 that I used. American Express has a number of credit cards with um,

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.610
 they allow a lot of perks. For example, gold status for these hotel

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.210
 chains of rental car changes. You get like an upgraded member status

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.800
 for just being just owning the car and normally as ah, save typical

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.400
 consumer, you pay about 500 to 600 bucks a year in credit card fees

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.000
 for just having a car. But through the Civil Service Civil Servicemember

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.590
 Relief Act or something, you're allowed to bypass those fees and

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.190
 obtain that car. And though these cars give you a lot of perks and

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.790
 a lot of benefits, so those are just too, that I I used to my advantage

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.380
 by using his credit cards. I'm able to pay off my expenses and

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.980
 on these credit cards and obtained all the points behind them so you

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.580
 can use the points towards flights and hotels, vacations, even like

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.170
 a tournament for, like cash, depending on the situation. So those

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.770
 are just two things that I like to take advantage of.
