00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.450
as far as benefits you should take advantage of I'm a personal friend

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.040
 of the VA loan when it comes to all a person in a home that allows you

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.640
 to save a substantial a lot of money when you're buying so your first

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.240
 house or an investment property it comes with a certain stipulations

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.830
 but I think it's a a definitely an Avenue you should venture into

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.430
 or think about when deciding about home also a lot of the credit

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.030
 card companies allow you to obtain credit cards with extensive fees

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.620
 that's if you are on a if you are responsible enough to handle that

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.220
 responsibility of owning a credit card which I assume you are because

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.820
 you're a junior officer in the navy so far give you for example and

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.410
 I'm not advocating for anyone companies just one that I use American

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.010
 Express has a number of credit cards with this they allow a lot

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.610
 of perks for example goes status for are these hotel chains a record

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.210
 chains you get like an upgraded member status for just being just alone

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.800
 in the car and normally as a save typical consumer you'd pay about

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.400
 five hundred to six hundred Bucks a year and credit card fees for

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.000
 just having a car but through the civil service civil service member

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.590
 relief act or something you're allowed to by pass those fees and

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.190
 and and obtain that car and though these cars give you a lot of parks

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.790
 and a lot of benefits so those are just too that I I used to my advantage

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.380
 by using his credit cards I'm able to Hey all my expenses and

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.980
 on these credit cards and obtain all the points behind them so you

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.580
 can use the points towards flights and hotels vacations and even like

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.170
 turned me in for like Kay is depending on the situation so those

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.770
