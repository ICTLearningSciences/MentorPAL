00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.070
I think it affected tremendously on one side of the coin. Your you have

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.290
 the chance of impacting and command with who you are and how you are

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.500
 as a person. And on the other side of that, that command will impact

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.720
 you in almost the same manner. So you have to consciously, uh, make

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.940
 an effort to incorporate the positive things but resist the negative

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.160
 things. And at the same time, do, uh, do the same with yourself,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.380
 You know, as far as what you bring. Excuse me to that command. So

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.590
 I think the impact is mutual, you know? But I was actually I remember

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.810
 talking to a guy when I was in college, it was about a fraternity,

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.030
 and I felt a negative way about a certain fraternity. And hey, basically

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.250
 looked at me and said, Hey, you know, you have to build the fraternity

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.460
 around you, you know, don't build yourself around the paternity,

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.680
 and I think that may you know all the difference in the world
