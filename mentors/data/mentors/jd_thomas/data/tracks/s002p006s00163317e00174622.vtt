00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.470
not that I think it have been affected tremendously on one side of the

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.090
 corn your you have the chance of impacting the command with who you

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.710
 are and how you are as a person and on the other side of that that

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.330
 command will impact you in almost the same manner so you have to consciously

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.950
 make an effort to incorporate the positive things but resist

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.570
 the negative things and at the same time do do the same with yourself

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.180
 you know as far as what you bring excuse me to that command so I

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.800
 think the impact is mutual you know but I were I was actually I remember

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.420
 talking to a god I was in college it was about a fraternity and

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.040
 I'll fill a negative way about the surge attorney and he basically

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.660
 looked at me and said Hey you know you have to bill the fraternity

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.280
 around you you know don't build yourself around the paternity and I

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.900
 think that may be you know all the difference in the world
