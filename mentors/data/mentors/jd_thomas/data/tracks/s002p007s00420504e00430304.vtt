00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.650
one thing I would change about my job would probably be, um that would

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:12.450
 probably be the thief. Amount of stress that you have to deal with

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.250
 day in, day out. Um, I think it it weighs on, uh, everyone. I know it's

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:24.050
 different for everyone, but I just think the amount of stress that

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.850
 you have to deal with it causes, huh? I guess you could say unwarranted

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.650
 consequences. You know, things like high blood pressure, things

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.450
 like, you know, uh, sleep anxiety, you know, issues that, um, the

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.250
 average person would want a deal well with and shouldn't have to deal

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.050
 with. And I think some of these effects are felt by, you know, a

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.850
 lot of our leaders long after they retire.
