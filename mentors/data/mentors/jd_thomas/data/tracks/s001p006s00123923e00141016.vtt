00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.530
a SZ faras problems. You deal with just about anything that you can think

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:12.220
 of mainly personnel issues or admin issues. I think those who are

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.900
 like the big ones, um, the third would probably be material which

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.580
 in which things break. And you have to establish, like a priority in

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.270
 which, what problems get fixed first. And who do you have to fix? What

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.950
 problems Manning issues. We need these three people to go here,

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.630
 but we have this evolution going on over here. It's just your problems

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:46.310
 can range from personal and would say, sailors, family member, you

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:52.000
 know hasn't having some issues. And you have to literally like, you

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.680
 know, stop what you're doing to make sure that they're focused to

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.360
 do the job that they're supposed to do, as opposed to focusing on what's

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.050
 going on back home. So you have to be well, well rounded and well

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.730
 versed and very patient when it comes to dealing with a multitude

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:20.410
 of problems. Always tell people to be the be the eye of a storm. Basically,

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:26.100
 you know, stay call, think things through and do not react

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.780
 how you feel the most of the time
