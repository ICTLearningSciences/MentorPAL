00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.530
as far as problems you deal with just about anything that you can think

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:12.220
 of mainly personnel issues or admin issues I think those are like

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.900
 the the big ones the third would probably be material with somebody's

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.580
 things break and you have to establish like a priority and and which

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.270
 what problems get fixed first and who do you have to fix what problems

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.950
 manning issues we need these three people to go here but we have

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.630
 this evolution going on over here this is your problems can range

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:46.310
 from I was a personal and with say up of sailors family member you

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:52.000
 know hasn't having some issues and you have to literally like you know

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.680
 stop what you don't want to make sure that they're all focused to

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.360
 do the job that they're supposed to do as opposed to focus in on what's

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.050
 going on back home so you have to be well well rounded and well

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.730
 versed in very patient when it comes to dealing with a multitude of

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:20.410
 problems I always tell people to the the the the I have a storm basically

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:26.100
 you know stay call thank things through and do not really react

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.780
 how you feel the most of the time
