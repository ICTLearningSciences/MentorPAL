00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.770
 have mastered before at least attempted to would be add me. Uh, the

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:17.230
 Navy and the military in general is very ad man paperwork heavy.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.700
 So if you don't have a clear understanding of what what's required of

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.160
 you and how Thio managed that the admin side off being a leader, uh,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.620
 you're definitely going to struggle, so that's one skill I wish I

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.080
 would have mastered early on.
