00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.740
I'm sorry and experience that illuminates Navy culture. Um, I would say

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.630
 it's classic, and I'm pretty sure everyone experiences is this is

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.520
 Ah definitely would have to say, returning from a deployment say onboard

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.410
 like any any ship after a long period out of C. Uh so the general

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.300
 excitement among the crew and you know each other's It just kind

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.190
 of raises morale because you know you're going home. You know, everyone's

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:35.080
 kind of walking on like Cloud now, like the last couple of days,

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.970
 and it's almost like a kid going to Disney World for the first time

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.860
 the night before. It's like that kid and sleep is just so excited

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.750
 to read to go home. You know, you're just ready to see your family

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.630
 and friends. And, uh, that culture just kind of hits its peak the day

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.520
 off when everyone is putting on their dress whites. So the dress blues

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.410
 and we're getting already and pressed and everything is nice and,

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.300
 you know, you finally hear the the man the rails called on the one

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.190
 EMC, and that's how you know it's like you're going home. And I think

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.080
 that that culture kind of hits it hits its peak at that time toe

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.970
 where you're putting import and you and all your 300 of your closest

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.860
 friends are going home for the first time in seven or eight months

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.750
 on. And I think that just kind of, you know, that just sums up like

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.640
 Navy culture, right?
