00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.510
um, the big difference between working privacy you're in, like, say, is

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:12.160
 working in the military, uh, would be the for one the tempo to the

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.820
 stress level. And three, It's kind of tough to explain, but there is

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.470
 there in the military you you're always under like the watchful eye

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.130
 of something that I think that's the big thing. It's like you're you're

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.780
 always under the microscope when you're in the military. So everything

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.440
 that you say you do, you're being like scrutinized for you,

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.090
 man. Watch for, say, for example, incident happens out in town, and

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.750
 I'm in my uniform the difference between me being in that incident

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.400
 as a civilian between and now, you know, in my uniform it's looked at

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.060
 as, Hey, Naval Officer did X, y and Z. But if I was as a civilian,

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.710
 it'll just be J d. The this. You know, you represent a larger a group

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.370
 of people, a larger organization, I think that plays ah big part

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:20.020
 into a person's like a day to day operations as faras the differences,

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.680
 but also you get there. You know, there's like a a different, um,

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.330
 sense of. I guess you could say freedom as a civilian as opposed to

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.990
 being in the military. Because every day I think I like, Hey, I'll

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.640
 be I don't I won't be I won't be anywhere permanently So this is temporary

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.300
 for me, so I always have to go back to see I'll always be moving.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.950
 So it was just a few things that play into, You know, the difference

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.610
 is, I guess.
