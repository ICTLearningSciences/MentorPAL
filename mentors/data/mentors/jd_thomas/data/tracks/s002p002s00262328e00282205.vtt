00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.790
the big difference between work and private sector in like say he's working

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:12.730
 in the military would be the the four one the temple to the stress

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.660
 level and three it's kind of tough to explain but they're they're

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.600
 in the military you you're always underlying the watchful eye of

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.540
 something that's I think that's the big thing it's like you're you're

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:36.480
 always under the mac the microscope when you're in the military so

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.420
 everything that you say you do your band by scrutinize for your mail

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.350
 watch for say for example incident happens out in town and I'm in

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.290
 my uniform the difference between me and you been in that SO that as

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:00.230
 a civilian between and now you know in my uniform it's looked at as

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:06.170
 he naval officer did X. Y. Z. but if I was as a civilian it'll just

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.110
 be J. D. V. this you know you represent a larger group of people a

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.040
 larger organization and I think that plays a big part into a person's

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.980
 like day to day operations as far as the difference but also you get

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.920
 the you know there's like a a different since by guess you could

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.860
 say freedom as a civilian as opposed to being in the military because

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.800
 everyday out thing I like a I'll be I don't I won't be I won't be

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.730
 anywhere permanently so this is temporary for me so I always have to

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:53.670
 go back to see I'll always be moving so those just a few things that

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.610
 play into you know the difference is I guess
