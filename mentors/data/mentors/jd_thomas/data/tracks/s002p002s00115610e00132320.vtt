00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.970
council skills for a leader, I would definitely say, and I keep saying

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.100
 this one over and over its ability to empathize If you have to counsel

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.220
 a sailor, the first question you should ask yourself is, How would

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.340
 I want someone to approach me in the same situation if I were in

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.470
 that situation? And how you respond in your mind is nine times out of

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.590
 10 how you should respond to that sailor? So if you don't respond

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.710
 well to someone yelling and screaming at you, why would you yell and

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.840
 scream at a safe? If you don't respond well to some one person that

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.960
 you why would you curse satisfied in a council? The situation? Um,

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.090
 my thing was, in terms of Council of Sailors is a a quote man to man

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.210
 or man to woman sit down personal closed door conversation where we

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.330
 discussed what happened, why it happened, and the reasoning behind

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.460
 their behavior and how we fix that going forward and what I have to

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.580
 do in terms of being a leader going forward and what my expectations

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.700
 are of him or her moving forward. So the bottom line is you communicate

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.830
 and be respectful and empathize. I keep saying that you were in

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.950
 for that
