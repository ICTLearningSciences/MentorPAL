00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.160
so the things that you could prioritize first be what's important to you

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.470
 and what's important to your family. Those things are will make the

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.790
 difference in, ah, great duty station. Um, as far as like where you're

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:22.100
 going and what you'll be able to do, what you do in your off time.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.410
 The second thing is your job and your plant the platform that you're

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.730
 aspiring to go to, Um, I enjoy Didi G's s Oh, my preference would

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.040
 be like a ddg out of same Mayport. Um, and third would probably

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.350
 be the job. Like I mentioned before, I personally think that slows.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.660
 You know, you can do whatever job that's, you know that you're assigned

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.970
 to you, confined their strengths and weaknesses within these job

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.290
 and, you know, do it to the best of your ability. But of course, certain

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.600
 jobs are more demanding than others. And certain aspects say,

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.910
 for example, a chain of isil whips, you know, chain was responsible

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.230
 for the entire plant of proportion plant and, you know, some auxiliary,

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.540
 a lot of the auxiliary plants that actually run the ship so you

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.850
 know you'll be your job is a lot more demanding um so those things out

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.160
 prioritize would be You know what's more important to you as faras

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.470
 your location a SZ far as you do the station. And that's important

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.790
 to your family and platform that you will be working out of a DDG as

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.100
 opposed to a cruiser or an Anthea and what job you aspire to do.
