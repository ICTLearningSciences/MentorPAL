00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.160
so the things that are you could park prioritize first be what's important

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.470
 you know what's important to your family of those things are will

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.790
 make the difference and agreed to station as far as I where you're

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:22.100
 going to which would be able to do what you do in your off time second

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.410
 thing is your job and your plant the platform that your US firing

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.730
 to go to I enjoy DG's so my preference would be like a a DDG out

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.040
 of say made for and third would probably be the the job like I mentioned

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.350
 before I I personally thing as slow as you know you can do whatever

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.660
 job that you know that you're assigned to you can find the strengths

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.970
 and weaknesses with any job and you know do it to the best your

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.290
 best ability but of course certain jobs are more demanding than others

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.600
 and certain aspects say for example a chain by so whips you know

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.910
 change was responsible for the entire plan of propulsion plant and

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.230
 you know some auxiliary with a lot of the auxiliary plans that actually

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.540
 run the ship so you know you'll you'll be your job is a lot more

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.850
 demanding so those things our prioritize would be you know what's

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.160
 more important you as far as you know your location as far as a duty

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.470
 station you know and that support your family and platform it should

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.790
 be you know working out of a DTG as opposed to a cruiser or and and

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.100
 fear and what job you'll you'll spy to do
