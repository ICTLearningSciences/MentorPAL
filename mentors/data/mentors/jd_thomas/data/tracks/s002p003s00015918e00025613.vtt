00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.030
as a leader in my organization one important decision I face every day

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.200
 is to decide to get up and go to work every day and I think we we all

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.380
 are faced with that may be you know everyone has their bad days and

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.560
 you know sometimes you just you don't feel like doing you don't feel

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.740
 like you know but what makes the decision for me is the fact that

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.910
 there's a team of sailors all peers and even seniors that are somewhere

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.090
 so you know relying on me to you know help get them through the

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.270
 day I always like to believe that maybe there there's a sailor who's

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.450
 going through something and me not showing up at work that day could

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.620
 be the day that they feel like a temporary problem is a permanent

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.800
 problem and that's what importance is in make every day
