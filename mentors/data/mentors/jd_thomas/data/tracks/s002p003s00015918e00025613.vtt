00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.600
as a leader in my organization. One important decision I face every day

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.340
 is, uh, to decide to get up and go to work every day. And I think

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.090
 we we all are faced with that. Maybe, you know, everyone has their bad

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.830
 days, and, you know, sometimes you just you don't feel like doing.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.580
 You don't feel like, you know. But what makes the decision for me

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.320
 is the fact that there's a team of sailors or peers and even seniors

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.070
 that are somewhere so, you know, relying on me, too. You know, I helped

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.820
 get them through the day, always like to believe that maybe there

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.560
 there's a sailor who's going through something and me not strong

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.310
 up at work that day could be the day that they feel like a temporary

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.050
 problem is a permanent problem. And that's what an important decision

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.800
 I make every day
