00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.190
now that depends on the situation. If it's something said family emergency

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.540
 or, uh, you know, knock on wood. Ah, family member finds out there,

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.880
 or an immediate family member finds out that they're, you know,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.230
 say, you know, cancer stricken or something. My personal belief is

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.570
 that you express that that need in that issue early and often with your

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.920
 chain of command. And that's to ensure that the commanding officer

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.260
 understands the severity of the event. This highly depends on also

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.600
 the command schedule and the demands placed upon that command and

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.950
 your role within those are those operations. So express that need in

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.290
 that issue early and often. And explorer those options with the command.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.640
 I have not seen or experienced one command. Try it that does not

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.980
 do their best to work with the service member to ensure that they

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.330
 have time or the capacity to go home and, you know, be with the family

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.670
 member. What do what do you know? Provide as much support as they

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.020
 can? On the other hand, in situations where say, a spouse has opportunity

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.360
 of a lifetime thio take, you know, advantage of a a job opportunity.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.700
 Um, I hate to say it, but that your spouse is your mistress

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.050
 in reality, and the Navy is your your your husband or your wife at

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.390
 the time, you know. So you it'll probably be best for you and your wife,

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.740
 your your spouse to work. That that situation out, they may have

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.080
 to. You may have to Geo batch While they move. She may, he or she

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.430
 may not be able to take that position is just something that you have

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.770
 to work out with your signature significant other.
