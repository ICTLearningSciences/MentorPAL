00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.190
now that depends on the situation if it's something set family emergency

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.540
 or a you know you know knock on wood a family member you know if

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.880
 I was out there or or an immediate family member found out that there

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.230
 you know save you know cancer stricken or something my personal belief

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.570
 is that you express that that needed that issue early and often

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.920
 with your chain of command and that's the to ensure that the commanding

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.260
 officer understands the severity of of the event this Holly depends

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.600
 on also the command schedule and the demands placed upon it command

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.950
 and your role within those those operations so expressed that needed

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.290
 to issue early and often and explore those options with the command

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.640

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.980

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.330
 have time or the ask you to go home and you know be with the family

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.670
 member do what do you know provide as much support as they came on

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.020
 the other hand in situations where say a spouse has the opportunity

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.360
 of a lifetime to take you know advantage of a a a job opportunity

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.700
 I hate to say it but that your spouse is your mistress and and reality

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.050
 and the navy is your your your husband or your wife at the time you

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.390

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.740
 your spouse to work that that situation they may have to you may have

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.080
