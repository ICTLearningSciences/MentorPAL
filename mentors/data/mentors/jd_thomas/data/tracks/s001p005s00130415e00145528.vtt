00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.140
are so of four person entering this feel our I'll give you three priorities

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.430
 the first and these are from one to three of it may sound counterintuitive

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.730
 or kind of backwards but we hear me out first priority

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.020
 will be self care you always have to take care of this so so physically

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.310
 mentally emotionally spiritually financially all five of those things

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.600
 ours you should take those into account when and in terms of these

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.900
 for hours number two will be your family and friends your family

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.190
 friends or allow you for support Seoul be there for them as best you

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.480
 can with the time that you have don't neglect of don't push them

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.770
 away if you have issues with them more problems of March each other

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.070
 do your best to work out those conflicts a move for your time on here

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.360
 on land with them is limited so you always have to be a C. ships will

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.650
 be at sea ships will operate so your time is limited so spend what

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.940
 time you have with your family and friends and you know joyous occasions

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.240
 are number three in terms of navy number three is navy of the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.530
 navy as a third priority in my book simply because you can't take

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.820
 care of the navy if you don't first take care of yourself and to take

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.110
 care of your family if you don't take care of number one numbers one

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.410
 and two your focus will not be on the navy's mission so prioritize

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.700
 those three our front door I prioritize those three like that yeah

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.990
