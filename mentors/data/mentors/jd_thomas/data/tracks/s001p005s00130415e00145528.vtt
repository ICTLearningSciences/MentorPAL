00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.140
all right. So for person entering this field, I'll give you three priorities.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.430
 The first and these are from 1 to 3. It may sound counterintuitive

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.730
 or kind of backwards, but you hear me out, the first priority

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.020
 will be self care. You always have to take care of yourself so physically,

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.310
 Mentally, emotionally, spiritually, financially. All five of

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.600
 those things are you should take those into account. Um when in terms

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.900
 of these powers, number two will be your family and friends, Your

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.190
 family and friends were allowing you for support. So be there for them

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.480
 as best you can. With the time that you have. Don't neglect him.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.770
 Don't push them away. If you have issues with them or problems amongst

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.070
 each other, do your best to work out those conflicts and move forward.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.360
 Your time on here on land with them is limited. So you always

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.650
 have to be a sea Ships will be at sea. Ships will operate so your time

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.940
 is limited. So spend what time you have with your family and friends

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.240
 and you know, joyous occasions. Number three in terms of Navy number

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.530
 three is navy. The Navy is 1/3 priority in my book simply because

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.820
 you can't take care of the Navy if you don't first take care of

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.110
 yourself and to take care of your family. If you don't take care of

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.410
 number, want numbers one and two. Your focus will not be on the Navy's

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.700
 mission, so prioritize those three. I'll fry Tito. I prioritize those

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.990
 three like that. Um, yeah.
