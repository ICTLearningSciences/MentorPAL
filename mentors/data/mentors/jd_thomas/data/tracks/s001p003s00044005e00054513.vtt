00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.770
home. Life was amazing. Of course, like any any family, my family went

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.680
 through some rough patches. You know, we had some deaths in the family

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.600
 that caused, like, a huge ripple effect throughout, but at the same

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.520
 time, we were family. So, you know, we're stuck together and just

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.430
 kind of rode the wave out. But my childhood was awesome. My adolescence

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.350
 period was awesome. My adult life was awesome. Every trial and

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.260
 tribulation that you go through, you just kind of look at it as a learning

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.180
 experience and how to get better. Better. So I have nothing

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.100
 but great memories and, you know, positive things to say about the people

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.010
 that I grew up around and the people that, you know, I had the

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.930
 experience.
