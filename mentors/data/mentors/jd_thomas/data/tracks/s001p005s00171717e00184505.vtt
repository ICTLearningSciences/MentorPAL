as you progress in your career you'll be privileged to more information

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.190
 and yes that's important in a sense but not in the sense that you

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.360
 may think of the key here will be too is how do you discern what to

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.530
 relay and what not to relate to your peers and to your family and to

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.700
 your sailors so you may be on to some very you know secret squirrel

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.870
 mission or whatever it may be wherever it may be and you'll have to

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:37.040

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.710
 it may be in order to I don't know accomplish some mission somewhere

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.880
 there now I work a little bit more at it now we're just a little

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.050
 bit more heart I'll be a little bit more attention to so you as a leader

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.220
 we have to find that balance of how to motivate how to keep your

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.390
 sailor's and your peers motivated but at the same time not given them

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.560
 up I love not given too much information to where it may be a issue

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.730
 going for
