00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.020
as you progress in your career, you'll be privileged to Maur, um, information.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.190
 And yes, that's important, in a sense, but not in the sense

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.360
 that you may think of. Of the key here will be, too, is how do you

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.530
 discern what to relay and what not relate to your peers and to your

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.700
 family and to your sailors. So you may be on some very secret squirrel

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.870
 mission or whatever it may be wherever it may be, and you'll have

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:37.040
 to understand what to say and what not to say to these people because,

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.210
 you know, let's face it, we all work better when we know what we're

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.370
 what when we know what we're doing and why we're doing so if I understand

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.540
 that, Hey, I'm doing, I'm fixing this whatever piece of equipment

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.710
 it maybe in order to, uh, I don't know, accomplished some mission

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.880
 somewhere. Then I'll work a little bit more at it. I work just

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.050
 a little bit more hard. I'll pay a little bit more attention to it,

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.220
 so you, as a leader, will have to find that balance of how to motivate

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.390
 how to keep your sailors and your peers motivated. But at the same

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.560
 time not giving him up enough, not giving him too much information

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.730
 toe where it may be, ah, issue going forward.
