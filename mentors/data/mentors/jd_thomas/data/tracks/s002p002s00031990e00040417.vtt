00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.280
in order, Teoh build trust among team members. That kind of relies on

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.700
 you as a leader but also being able to communicate with the more senior

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.130
 leaders and even the most senior leaders. But the more senior team

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.560
 members and the team members that have been there the longest. So

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.980
 it's not all on you. Excuse me, It's not all on you. It's amongst each

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.410
 other. So established that culture of trusting and developing each

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.840
 other and it'll trickle down. The trickle down effect will occur

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.270
 and you will go through some some bumps in the road. But that's up to

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.690
 you. Toe. Establish that communication amongst those the parties of

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.120
 all involved.
