00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.970
There's a few things that I feel that a person should know about themselves

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.090
 proud to lead a team or even when leading a team. And that one

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.210
 is to know who they are, two to know where they're from. And three,

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:21.340
 um, how to empathize that 1st 1 Knowing who you are, sailors of smart

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.460
 people. We pick up on a lot of things. We observe and watch a lot.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.580
 So if you're if you dodge herself, you aren't shoe sure about yourself

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.700
 as a person, and that makes me believe that you aren't fit to lead

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.820
 me into any situation, to know where you're from. I like to believe

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.940
 that a person's family and their friends and their background pays

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.060
 a lot of big, far into their leadership and who they are as a person.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.180
 So I'd liketo think that I conduct myself in a manner that my grandmother

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.310
 or my mother, my dad and my grandfather would approval if

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.430
 he saw me interacting with and leading a team being able to advertise.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.550
 I think that's just a part of, you know, just daily living in interacting

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.670
 with each other
