00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.970
there's a few things that I feel that a person should know about or sales

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.090
 prior to lead a team or even Willie today and asked one is to know

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.210
 who they are to to know where they're from and three how to improvise

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:21.340
 the first one of knowing who you are those sailors a smart people

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.460
 I would pick up on a lot of things we observe a watch a lot so if

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.580
 you're if you doubt yourself in your shoes sure about yourself as a

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.700
 person and that makes me believe that you are fit to lead me into any

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.820
 situation to know where you're from I like to believe that a a person's

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.940
 family and their friends and their background pays a lot of big

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.060
 part into their leadership and who they are as a person so I like

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.180
 to think that I conduct myself in a manner that my grandmother or my

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.310
 mother or my dad or my my grandfather would approve of if you saw

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.430
 me interacting with and leading a team been able to empathize I think

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.550
 there's just a part of a you know just daily living of in interacting

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.670
 with each other
