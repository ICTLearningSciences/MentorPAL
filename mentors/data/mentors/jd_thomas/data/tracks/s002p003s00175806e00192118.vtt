00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.390
so in terms of conduct issues Ah, a lot of it is is written in black and

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.930
 white. Um, I would venture to say that to maintain team cohesion,

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.470
 cohesion within your division, I will be best to handle do your best

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.020
 of handles, small issues of certain issues didn't with conduct in

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.560
 house. And as a division officer, you are able to do that. I would also

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.100
 say to cover yourself by putting it on paper. It doesn't really,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.640
 you know, hurt someone toe right, Someone up for conduct issue. That's

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.180
 no problem. But other issues such as, ah, say a sexual assault or

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.720
 a you know, a physical altercation. Things of that nature of, um or

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.260
 er Oh, I guess you could say on a higher magnitude you were definitely

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.800
 Take that up. The chain of command. It's also safe to say, if you're

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.350
 not sure, ask someone you're not leading a division alone. You

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.890
 have assistance. You have piers. You have ah department here, XO ASIO.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.430
 So if you're not sure it doesn't hurt to go to someone and seek

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.970
 help. Usual. Resource is is what I'm saying.
