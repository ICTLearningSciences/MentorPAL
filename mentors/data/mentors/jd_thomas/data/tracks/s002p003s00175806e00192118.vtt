00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.390
so in terms of conduct issues are a lot of it is is is written in black

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.930
 or white I'm I would venture to say that to are maintained team could

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.470
 he cohesion within the you know your division I would be best to

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.020
 handle do your best to handles small issues a certain issues then with

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.560
 conduct in house and as a division officer you're able to do that

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.100
 I would also say to cover yourself out put it on paper it doesn't

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.640
 really you know heard someone tell right someone up for conduct issue

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.180
 that's no problem but other issues such as a say a sexual assault

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.720
 or a you know a physical altercation things of that nature of a more

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.260
 of a I guess you could say on on a higher magnet to you would definitely

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.800
 take that up the chain of command this also safe to say Hey if

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.350
 you're not sure asked someone you're not leading a division alone you

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.890
 have assistance you have peers you have a department head all XO

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.430
 see also if you're not sure it's it doesn't hurt to go to someone and

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.970
 and see him user resources is what I'm saying
