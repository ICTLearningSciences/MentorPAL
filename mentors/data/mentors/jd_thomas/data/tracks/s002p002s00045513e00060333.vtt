good strategies would be to again empathize. I typically would make routine

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.590
 rounds with the team, so I would come in, you know, in the morning,

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.460
 right before lunch after lunch sometime in the evening and be

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.340
 present during special evolutions. If you know your your team has, say,

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.210
 evolution to training evolution, you might want to be around for

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.080
 Be around for the meetings. Bill around. Just be there. Be be around.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.950
 It adds your input when it's needed. Sometimes you'll have toe play.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.820
 What I call would be the sword in the shield. Well, they might need

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.690
 someone to speak up for them to a senior, And you might be there

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.560
 might be that guy to take the sword and go out and do what you need

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.440
 to do and speak for them. But at the same time, if something happens,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.310
 that's, um, like, not so good for your your team as, say, a training

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.180
 evolution didn't go is playing. You need to be there to defend them,

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.050
 but how would you defend him if you're not there?
