00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.550
to ensure that your your family's taken care of it. It's all about planning

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.250
 and thinking, thinking ahead. Eso you think about the things that

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.960
 you typically do day in and day out that will not be done if you

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.660
 aren't there. So, uh, I personally I'm a big fan of, say, auto pay.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.360
 So a lot of the house bills, especially being a single guy. So my bills

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.060
 are on auto pay, which allow them to be paid. They want some more

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.760
 and it just come out regularly. So it was really just me not being

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.460
 there. Is the difference as far as your family? Definitely the communication

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.170
 needs to be. It needs to be had early and often about Hey,

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.870
 who's gonna do this or who's going to do that? Try to get down the

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.570
 schedule of say what your spouse and say, Hey, you know, here's when

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.270
 the oil needs to be changed in the truck or hears when I typically

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.970
 take out the trash. Or here's when I typically do this on also offer.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.670
 Resource is for that person to reach out to for assistance if they

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.380
 need, you know the arm Bussmann as faras the command. Other spouses

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.080
 around the command that are are being left as well. Because you're

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.780
 not alone. You're not going out to sea by yourself. So reach out to

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.480
 the other wives or, say husbands that are home and who have more experience

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.180
 than you do when dealing with things like that, and they'll

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.880
 give you other opportunities. And resource is for you to reach out.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.590
 Um, say, if you're having, like, trouble picking up the keys from school

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.290
 or something like that, So those things that I typically think

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.990
 about
