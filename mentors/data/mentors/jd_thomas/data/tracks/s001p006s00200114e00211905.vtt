on a typical year of travel basically depends on whether you're all sea

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.840
 duty shore duty my shore duty pharmacy duty I would say I was going

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.830
 probably nine months out of twelve with will in three patrols which

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.820
 for about three months each and the one mall that we would have in

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.820
 port was spent preparing to go back out to sea so you definitely traveled

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.810
 a lot I went to probably maybe seven or eight different countries

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:42.800
 we went to a lot of different ports it was definitely a fun experience

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.790
 it was an awesome experience stressful a lot of work but you

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.790
 know we went to places like Korea South Korea Malaysia don't forget

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.780

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.770

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.770
