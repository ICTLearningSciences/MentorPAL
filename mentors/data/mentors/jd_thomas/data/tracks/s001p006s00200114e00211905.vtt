in a typical year. Travel basically depends on whether you're on sea duty,

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.840
 on shore duty, my shore duty or Mitzi Duty. I would say I was going

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.830
 probably nine months out of 12. We went on three patrols, which

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.820
 were about three months each, and the one month that we would have

 a couple names. You don't want to a place a few places in South

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.770
 Japan. Afterwards, we traveled toe. Why San Diego Mexico stopped

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.770
 in a few places to refuel, even went to a small island called Cy Pain,

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.760
