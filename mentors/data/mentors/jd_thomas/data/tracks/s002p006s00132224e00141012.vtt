00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.640
in some ways, Yes. And in some ways, no. Um, just a tidbit. You're always

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.430
 subordinate to somewhere you always have a boss. So, uh, in the

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.210
 past, in the past two commands, of course, I worked for a commander

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.000
 and a captain. So your schedule was dictated by the captain. Schedule

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.790
 the Commodore schedule. So if he wanted you at work before he got

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.580
 to work and you had all to your schedule if you didn't mind you going

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.370
 home after your work was done, say, at 2 33 o'clock. Ah, that altered

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.150
 your schedule. So you kind of you're at the mercy of this while

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.940
 you're at the mercy of demands that are placed upon you by by the command

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.730
 and by the schedule.
