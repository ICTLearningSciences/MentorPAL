00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.980
um, my biggest weakness used to be wearing my emotions on my sleeve. I'm

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.120
 very I'm a very personable person. I'm a very, uh, caring, empathetic

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.250
 person. So it was easy for someone to learned how to push my buds.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.380
 Eso saying certain things, doing certain names that they knew would

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.510
 agitate me or get me fired up. Then it was easy to figure that out.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.650
 So wearing my emotions on my sleeve was probably the biggest weakness

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.780
 I my Achilles heel.
