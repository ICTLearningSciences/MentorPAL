00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.080
things that encourage accountability are, um, one of my favorites. This

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.300
 would be ownership. So throughout your command, throughout your division,

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.530
 throughout your department and even, you know, just in general,

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.760
 people respond better when they feel as if they own something. And

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.980
 that simple notion will encourage someone to be accountable for their

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.210
 equipment before a program. So throughout your team to develop

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.440
 or encourage accountability would be to give a sailor program and sit

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.660
 down and communicate with them your expectations and your standards

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.890
 and encourage them to make this program the best or, you know, to

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.110
 pass an expectation, you know, whatever it may be. But that sense of

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.340
 ownership encourages accountability alone. But you just have to be

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.570
 the leader to find that that that sailor, that you can apply to that

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.790
 program, Teoh, you know, move for so ownership encourages accountability

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.020
 in my pain
