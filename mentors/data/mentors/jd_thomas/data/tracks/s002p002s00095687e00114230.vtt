00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.640
I think that depends on the person that depends on you. Um though is there

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.430
 is no no one one size fits all type thing. So you can't say with

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.230
 this type of person. I'm gonna do this with this type of person. I'm

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.020
 going to do that. You have Teoh, learn and you know, just kind of

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.810
 gain that experience by doing it. You won't be successful in every

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.600
 matter, but what you can do is communicate. You can sit down with the

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.400
 sailor and say, Hey, you know I'm trying. Teoh established this kind

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.190
 of culture. I'm trying to do X, Y and Z and respond to feedback.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.980
 That's the big thing. Communicate and responding feedback. So if you

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.770
 see something is not working with a certain sailor, try something different.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.560
 What's the worst that could happen if you go talk to someone?

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.360
 Really Nothing. So communicate. Sit down and talk with. That's how

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.150
 you That's how you move forward. That's how you deal with a wide

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.940
 multitude of people. You communicate, you listen. You observe, watch

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.730
 how they respond to you. When you say certain things, watch how they

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.530
 respond with starting other things happen. For example, I knew certain

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.320
 sailors didn't, you know, respond well to me screaming and yelling

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.110
 or, you know, just being very playful or something. So you wouldn't

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.900
 be that way with that sailor. You know what I mean? You just have

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.700
 to respond accordingly. So but always, uh, observe and listen more

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.490
 than you speak and follow their verbal and nonverbal cues. That's basically

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.280
 it.
