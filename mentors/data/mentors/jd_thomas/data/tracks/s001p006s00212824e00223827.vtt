00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.690
was not to love about my job I think the big three things that come to

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.520
 mind would be the experience and guidance that you offer that you're

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.360
 able to offer a fellow sailors and that would be you know subordinates

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.190
 peers and sometimes even seniors you know outside of that the travel

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:30.030
 I've been and been to places and I've seen things that you know

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.860
 my parents will never see have never seen I think it's helped me grow

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.700
 as a person tremendously another thing would probably be the the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.540
 the benefits that come with being a you know servicemen the the pay

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.370
 not to mention the career development but also the opportunities that

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.210
 you know come with you know being a a and a sailor which would be

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.040
 you know the networking opportunities been able to you know have friends

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.880
