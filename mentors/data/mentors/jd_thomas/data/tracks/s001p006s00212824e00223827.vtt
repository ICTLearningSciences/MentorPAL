00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.690
was not to love about my job. I think the big three things that come to

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.520
 mind would be the experience and guidance that you offer that you're

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.360
 able to offer fellow sailors. And that would be, you know, subordinates,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.190
 peers and sometimes even seniors. You know, outside of that

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:30.030
 the travel I've been and been to places and I've seen things that you

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.860
 know my parents will never see have never seen. I think it's helped

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.700
 me grow as a person tremendously. Another thing would probably be

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.540
 the benefits that come with being a serviceman. The pay not to mention,

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.370
 uh, the, um, career development, but also the opportunities that

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.210
 come with being a sailor, which would be, you know, the networking

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.040
 opportunities being able to, you know, I have friends all over the world,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.880
 family, all of the world.
