00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.070
so I would say that my career is kind of unique over the past eight years,

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.300
 I think I've moved maybe four or five times, and that's I think

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.520
 that's a unique situation. Prior to being commissioned Officer, I was

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.740
 enlisted as a undesignated airman for two years in Jacksonville.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.970
 After earning my Camilo after applying O. C. S, I was given opportunity

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.190
 to earn my commission, which meant I had to move to Rhode Island.

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:37.410
 I was a earned my commission as a naval flight officer, so I left

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.640
 Rhode Island and went to Pensacola. I was down in Pensacola for about

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.860
 eight months in which I was tried it from flight school for a number

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.080
 of issues. I left went to San Diego for training in San Diego six

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.310
 months. So after their being in San Diego for six months of me and

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.530
 redesignated as a swot, I left for Japan for 20 months. So I was in

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.750
 Japan 20 months, and then my tour ended, and then I ended up back in

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.970
 Jacksonville as a surface warfare office on a desk downstairs, and

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.200
 I was there for two years after Ben and Jacksonville for two years.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.420
 I left, and now I'm here in California. So the rolls were a lot different.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.640
 The demands were a lot different. But if you approach it your

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.870
 day almost you approach the day almost the same. It depends on the

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.090
 demands that are set upon the command and what the commanding officer

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.310
 expects out of his staff and his ship. So a lot of times, the commanding

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.540
 officer kind of dictates how ah, persons or his sailors days

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.760
 go his or her sailors Day goes.
