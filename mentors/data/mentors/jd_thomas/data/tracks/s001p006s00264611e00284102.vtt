00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.070
sold I would say that my career is kind of a unique over the past eight

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.300
 years I think I've moved may be four five times and that's I think

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.520
 that's a unique situation prior to being commission officer I was listed

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.740
 as a under is made airman for two years in Jacksonville after

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.970
 our democracy or after applying OCS I'll was you know give an opportunity

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.190
 to earn my commission which meant I had to move to Rhode Island

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:37.410
 I was a are my commission as a naval flight officers so I left Rhode

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.640
 Island and went to Pensacola I was down in Pensacola for about eight

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.860
 months in which you know was a try to from flight school for a number

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.080
 of issues I left when the San Diego for trying to thousand San

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.310
 Diego six months so after being a San Diego for six months of me every

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.530
 doesn't it as a slow I live for Japan for twenty months sounds very

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.750
 twenty months and then my tour in it and then I ended up back in

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.970
 Jacksonville as a serves warfare office on does Ross there and I was

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.200
 there for two years after been in Jacksonville for two years left

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.420
 and now I'm here in California so the roles were a lot different the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.640
 demands were a lot different but if you approach it your daily almost

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.870
 today almost the same it depends on the demands that are set upon

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.090
 the command and what the commanding officer expects out of his staff

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.310
 and his ship so a lot of times the commanding officer kind of dictates

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.540
 how a persons or a a his sailors days ago his or her sailors daily

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.760
