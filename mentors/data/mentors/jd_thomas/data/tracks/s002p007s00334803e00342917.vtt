How do I sure that board work gets done will. Basically, um, it's all

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.140
 about attention to detail whenever you're doing a job or a task. Just

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.280
 remember that your name is tired to that. And how do you want your

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.420
 name to be represented by the work that you've done so? Pay attention

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.560
 to detail board work. If it takes longer than, say, an hour or maybe

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.710
 even 30 minutes every so often, take a break. Relax your eyes. Stand

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.850
 up, stretch refocused. Take a walk around the ship, Come back,

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.990
 you know, refocus your eyes and pick up where you left off.
