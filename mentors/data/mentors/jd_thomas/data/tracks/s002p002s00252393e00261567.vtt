00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.020
um, it's a working with saying Isn't working with movies is totally different.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.200
 Civilians are mawr relaxed. They're more casual. There are

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.370
 peaceful sailors are at times very high, strong because they're so used

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.550
 to operating under certain environments. And that's kind of like

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.720
 how well, we're kind of compare it to like a yin and the Yang there's

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.890
 like Ah, hi, strong, you know, Go, go, go, go, go sailor mentality.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.070
 But then, on the civilian side, it's kind of like a slow down back

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.240
 it down. Here's what we need to do. So it z awesome working with severe

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.420
 and I think that's just a big difference is just the tempo that

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.590
 we operate on.
