00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.830
So this one is a tough question to deal with emotionally from it from

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.800
 an emotional standpoint. But here you have to think about you know,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.780
 things logically, like you're not all. You may not always be there for

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.750
 your family. You were in your war fighter and, you know, war, state

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.730
 place and things do happen. Also, training accidents do happen, and

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.710
 not as frequently as they used to. But, you know, things happen where

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.680
 sometimes sailors don't come home. So you have to play for for

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.660
 the worst, you have to always hope for the best, but plan for the worst,

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.630
 and that being you not come home. So, um, another tidbit for me

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.610
 is to invest in additional life insurance early, early you are, Which

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.580
 kind of correlates to you being in better shape. The younger you

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.560
 are, the lower that you'll pay monthly for additional life insurance.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.540
 So, of course, the, uh, what's provided for us is I think it's almost

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.510
 30 bucks. Monthly is the SDO lie, which gives us $400,000 or gives

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.490
 your family $400,000 of life insurance and event. Something happens

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.460
 to you while you're out service But banks like Navy, Federal and

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.440
 USA have life insurance, additional life insurance policies, which are

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.420
 term life insurance policy and whole life insurance policies. Where

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.390
 in the event something happens to you while you're active duty, you

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.370
 can receive up to an additional. Um, I guess, you know, somewhere

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.340
 along the lines of, like, 1/2 a $1,000,000 for, uh, for your family

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.320
 and event, something happens for you to you, Um, with these policies,

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.300
 especially on the USA, because I have two additional with us A a

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.270
 term in the whole life. Uh, what happens is I pay them monthly premium

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.250
 for both life insurance policies. And in the event, something happens

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.220
 to me. My beneficiaries will receive, you know, lump sums of money

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.200
 in addition to the Stu alive. Now, you might ask the question. What

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.170
 happens if I retirement? We're not retired. Do I lose the SD alive?

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.150
 Well, yes, you do. But when you retire with your own life insurance

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.130
 policies, especially through a U. S. A. That money, the money's

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.100
 that you have through this year, lie will roll over and to some of these

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.080
 policies that you get through your say so you, don't you lose that

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.050
 $400,000? So that's something. Another thing for you to think about

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.030
 as a say, a husband or father.
