00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.830
so this one is is a tough question to deal with emotionally from a from

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.800
 an emotional standpoint but here you have to think about you know

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.780
 think logically lie you're not all you may not always be there for your

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.750
 family on your in your war fighter and you know wars take place

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.730
 and things do happen also train accidents do happen and not as frequently

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.710
 as they used to but you know things happen we're sometimes sailors

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.680
 don't come home so you have to play in for for the worse you have

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.660
 to you always hope for the best plan for the worse and that being

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.630
 you not come home so another to bid for me is to invest in additional

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.610
 life insurance early on the early you are which kind of correlates

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.580
 to you've been in better shape the younger you are the lower that

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.560
 you'll pay monthly for additional life insurance so of course the was

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.540
 provided for us is I think it's almost thirty Bucks monthly is the

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.510
 S. July which gives us four hundred thousand dollars will give your

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.490
 family four hundred thousand dollars of life insurance in the event

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.460
 something happens to you while you're you're out service but banks

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.440
 like maybe federal and USA eighty have life insurance additional life

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.420
 insurance policies which are term life insurance policy in whole life

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.390
 insurance policies where in the event something happens to you while

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.370
 you're active duty you can receive up to an additional I guess

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.340
 you know somewhere along the lines of like a half a million dollars

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.320
 for for your family and invest something happens for you to you the

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.300
 with these are policies specially of your say because I have two additional

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.270
 with USA a term in a whole life what happens is I pay them a

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.250
 monthly premium for both life insurance policies and in the event something

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.220
 happens to me my beneficiaries will receive you know blossoms

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.200
 of money in addition to the issue alive now you might ask a question

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.170
 on what what happens if I retirement will not retire do I lose they're

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.150
 still alive well yes you do but when you retire with your own

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.130
 life insurance policies especially through USA Hey that money's the

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.100
 monies that you have to the issue alive will roll over into some of

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.080
 these policies that you get through USA a so you don't you lose that

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.050
 four hundred thousand dollars so that's something the another thing

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.030
 for you to think about as a say a husband or father
