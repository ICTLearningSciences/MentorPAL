00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.390
The most difficult part is all my training would probably be being away

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.940
 from my friends and family. Um, I'm a very, uh loving, caring, family

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.480
 oriented person, so there interact my interaction with them daily.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.020
 Weekly monthly, however it may be, plays a lot into my my psyche,

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.560
 so not being able to communicate with them as often as I like early

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.110
 on played a big part of it was very difficult for me to, uh, um, like,

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.650
 operate throughout training or conduct myself throughout training.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.190
 But it's a part of the job being in this career path. You spend days,

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.730
 weeks, maybe even months without seeing you're seeing or being

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.280
 able to converse with your family and friends. So as time goes on, you

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.820
 learn to manage and you learn to deal with it.
