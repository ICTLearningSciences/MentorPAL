00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.730
 a we're about to leave port for patrol and I was having the

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.600
 ready for the patrol but there was some of our equipment was

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:33.040
 down on the pier and at that moment you know my department here was

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.480
 headed down to our work center to express his displeasure with parts

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:11.670
 of my superior in order to move all
