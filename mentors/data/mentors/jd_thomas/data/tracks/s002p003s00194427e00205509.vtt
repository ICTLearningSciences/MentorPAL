00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.750
um I would definitely meant go out to say that on my first ship. Um, we

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.650
 were definitely were about thio leave port for patrol. And I was having

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.550
 issue personnel issues and I was trying Thio doing my best. Thio,

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.460

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.360
 our equipment was down on the pier, and at that moment, you know, my

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.260
 department here was headed down toe I work center Thio express his

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.160
 displeasure with parts of being on the pier and how we should redirect

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.060
 our efforts to get those parts often appear before we left for the

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.960
 patrol with the next day. And, uh, that was just one situation and

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.870
 where my priorities and my divisions priorities have to take a back

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.770
 seat way had to satisfy the needs of my superior in order to move on
