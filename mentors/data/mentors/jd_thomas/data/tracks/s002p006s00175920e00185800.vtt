00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.750
the biggest and best approach I can say is you have that conversation

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.650
 with your spouse and your family early and often that no one knows the

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.550
 needs of you and your family better than you and your family so when

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.450
 you're searching for a duty station you know you try to find that

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.350
 balance of what the navy needs and what the navy wants and what you

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.250
 want and what your family wants for you as far as how to you know

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.150
 progress towards the future so once you develop those four five things

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.050
 that are important to you go out and you find a duty station and

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.950
 an area within a duty station that you know me Stolz demands and you

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.850
 you basically you know express how you feel and what you want it's

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.750
 simple and what you have to be open to other or secondary and tertiary

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.650
 options also
