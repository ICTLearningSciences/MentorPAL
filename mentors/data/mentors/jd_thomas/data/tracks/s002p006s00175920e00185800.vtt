00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.750
um, the biggest and best approach I could say is you have that conversation

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.650
 with your spouse and your family early and often. Um, no one knows

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.550
 the needs off you and your family better than you and your family.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.450
 So when you're searching for your duty station, you know, you try

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.350
 to find that balance off what the Navy needs and what the Navy wants

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.250
 and what you want and what your family wants for you as faras how

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.150
 to, you know, progress towards the future. So once you develop those

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.050
 four or five things that are important to you go out and you find

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.950
 a duty station in an area within that dude ization that, you know, meet

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.850
 those demands and you basically, you know, express how you feel

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.750
 and what you want. It's simple, Um, but you have to be open to, uh,

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.650
 other or secondary and tertiary options also,
