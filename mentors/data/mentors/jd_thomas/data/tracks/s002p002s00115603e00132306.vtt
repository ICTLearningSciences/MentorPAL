00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.970
counseling skills for a leader, I would definitely say, and I keep saying

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.090
 this one over and over his ability to empathize. If you have to

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.210
 counsel a sailor, the first question you should ask yourself is, How

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:21.330
 would I want someone to approach me in the same situation if I were

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.450
 in that sense? And how you respond in your mind is nine times out of

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.570
 10 how you should respond to that sailor? So if you don't respond

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.690
 well to someone yelling and screaming at you, why would you yell and

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.810
 scream at a sale? If you don't respond well to someone cursing at you,

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.920
 why would you curse satisfied in a council? The situation? Um, my

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.040
 thing was, in terms of Council of Sailors is a a quote man to man

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.160
 or man to woman sit down personal closed door conversation where we

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.280
 discussed what happened, why it happened and the reasoning behind their

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.400
 behavior and how we fixed that going forward and what I have to

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.520
 do in terms of being a leader going forward and what my expectations

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.640
 are of him or her moving forward. So the bottom line is you communicate

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.760
 and be respectful and empathize. I keep saying that you were in

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.880
 for that
