00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.290
our counselors kill for later I would definitely say can I keep saying

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.730
 this one over and over instability to empathize if you have to counsel

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.170
 a sailor first question you should ask yourself is how would I want

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.610
 someone to approach me in the same situation if our this is was

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.050
 and how you respond in your mind is nine times out of ten of how you

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.490
 should respond to this so if you don't respond well to someone yelling

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.930
 and screaming at you why would you yell and scream out of sight

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.360
 if you don't respond well to someone person that you why would you curse

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.800
 at side an account of the situation my thing was in terms of counselling

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.240
 sailors is a a cold man to man or man to woman sit down personal

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.680
 closed door conversation where we discuss what happened why it

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.120
 happened and the reasoning behind their behavior and how we fix that

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.560
 going forward and what I have to do in terms of being a leader going

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.000
 for and what my expectations are of him or her move for so the bottom

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.440
 line is you communicate and be respectful empathize I keep saying

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.880
 that you were in for that
