00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.880
one situation comes to mind when I think about in ethical decision I had

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.910
 to make and that stem from the USS warship where there was a a young

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.940
 it listed you know sailor who had come to me one day and told me

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.970
 about a situation she was being approached by one of the one of my

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.010
 fellow G. offices and he was making advances on and she expressed the

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.040
 you know her her feelings that she didn't want the advances and that

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.070
 she didn't want him to get in trouble and that he had touched or

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.100
 anything he was just pushing up on and had done a few times and she

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.130
 wanted to bring that to someone's attention west he didn't want to she

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.160
 didn't want to get him in trouble so I told her I talk to and I wanted

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.190
 her to keep me in the loop if some were to happen because you

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.220
 know I would take it up the same to me so I don't calling him you know

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.250
 on the ship on Monday and ask them to come talk to me and so he proceeded

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.280
 to do so and you know I told him you know what I had been you

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.320
 know told and that he shouldn't do you know you know proceed any

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.350
 further you know the stopping here and he can agree to it and also say

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.380
 it kind of you know agree to it so I form my immediate supervisor

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.410
 and you know we just kind of moved on from there will he proceeded

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.440
 to continue to advance is and you drive it up take it up the chain of

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.470
 command sometime later but the time between I me initially known about

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.500
 it and between me take it up to command had been about two months

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.530
 so I ended up getting a little trouble behind it and looking back

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.560
 off I don't know if I would handle it any differently because I felt

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.600
 like I was doing the right thing by handling the situation at the

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.630
 lowest level than on other other hand I would say that there was a situation

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.660
 where I should have just taken it of the ten commandments you

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.690
 know so it's kind of a lot you know battle with that even today
