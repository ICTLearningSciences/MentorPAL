WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.710
um, one situation comes to mind when I think about unethical decision.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.570
 I had to make that stem from U. S s far ship where there was a, um,

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.420
 a young enlisted, you know, sailor who had come to me one day and told

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.280
 me about a situation. She was being approached by one of the one

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.140
 of my fellow duty officers. And hey was making advances on and, uh,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.000
 she expressed the ah, you know, her her feelings, that she didn't want

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.850
 the advances and that she didn't want him to get in trouble and

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.710
 that he hadn't touched or anything. He was just pushing up on her and

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.570
 I had done it a few times, and she wanted to bring it to someone's

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.430
 attention. But he didn't want you. She didn't want to get him in trouble.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.280
 So I told her I talked to him and I wanted her to keep me in

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.140
 the loop. If something were to happen because, you know, I would take

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.000
 it up the chain of command. So, um, I don't calling him on the ship

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.860
 phone one day and asked him to come talk to me and s o he proceeded

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.710
 to do so. And you know, I told him, you know what I had been told

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.570
 and that he shouldn't do, you know, you know, proceed any further, you

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.430
 know, to stop it here. And ah, he kind agreed to it and known associate.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.290
 Kind of agreed to it s o. I informed my immediate supervisor.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.140
 And, you know, we just kind of moved on from there. Well, he proceeded.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.000
 Thio continued advances and, you know, I ended up taking it up

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.860
 the chain of command and sometime later, but the time between I me

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.720
 initially knowing about it and between me take it up to command had

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.570
 been about two months, So I ended up getting in a little trouble behind

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.430
 it and looking back of I don't know if I would handle it any differently

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.290
 because I felt like I was doing the right thing by handled

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.150
 it the situation at the lowest level. Ah. Then on the other hand, I

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.000
 would say that it was a situation where I should have just taken it

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.860
 up the chain of command immediately, you know, So it's kind of like

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.720
 a battle with that, even today
