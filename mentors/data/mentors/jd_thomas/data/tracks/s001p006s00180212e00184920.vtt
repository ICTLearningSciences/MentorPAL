00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.740
all the major negatives to doing this kind of work would be stress you

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.620
 deal with a lot day in and day out and sometimes it it may feel as

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.510
 if as if it's too much to handle you don't sleep much you're always

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.390
 on the go so you kind of your mind is almost re taught and how it operates

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.280
 so you're you spent a lot of time like even rest in trying to

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:36.160
 slow your mind down and lie operate at a normal level so it's kind

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.050
 of tough to decompress at times when operating and working on over under

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.930
 a an environment like that
