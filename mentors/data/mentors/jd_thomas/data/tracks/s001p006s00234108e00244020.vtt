00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.780
I think one main misconception is that your that you operate with a sort

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.700
 of privilege and that you're like born into like this opportunity,

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.630
 that you're just different, that you're special. I think that's the

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.560
 big thing I liketo believe. And I really do feel this way that I'm

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.480
 just like you. I'm just like anyone else who I'm serving with. It's

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.410
 just I had a different opportunity. Someone told me about a program

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.340
 that this person didn't know about. Someone gave me opportunity tohave

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.260
 this chance to, you know, serve, serve our country that someone

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.190
 else didn't know about. So I think that's the big thing. Is that your

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.120
 sole special and that you're different? You're like you're cut from

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.040
 a different cloth or something like that. But how big a difference
