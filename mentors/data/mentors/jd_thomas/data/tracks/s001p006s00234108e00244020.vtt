I think one main misconception is that your that you operate with a sort

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.600
 of privilege and that you're like born into a life this opportunity

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.970
 that you just different it's your special I think that's the big

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.350
 thing I like to believe and I really do feel this way that I'm just

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.720
 like you are just like anyone else who server with this yes I had a

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.100
 different opportunity someone told me about a program that this person

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.470
 did know about someone gave me the opportunity to have this chance

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.850
 to you know service serve our country that someone else didn't know

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.220
 about so I think that's the big thing is that your your soul special

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.600
 and that you're different your like your cut from like a different

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.970
 cloth or something like that but how big a difference
