00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.300
um, how does someone recover to failure or bump in a row? It's It's simple,

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.750
 It's It's kind of like football. It's a lot like football running

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.200
 backs. They're always talked to keep your legs moving. If you get

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.650
 into a tough spot, cluster ball as tight as you can, which in this

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.100
 situation would be the goal that you're trying to obtain. Put your

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.550
 head down and just keep your legs moving. So I say that as an analogy

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.000
 to say, Hey, if you run into a bump in the road, always keep your

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.440
 golden mind. Embrace it and just keep working towards that. Go. Keep

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.890
 pushing. Keep pushing. Keep pushing that never give up. If you give

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.340
 up. That's when the answer becomes no, that's the moment that you give

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.790
 up on you. Drop the ball or you stop moving your legs. That's when

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.240
 the answer becomes no, and you feel so Just keep going. Keep moving.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.690
 It might. You might not go in the right direction, but go 100 miles

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.140
 an hour in one direction or somewhere. But just keep your legs moving

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.590
 and just embrace your goal. What you're trying to obtain and just

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.040
 keep
