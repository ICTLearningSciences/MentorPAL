00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.600
how does someone recover to a failure or bump in the road is is simple

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.340
 it's it's kind of like football well it's a lot like football on running

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.090
 backs they're always taught to keep your legs move if you get

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.830
 into a tough spot close the bottle as tight as you can which in this

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.580
 situation would be the goal that you're trying to obtain put your head

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.330
 down and just keep the leg moving so I say that as an analogy to

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.070
 say Hey if you run into a bump in the road always keep your goal in

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.820
 mind embrace it and just keep working towards that goal keep pushing

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.560
 keep pushing keep pushing that never give up if you give up that's

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.310
 when the answer becomes no that's the moment that you give up and you

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.060
 drop the ball or you stop move your legs that's when the answer becomes

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.800
 no and you fail so just keep going keep moving it might you might

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.550
 not going the right direction we're gonna miles an hour in one

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.290
 direction or somewhere but just keep your legs moving and just embrace

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.040
 your goal what you're trying to obtain just keep
