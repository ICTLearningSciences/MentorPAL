00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.990
um, simple words of advice for me, for someone to understand, to get to

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.130
 know their bosses would be to listen. Listen, in the observant again,

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.270
 you will be able to see the things they do. You hear the things

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.400
 that they talk about, and as time goes on, they will open up to you

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.540
 about the things that they like to do, the things that they like to

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.680
 talk about. And that would be your opportunity. Teoh, you know, find

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.820
 some common area that you guys share. I like fishing. So chances are

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.960
 if we walk by, we were walking and you were a subordinate of man and

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.100
 we're walking by. I say, I don't know efficient pollen or something.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.230
 You might hear me say something like, You know, I wish I had a ride

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.370
 or something. I could go fishing right now and that will be your

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.510
 opportunity. It's simple and subtle. Things like that. Uh, just listen

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.650
 and observe
