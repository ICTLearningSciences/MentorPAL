00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.650
good strategies would be to again empathize. I typically would make routine

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.440
 rounds with the team, so I would come in, you know, in the morning,

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.240
 right before lunch after lunch sometime in the evening and be

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.040
 present during special evolution's. If you know your your team has,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.830
 say, evolution to training evolution, you might want to be around for

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.630
 it. Be around for the meetings, be around. Just be there. Be be around.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.430
 It adds your input when it's needed. Sometimes you'll have to

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.220
 play. What I call would be the sword and the shield. Well, they might

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.020
 need someone to speak up for them to a senior, And you might be there

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.810
 might be that guy that take the sword and go out and do what you

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.610
 need to do and speak for them. But at the same time, if something happens,

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.410
 that's, um, like, not so good for your team as, say, a training

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.200
 evolution didn't go is playing. You need to be there to defend them,

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.000
 but how would you defend him if you're not there?
