00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.650
of good strategies would be to again empathize I'm typically would make

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.440
 routine rounds with the team so I would come in you know in the morning

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.240
 right before lunch after lunch sometime in the evening and be

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.040
 present during special evolutions if you know your your team has say

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.830
 evolution to a training evolution you might want to be around for the

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.630
 around for the meetings there around just be there be be around it

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.430
 add your input when it's needed sometimes you'll have to play what

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.220
 I call would be the sword and shield will they might need someone to

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.020
 speak up for them to a senior and you might be there might be that

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.810
 guy to take the sword and go out and do what you need to do and speak

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.610
 for them but at the same time if something happens that like not

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.410
 so good for your your your team as say a a training evolution didn't

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.200
 go as planned you need to be there to defend them but how would you

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.000
 defend them if you're not there
