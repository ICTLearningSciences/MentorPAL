00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.950
the failures that I think that makes me the most unhappy would probably

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.060
 be personal failures, as in failed relationships with friends. Failed

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:16.160
 relationships with, you know, say girlfriends and even professionally,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.270
 were things that I feel as a person that I could have done better

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.370
 at managing those situations, you know, being more positive, being

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.480
 more helpful, being less selfish and more selfless. Those are the

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.580
 things that I think about, day in and day out, and but on a positive

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.690
 note, they helped me to build better relationships going forward.
