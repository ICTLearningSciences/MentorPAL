00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.680
strategies to help Listen, Will would be to first acknowledge that you

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.520
 have a problem listening with to, um, take note of it while you're

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.350
 listening to someone's talk or attempting to listen to one to someone.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.180
 Speak, Be mindful of how much you interrupt of how much you speak

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.010
 or you attempt to speak. I always say that people there are two types

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.850
 of people, people who listen to respond and people who listen to

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.680
 understand. If you know that you're a person that listens to respond,

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.510
 practice not responding practice, listening, engaging, active listening.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.340
 Which would be say, if you're speaking to me, maybe not, maybe

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.180
 respond. Ask a question while they're speaking, and as time goes on,

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.010
 you'll just develop those habits of not speaking while someone else

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.840
 is. You know why you're supposed to be listening? Try to repeat things

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.670
 in your mind that that person is saying, and those things are

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.510
 definitely get you started on the right path of being a being a better

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.340
 listener
