00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.010
Wow, that's a tough one. Um, my favorite. That's on to two sides. I would

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:11.160
 say My favorite place to live or favorite places to live would probably

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.320
 be yakuza in Japan and Jacksonville, Florida. I say you cools

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.470
 go because it was a total culture shot and it was just an awesome

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.630
 place to live. You know, you see the different cultures. You see how

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.790
 their customs, how the traditions that they live by just the ease off

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.940
 being a foreigner and living in a different country was just an amazing

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.100
 experience. Also living in Jacksonville, you know, I'm a born

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.260
 and raised Georgia boy, so being a Jacksonville is like being in South

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.410
 Georgia. So I'm the biggest Georgia Bulldog fan there is. So, of

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.570
 course, got to go to the Georgia Florida games. The cocktail party,

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.720
 Um, and it was just awesome being around family and friends while also

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.880
 being able to go to work and, you know, serve the country
