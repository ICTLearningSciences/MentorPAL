00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.130
on increase in operational tempo is it's a tough one. For my first ever

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.410
 tour, I was on the USS lasting out in yakuza. Good opinion. And the

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.690
 operational tempo there was, like, something that I've never experienced

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.980
 before. It was definitely monster. Uh, s O. I would handle operations

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.260
 tempo just simply by, you know, adapting my lifestyle around

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.540
 what needed to be done at work and but also finding some work life

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.820
 balance. I'm kind of a home body, so I would get off work late in the

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.100
 evening. And, of course, you know, the things that I enjoy watching

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.380
 on TV, we're coming out early in the morning, which were like football.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.660
 So I would still make sure I got in, say, two or three hours

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.940
 to watch some sports center to sit at home and cook some chicken wings

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.230
 and, you know, being my happy place and just sit and watch TV for

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.510
 a couple hours. But that that little bit of time, you know, will allow

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.790
 you to I kind of feel your gas tank back up and get ready for the

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.070
 next
