00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.020
 I was on the USS lesson out and you cause cause pain and the operational

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.610
 tempo there was like something that I've never experienced

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.200
 before it was definitely a monster so I would handle operations to the

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.790

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.370
 to be done at work and I'm a but also finding some work life balance

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.960

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.130

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.480
 hours but that that little bit of time you know will allow you to kind

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.070
