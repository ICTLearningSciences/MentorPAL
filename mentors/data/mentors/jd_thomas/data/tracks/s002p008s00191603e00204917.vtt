00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.020
so when it comes to of services in and around the base for I'm I don't

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.200
 know maybe barber shops laundry services there's always something available

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.370
 every command or every of naval station has like a mix of many

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.550
 necks and that typically has a number of restaurants a barber shop

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.720
 a dry cleaners for uniforms a grocery store commissaires somewhere

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.900
 for you to go shopping and just think about it you're not the first

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.070
 person to obtain a commission and you know the station and into the

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.250
 station so the community typically responds to the military where

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.420
 they're soft and along the lines of a army base and naval station even

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.590
 like a school house or something like that so outside of bass and

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.770
 around base you can basically find all the things that you you need

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.940
 to you know to me to bait the basic human needs are you barber shops

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.120
 or grocery stores your barn grills on your restaurant so there's always

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.290
 somewhere you know for you to find what you need you just have

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.470
 to be willing to step outside of bass and ride around ask questions

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.640
 you know talk to people and typically your shipmates senior sailors

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.820
 who already had a process down you just got to ask him to know where

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.990
 to go and who to go see to get what you pay
