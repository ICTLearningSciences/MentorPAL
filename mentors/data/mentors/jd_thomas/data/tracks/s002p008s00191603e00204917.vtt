00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.750
So when it comes to, ah, service is in and around the base for, I don't

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.650
 know, maybe barbershops. Laundry service is there's always something

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.560
 available. Every command or every naval station has, like a next

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.460
 of mini nicks and that typically has a number of restaurants, a barbershop,

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.360
 dry cleaners for uniforms. Ah, a grocery store Comets area somewhere

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.260
 for you to go shopping. Just think about it. You're not the

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.160
 first person to obtain a commission and be stationed in a new duty

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.070
 station. So the community typically responds to the military when they're

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.970
 something along the lines off a army base, a naval station, even

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.870
 like a schoolhouse or something like that. So outside of bass and

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.770
 around base, you can basically find all the things that you you need

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.680
 thio, you know, to meet you bait the basic human needs, your barber

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.580
 shops, grocery stores. Um, um, your bar and grill's your restaurants

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.480
 on. There's always somewhere you know, for you to find what you need.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.380
 You just have to be willing to step outside of bass and right around

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.280
 ask questions. You know, talk to people and typically your, uh,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.190
 shipmates in your sailors already have the process down. You just

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.090
 got to ask him to know where to go and who to go see to get what you

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.990
 need.
