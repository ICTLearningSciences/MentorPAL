00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.990
strategies to help listen will would be to first acknowledge that you

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.130
 have a problem listening with to take note of why you're listening to

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.270
 someone talk more tempting to listen to want to someone speak of be

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.410
 mindful of how much you interrupt of how much you speak for your turn

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.550
 to speak always say that people there are two types of people people

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.690
 who listen to respond and people who listen to understand if you

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.830

 be say if you're speaking to me maybe not maybe respond ask a question

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.260
 wow they're speaking and as time goes all users develop those

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.400
 habits of not speaking while someone else's you know why you're supposed

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.540
 to be listening try to repeat things in your mind that that person

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.680
 is saying and those things are it would definitely get you started
