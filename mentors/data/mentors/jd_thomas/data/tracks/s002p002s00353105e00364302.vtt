00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.650
strategies to help Listen Will would be to first acknowledge that you

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.450
 have a problem listening with two. Take note of it while you're listening

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.240
 to someone's talk or attempting to listen to one to someone speak,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.040
 Be mindful of how much you interrupt of how much you speak or you

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.840
 attempt to speak. I always say that people there are two types of

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.640
 people. People who listen to respond and people who listen to understand.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.440
 If you know that you're a person that listens to respond, practice

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.230
 not responding. Practice. Listening, engaging, active listening.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.030
 Which would be say, if you're speaking to me, maybe not, maybe respond.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.830
 Ask a question while they're speaking, and as time goes on, you'll

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.630
 just develop those habits of not speaking while someone else's.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.430
 You know why you're supposed to be listening? Try to repeat things

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.220
 in your mind that that person is saying, and those things are definitely

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.020
 get you started on the right path of being a been a better listener
