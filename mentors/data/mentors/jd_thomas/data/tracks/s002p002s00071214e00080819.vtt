00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.950
as far as relationship with a subordinate. I had, ah, Chief Petty officer.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.040
 Once he told me that if you always keep it professional, you'll

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.140
 never have to worry about anything. So I would take that notion if

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:21.230
 you and I would add onto it. Stay professional, stay respectful, stay

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.330
 cordial and add Yummy. Include something in your personality. Never

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.420
 always be genuine is what I'm trying to say, So genuineness. Be cordial.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.520
 Be respectful, be professional and be respected and just stay

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.610
 true to yourself and things will flow how they're supposed to flow

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.710
 now. Giving you won't get along and be buddy buddy with everyone. But

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.800
 you keep those things in mind and you'll always have a positive and

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.900
 productive working environment with those subordinates.
