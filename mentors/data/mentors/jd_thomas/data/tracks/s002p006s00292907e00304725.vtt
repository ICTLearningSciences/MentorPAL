00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.450
um, it's kind of kind of goes back to the whole analogy of kind of like

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.050
 the closest allocated to the boat again. Uh, you definitely empathize

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.650
 with your family and you understand who you are to them and what

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.250
 you mean to them and your responsibilities and how you want. Thio.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.840
 Proceed going forward with your family, but at the same time you have,

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.440
 you know, career obligations. So that's probably like the biggest

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.040
 balancing job that you'll ever do as a person. You know, it's difficult,

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.640
 and it's not easy. One thing I will definitely say, if you don't

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.240
 if you don't remember anything, I see it. Just remember that you're

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.840
 the neighbor will always be there after you're going long after you're

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.440
 going, neighbor, be here. But when you decide to retire, who will

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.040
 be there to support you when you get out of the Navy? That's something

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.630
 for you, too. Definitely think about. You don't want to be standing

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.230
 there by yourself or giving your flag to give me your your certificates

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.830
 and your flags, too, like your mom or something like that,

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.430
 you know, so keep that in mind when your balance in home life and

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.030
 work
