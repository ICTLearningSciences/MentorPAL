00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.340
to make a change in the team were basically discussed and changing the

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.830
 culture s. So how do you change that culture? I would first say would

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.320
 be leading by example. The second thing would be be in prison So

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.810
 you can't change the culture by my not being there. So you have to be

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.300
 around the sailors. You have to be around the personnel. You have

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.790
 to be there when they're going through rough times. You have to be there

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.280
 during the best times. Change that culture. They're gonna look

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.760
 at you as an example of what to do and what not to do in situations.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.250
 Uhm as time goes on and as you progress in your your tours you'll start

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.740
 to notice that sailors will watch every everything that you do

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.230
 and what you say. And eventually they'll come to you and ask you for

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.720
 advice, sir. How do I do this? Sir, if you were in this situation,

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.210
 what would you do? And that's how you change culture. It takes time,

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.700
 but you leave by example and you stay present You You will eventually

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.190
 move that culture on being a more positive and productive environment.
