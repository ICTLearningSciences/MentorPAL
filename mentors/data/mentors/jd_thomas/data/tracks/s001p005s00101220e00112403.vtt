00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.340
how to make a change in the team we're basically discussed and changing

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.830
 the culture so how do you change the culture our first say would be

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.320
 lead by example on the second thing would be being present so you

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.810
 can't change a culture about my by not being there so you have to be

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.300
 around the sailors you have to be around the person they are you have

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.790
 to be there when they're going through rough times you have to be

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.280
 there during the best time of the change that culture they're going

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.760
 to look at you as an example of what to do and what not to do in situations

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.250
 as time goes on and as as you progress in your your tours you

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.740
 start to notice that sailors will watch every everything that you

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.230
 do and what you say and eventually they'll come to you and ask you

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.720
 for advice Sir how do I do this Sir if you were in this situation what

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.210
 would you do and that's how you change culture it takes time but

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.700
 you lead by example and you stay present and you you'll eventually move

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.190
 that culture on being a more positive and productive environment

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.680
