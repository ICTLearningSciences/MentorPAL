00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.110
all right so two things here worry is the wrong word you should never

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.380
 worry about retirement of two you should always think about retirement

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.640
 so as soon as you basically as soon as you you raise your right hand

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.910
 you should be focused on retirement you should live your career

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.170
 to retire so the idea for me is to retire excuse me is to retire as

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.430
 an old six at twenty five years that would give me the I will put me

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.700
 at a certain income range in a certain pension range also the navy

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.960
 has done a awesome job of helping sailors plan for retirement through

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.230
 the first savings plan the T. S. P. so out of your first four years

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.490
 say within the military or typical and listen for a list of servicemen

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.750
 you'll be all like a probationary pier where your basically you

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.020
 you're given I think five percent after that first year of being in

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:09.280
 the military the neighbor mass five percent to your five percent and

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.550
 you can put anywhere up to nothing each year or your entire paycheck

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.810
 or your special pays all your bonuses into his tea is pretty a good

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.080
 rule of thumb for invested into your retirement is ten percent so

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.340
 I would recommend you put in about ten percent into your retirement

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.600
 through the T. S. B. monthly and for for the start of your career as

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.870
 you gain incoming game rank and obtain bonuses I would say you you

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.130
 know find that financial freedom to balance that your spending habits

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.400
 and what about pet but paying yourself first through investments

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.660
 in your TSB so you should never worry about retirement but should always

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.920
 have on your mind so investing your retirement by using utilizing

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.190

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.720
