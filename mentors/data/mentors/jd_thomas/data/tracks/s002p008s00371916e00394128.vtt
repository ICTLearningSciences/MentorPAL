00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.320
All right, so two things here worry is the wrong word. You should never

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.780
 worry about retirement too. You should always think about retirement.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.250
 So as soon as you, uh, basically, as soon as you raise your right

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.720
 hand, you should be focused on retirement. You should live your career

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.180
 to retire. So the idea for me is to retire. Excuse me is to retire

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.650
 as an 06 at 25 years. That would give me that would put me out of

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:39.120
 certain income range and a certain pension range. Also, the Navy has

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.580
 done an awesome job of helping sailors plan for retirement through

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.050
 the first savings playing the TSP. So out of your 1st 4 years, say,

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.520
 within the military or a typical enlistment for Ah, listen, serviceman,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.980
 you'll be on like a probationary pier where you're, uh, basically,

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.450
 you're given, I think, 5%. After that first year of being in the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.920
 military, the neighborhood match 5% to your 5% and you can put anywhere

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.380
 up to nothing each year or your entire paycheck or your special

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.850
 pays or your bonuses into this TSP A good rule of thumb for investing

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.310
 into your retirement is 10%. So I would recommend you put in about

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.780
 10% into your retirement through the TSP monthly and for the start

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.250
 of your career, a CZ you gain income and gain rank and obtained bonuses.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.710
 I would say, you know, find that financial freedom to balance

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.180
 that you're spending habits and but paying by paint. But paying yourself

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.650
 first through your investments in your TSP. So you should never

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.110
 worry about retirement but should always have it on your mind. So

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.580
 invested in your retirement by using utilizing the TSP and other investments.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.050
 Such a mutual funds. Rafael Reyes Traditional IRAs, um, certificates

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.510
 of deposits, things that of that nature. So never worry about

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.980
 retirement, but think about it always.
