00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.670
early as possible home as soon as you are up for a slate or use I would

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.480
 say as soon as you get to your first duty station so as soon as you

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.300
 get there you should always be thinking about what you want to go

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.120
 there we want to do next what what bought what bill it's what options

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.940
 that that may be available for you to do next and how it relates to

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.750
 and how it revolves around what you want to accomplish with your family

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.570
 give you an example for example myself I like to be married in

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.390
 a couple years I'm pursuing a department head and one day be a CEO

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.210
 I would like to go back to Jacksonville that's where I have a rental

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.020
 property my family's from Georgia in say everything goes as planned

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.840
 and I get married have kids I would like my key is to know my parents

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.660
 but in the event that I'm shipped off to say San Diego or nor full

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.480
 or Hawaii or Japan or Spain at just makes it the situation a little

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.290
 bit more you know difficult to deal with so coming up with secondary

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.110
 and tertiary options early and often you know I can better prepare

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.930
 myself and my family and my situation going for
