00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.670
early as possible, a soon as you are up for Ah, Slate or you, I would

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.480
 say as soon as you get your first duty station. So as soon as you get

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.300
 there, you should always be thinking about what you want to go next.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.120
 What do you want to do next? What, What what billets, what options

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.940
 that may be available for you to do next and how it relates to and

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.750
 how it revolves around what you want to accomplish with your family.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.570
 I'll give you an example, for example, myself, I'd like to be married

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.390
 in a couple of years. I'm pursuing department hit and one day be

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.210
 a CEO. I would like to go back to Jacksonville. That's where I have

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.020
 a rental property. My family's from Georgia, uh, and say Everything

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.840
 goes, is playing and I get married, have kids. I would like my kids,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.660
 my parents, but in event that I'm shipped off to say, San Diego or

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.480
 Nor ful, or Hawaii or Japan or Spain, that just makes the situation

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.290
 a little bit more difficult to deal with. So coming up with secondary

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.110
 and tertiary options early and often, you know I can better prepare

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.930
 myself and my family and my situation going forward
