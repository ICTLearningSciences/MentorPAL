00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.590
um, I didn't find the strength of Regency. It's kind of a simple, and

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.330
 it goes back to two more words. I keep saying, Listen and observe. By

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.070
 being present and being around your team, you'll notice who's more

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.800
 vocal. You'll notice who will stand out as being You know, the goal

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.540
 getter, the hard worker. You'll notice who will be more of the quiet

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.280
 one that doesn't do too much or doesn't say much, even when during,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.020
 like, started training evolutions or even like operating. You know

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.760
 who's the first to step up, who won't step up and by being around and

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.500
 watching how that occurs, you'll learn where one sailor has one strength

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.240
 and another one has a weakness, and you can kind of paired together

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.980
 and turn in that aspect. Eso As time goes on, the more you watching,

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.710
 the more you around your sailors and your team, you'll see

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.450
 who has certain strengths and who has certain weaknesses and that all

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.190
 that kind of allowed you to manage. You know who to put with who and

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.930
 how the better, you know, go for how to move on from there
