00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.560
um the differences between us and the other branches are for one. I think

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.260
 our culture, um, a big day for me, especially when I joined, was

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.970
 the fact that if you join the Navy nine times out of 10 you will be

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.670
 around some form of water and, uh, unlike being an air force of the

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.380
 Army or the Marines. I didn't want to be anywhere near the desert or

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.090
 anywhere near, like a bunch of just like nature. I didn't want to

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.790
 sleep after sleep out in the field. I rather sleep in a little cotton

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.500
 on the ship at the bottom of the ship, as opposed to sleeping out

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.210
 in the desert. So I would say those are like, two of the big things

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.910
 is just the the locations that you're operating here and the climates

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.620
 and environments operating in and just the culture of being a sailor.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.320
 Um, being on the inside, you can kind of notice like a definitely

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.030
 a rah rah. You know, uh, mentality out of the say, the Marines and

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.740
 the Army and the Air Force is more like laid back, like we're kind

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.440
 of casual on the neighbors, just kind of like in the middle, you know,
