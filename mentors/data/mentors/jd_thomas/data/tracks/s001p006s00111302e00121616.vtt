so as far as decisions you're you're making split decisions like every

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.870
 two or three minutes there's always something with the division that

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.380
 I had which was like I said about twenty six or twenty seven people

 and I email this person that I call this person that I talk to this

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.480
 person have I done this have I done that so there's a split decision

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.990
 is made like every I don't know thirty seconds or so who
