so far his decisions. You're you're making split decisions like every

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.870
 two or three minutes. There's always something with the division that

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.380
 I, which was like I said about 26 27 people. Everyone has a personality.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.890
 Everyone has an issue. Everyone has something going on and not

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.400
 to include the ship's schedule. Where there's training, where there's

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.910
 evolutions, where there's always something happening, and then not

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.420

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.930
 and your qualifications in. So that doesn't include communicating

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.440
 with your boss's your supervisors, which are, You know, your second

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.950
 tour is your department is maybe even XO. So you're making decisions

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.460
 on where to go next. Who to talk to next? What to do next? Did I

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.970
 email this person that I call this person that I talked to this person?

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.480
 Have I done this? Have I done that? So they're split decisions

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.990
 made like every don't know, 30 seconds or so
