00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.310
This one is a very tough one. And the first thing is I'll say is you.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.780
 You be empathetic and in terms off a family emergency, you express your

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.240
 sympathy. Uh, so you my experience, I would discuss this privately

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.700
 and personally with this sailor and ah, number of support personnel

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.160
 that are available whether that be a chapel in the dark that's onboard

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.630
 the Corbin. It's on board and with the maybe the eggs or the CEO

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.090
 if they're available. But just realize and understand the situation

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.550
 like this, you do not have to go about this alone. You want there

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.010
 by yourself to do or conduct a this type of thing by yourself in terms

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.480
 off almost impossible assignment That depends on your team in your

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.940
 relationship with that team and how you, uh, have conducted like

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.400
 prior situations, too. So getting with your so you're leading chief

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.860
 petty officer or your your chief petty officer leaving lpo and just

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.330
 sitting down with your team members and discussing what's what's about

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.790
 to take place
