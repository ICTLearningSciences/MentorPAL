00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.680
So is a active duty service member. You still pay income taxes and, um,

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.500
 you pay state taxes depending on what home? A residency that you claim

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.330
 on your Texas. So states like Florida, Texas they don't have state

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.150
 takes state taxes, but you have sales taxes. So say, for example,

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.980
 of Georgia. Georgia has a state income tax of 6%. So because I'm a

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.810
 residency of Florida, don't have to pay state income. Tax is a SW far

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.630
 is, um, pays and bonuses. You do pay taxes on your bonuses, and you

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.460
 pay taxes on your basic income or your income every month. If you

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.280
 are operating in a tax free zone, say, overseas or in a combat zone,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.110
 you don't pay taxes on any of your your ah allotments. With that being

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.930
 said, a lot of people they'll go and they'll enlist in tax free

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.760
 zones, and that way they get their full bonus. Uh, this is little two

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.590
 bit a SZ faras deductions. You are not allowed to deduct things like

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.410
 haircuts. Um, from what I understand, uniforms mileage on transportation.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:28.240
 You can't deduct that those kinds of things, but you can like

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.060
 I say, you're allowed to avoid state taxes by whatever residency

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.890
 you claim measure state
