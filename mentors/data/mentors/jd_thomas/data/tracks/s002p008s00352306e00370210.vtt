00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.040
so is they are active duty service member you still pay income taxes and

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.230
 you pay state taxes depending on what a home residency that you claim

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.420
 on your taxes so states like Florida Texas they don't have state

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.610
 takes state taxes but if you have sales taxes so say for example Georgia

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.800
 Georgia has a state income tax of six percent so because I'm

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.990
 a residency of Florida don't have to pay state income taxes as far as

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:44.180
 pays the bonuses you do pay taxes on your bonuses and you pay taxes

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.370
 on your basic income or your your income every month if you are operating

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.560
 in a tax free zone say overseas or in a combat zone you don't

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.750
 pay taxes on any of your your allotments with that being said a lot

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.940
 of people they'll go and you know a list in tax free zones and that

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.130
 way they get their full bonus this is a little two bit as far as deductions

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.320
 you are not allowed to deduct things like hair cuts from what

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.510
 I understand uniforms mileage on transportation you you can't deduct

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:33.700
 that those kinds of things but you can like I say you're allowed

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.890
 to avoid state taxes by whatever residency you claim as a state
