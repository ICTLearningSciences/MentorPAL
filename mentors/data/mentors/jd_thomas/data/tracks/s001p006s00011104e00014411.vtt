00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.570
most of my time at work was spent basically mentor or doing paperwork

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.300
 again. I kind of go by the notion toe lead by example on the way to

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.020
 impact a culture would be too have people seeing you doing with your

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.750
 request of them. And if they see you working, they're more inclined

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.470
 to work. They say you're doing the right thing. They're more inclined

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.200
 to do the right thing. So that's how I spent most of my time at work.
