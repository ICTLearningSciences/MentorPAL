00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.360
most of my time at work was spent basically mentor or doing paperwork

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.870
 again I kind of go by the the notion to lead by example and the way

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.380
 to impact a culture would be to staff people seeing you doing what you

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.900
 request of them and if they see you working there more inclined to

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.410
 work they see you doing the right thing they're more inclined to do

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.920
 the right thing so that's how I spent most of my time at work
