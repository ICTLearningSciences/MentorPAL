00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.000
my response will be a question that you Are you married? Do you have a

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.150
 girlfriend? Do you have kids? If you have any one of the three, your

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.300
 chances of going to debt are very high. You know, I'm just playing,

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.450
 but, um, I think the key here is to understand what a budget is and

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.600
 how to live within your budget. Um, as a junior officer, you get paid

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.750
 a You get paid a decent amount. Um, but the key is to understand

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.900
 how your life is affected by how much you make a short money lesson

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.050
 is, you know, revenue minus expenses. That's kind of how you kind of

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.200
 you need to kind of frame what you're going by. If you're buildout,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.350
 we how much you, mate, you're gonna go into debt. So the idea is to

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.500
 find living arrangements. Fine. Do the obtained the basic necessities

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.650
 to sustain life, which are, you know, shelter, food and clothing

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.800
 and just kind of branch out from there. Do you really need to go out

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.950
 and buy the newest, hottest Mercedes Benz? You probably don't if you

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.100
 have a, you know, functional for transportation For the time being,

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.250
 why go buy a new car. Um, if you do, you have to eat out 56 times

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.400
 a week. Probably not go grocery shopping. Learn how to cook. So learn

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.550
 how to balance that budget and stay and live within your means, and

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.700
 you won't worry about debt.
