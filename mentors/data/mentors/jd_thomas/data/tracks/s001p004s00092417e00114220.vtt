00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.600
for me flight school of it will it it could be looked at as a touchy situation

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.350
 but for me it's a learning experience fly student work out

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:18.100
 for me for a multitude of reasons I'm a very spiritual person so when

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.860
 you when you attend a a strenuous training environment such as flight

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.610
 school you have to be one hundred and ten percent focused on achieving

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.360
 that goal I wasn't able to do that so down there was focused

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.110
 on a multitude of different things that fight flight school kind of

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.860
 took a backseat and by the time that it did take a bit of a front row

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.610
 seat it was too late I was on able to recover and fortunately I was

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.360
 able to regroup and move on to something else I think as in general

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.110
 as servicemen you know sailors and you know military all I guess you

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.870
 could say we all have this this inner thoughts about this inner thought

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.620
 or this interview of ourselves as if we can accomplish any and

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.370
 everything but the in reality you know we fail sometimes sometimes

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:27.120
 things just don't work out and you have to develop that that outlook

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.870
 that sometimes things just don't go your way and sometimes you fail

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.620
 but the key here is when you fail can you move on with a better outlook

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.370
 on what happened you always have to look at a situation as a learning

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:50.120
 experience as some some look at something some in some way shape

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.880
 or form as how do I improve off of this situation and that's what

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.630
 I had to do and that's what you'll be asked to do when whatever situation

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.380
 you're and doesn't go as planned it's temporary and that you

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.130
 can move on and be you know be a better person that whatever it may

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.880
 be you just hit a bump in the road you can move for
