00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.370
for me Flight school, it it could be looked at as a touch of situation.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.890
 But for me, it's, Ah, a learning experience. Flight school didn't

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:17.410
 work out for me. For a multitude of reasons. I'm a very spiritual person.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.930
 So when you when you attend a strenuous training environment such

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.460
 as flight school, you have to be 110% focused on achieving that

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.980
 goal. Um, I wasn't able to do that. So down there I was focused on a

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.500
 multitude of different things. That flight school kind of took a back

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.020
 seat. And by the time that it did take a front row seat, it was too

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.540
 late. I was unable to, uh, recover, and fortunately, I was able to

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.060
 regroup and move on to something else. Um, I think as in general as

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.580
 servicemen, you know, sailors and military, uh, people. I guess you

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:07.100
 could say we all have this this inner thoughts about this inner thought

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.630
 or this interview of ourselves as if we can accomplish any and

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.150
 everything but the reality, you know, we fail. Sometimes, Sometimes

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.670
 things just don't work out, and you have to develop that that outlook

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.190
 that sometimes things just don't go your way, and sometimes you fail.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.710
 But the key here is when you fail, can you move on with a better

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.230
 outlook on what happened? You always have to look at a situation as

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.750
 a learning experience as some some look at something some in some

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.270
 way, shape or form as how do I improve off of this situation? And that's

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.800
 what I had to do. And that's what you'll be asked to do when whatever

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.320
 situation you're in doesn't go as planned, it's temporary and

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.840
 that you can move on and be, you know, be a better person at whatever

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.360
 it may be. You just hit a bump in the road and you can move forward.
