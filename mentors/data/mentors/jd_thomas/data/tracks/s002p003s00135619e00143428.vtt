00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.290
This one is, in a sense, a tough one, but it's in a sense, it's not. I

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.730
 could easily sit here and say There's no no reason to ever break the

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.170
 roof. But in certain situations there, maybe What if you're asked

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.620
 to fire on some unarmed civilians or some, you know, women and Children,

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:28.060
 unarmed women and Children? Would you break the rules, Huh? Of

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.500
 disobeying a direct order to not kill women and Children or Woods, So

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.940
 on it see on the service is easy to say. It's never too late.
