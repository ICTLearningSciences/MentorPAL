00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.850
Um, I don't think there's anything different. I've always approached being

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.850
 a leader by being humbled by being almost like being being a follower

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.840
 first. If you can follow, you can lead. So if you leave with

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.840
 empathy, you understand how how it fields or what it's like to follow

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.840
 someone, then there's really no difference.
