00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.400
in terms of dealing with family, I'll say the leadership that empathizes

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.950
 the most and who also have families are probably They have probably

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.500
 the best habits because we, you know, to me, in my opinion, if you

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.050
 have a married CEO, the CEO has a CEO, if you know what I mean. You

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.600
 know? So he or she has to get home and, you know, balance that they

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.140
 have to balance that work, life, work, home life, um, balance. Just

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.690
 like you do. So if the demands aren't too high up on the ship, say,

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.240
 for example, an inside of inspection or, ah, light off inspection

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.790
 or something like that where it's not too demanding, too crazy, you

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.340
 know, coming up then typically, Thea Ciro will allow more time for the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.890
 sailors to spend with their families.
