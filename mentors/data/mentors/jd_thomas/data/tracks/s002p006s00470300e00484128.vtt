00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.020
military vacation is heavily dependent on your duty station, and you do

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.200
 the status. Typically a seagoing vessel. Say I give you a DDG, for

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.370
 example. They're too normal. Two big stand down periods, and that's

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.540
 one during the summer and one during, say, Christmas New Year's. You

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.710
 typically be allowed thio. Take extensive vacations. You know anywhere

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.890
 from no leave at all. If you don't want to O r thio say about two

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.060
 weeks, and you can you know ahead of time whether you will be allowed

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.230
 to take leave depending on the ship's schedule, of course, and

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.400
 you can take about two weeks and typically leave is approved, you know

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.580
 well, ahead of time out say anywhere from to four weeks or 2 to 6

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.750
 weeks ahead of time, given when the requirements or sit and, uh, you'll

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.920
 be allowed to go aware of or whenever do whatever you need to use

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.090
 long as you meet the training requirements and you express your you're

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.270
 want to go on vacation in a certain area ahead of time. It's all

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.440
 about planning, to be honest, but if you're in a say a student status

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.610
 like I am here MPs, um that's a little different. We typically

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.780
 get to take leave periods during long breaks or in extreme circumstances,

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.960
 you know, whenever we don't have class, so we're even during class

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.130
 if it's an emergency.
