 one during the summer and one during say Christmas new year's and

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.710
 I you'll typically be allowed to take extensive vacations you know

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.890
 anywhere from no leave at all if you don't want to or up to say about

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.060
 two weeks and you can you'll know ahead of time whether you you'll

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.230
 be allowed to take leave dependent on the ship schedule of course

 of time it's all about planning to be honest but if you're in a

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.610
 say a student status like I am here in PS that's a little different

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.780
