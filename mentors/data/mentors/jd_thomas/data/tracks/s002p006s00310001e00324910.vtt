00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.590
If you do an event that you're given an opportunity to live overseas,

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.340
 I would say, uh, short answer everything. Get everything. Really? Um,

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.080
 I'm not sure what you what that encompasses for you. For me, it was

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.820
 a total total life changer. Ah, lot of people don't bring their cars

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.570
 over there, so you need to have to decide to sell your car or, you

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.310
 know, leave it with someone so that they could maintain it. Some people

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.050
 have properties. Eso You have to decide whether to sell that property

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.790
 or put it up for rent, which means you have to find a property

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.540
 manager or find someone to help take care of it. Your phone changes

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.280
 because you're on totally different networks than you are from being

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.020
 over here in the U. S. As opposed to being in Spain or Japan. Everything

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.770
 everything is gonna change. Um, but that's something that,

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.510
 you know, You sit down with your command leadership and you dig into

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.250
 these things and say, Hey, you know, try to answer the questions before

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.000
 the ass, even family wise, what are the living options for a spouse,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.740
 for your spouse and for your Children in Japan or in your cool

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.480
 school, you know, at least sailors with dependence that were required

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.220
 to live on on base. So, you know, a lot of people, you know had their

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.970
 Children in school and their families lived in on base with him.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.710
 So those are things that you have to ask yourself. Ask the question

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.450
 before four gets asked, and sometimes, unfortunately, things fall

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.200
 between the cracks because no one thought about it. But it's up to you

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.940
 as the service member to do that.
