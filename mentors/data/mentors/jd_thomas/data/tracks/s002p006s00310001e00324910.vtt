00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.590
our view there are an event that you're given an opportunity to live overseas

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.340
 I would say short answer everything get everything ready I'm

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.080
 not sure what you'll what that encompasses for you for me it was a

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.820
 total total life changer a lot of people don't bring their cars over

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.570
 there so you need to have to decide to sell your car or you know leave

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.310
 it was someone so that they can maintain it some people have properties

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.050
 so you have to decide whether to sell that property or put it

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.790
 up for rent which means you have to find a property manager or find

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.540
 someone to help take care of it your phone changes because your own

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.280
 totally different networks than you are they did from being over here

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.020
 in the US as opposed to being in Spain or Japan everything everything's

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.770
 going to change but that's something that you know you sit down

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.510
 with your command leadership and you you you dig into these things

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.250
 and say Hey you know try to answer the questions before their ****

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.000
 even family wise what were the living options for a spouse for your

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.740
 spouse and for your children into paying or your cruise girl you know

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.480
 at least mmhm sailors with dependence that were required to live

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.220
 on on base so you know a lot of people you know had their children

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.970
 in school and their families lived in on base with so those are things

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.710
 that you have to ask the yourself ask a question before forget says

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.450
 and sometimes unfortunately things fall between the cracks because

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.200
 no one thought about it but it's up to you as the service member to

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.940
 do that
