00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.680
so as a also in the United States Navy you can be expected to move every

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.520
 two to three years I've been in the navy about nine years call ten

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.350
 years now and I'll probably move every one and a half to about two

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.190
 years of course some of my circumstances are a little different but

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.020
 I moved about every two years and you can a somewhat of a expect the

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.860
 same on your first to devote tours are about two years each and unless

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.690
 you fleet up your probably spend your first tour in one place and

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.530
 your second to another place after your second tour you'll go to

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.360
 shore duty chances are you'll want to spend that somewhere else or you'll

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.200
 go to our and say a master's degree or something so that means

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.030
 you move again after you finish your duty you can be expected to go

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.870
 to the park his school which you can bet you're gonna move from that

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.700
 to the station to o'reilly and then you move again to your department

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.540
 head of a duty stations was sure you have to do to so you moved

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.370
 to more time so by the time you reach say ten or twelve years or your

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.210
 second shore duty you moved about about four five times what is so

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.040
 you can expect to move right every two to three
