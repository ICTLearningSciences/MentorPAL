00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.680
So, um, as a officer in the United States Navy, you could be expected

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.520
 to move every 2 to 3 years. I've been in the Navy about nine years going

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.350
 on 10 years now, and I've probably moved every one and 1/2 to about

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.190
 two years. Of course, some of my circumstances are a little different,

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.020
 but I've moved about every two years, and you can somewhat of

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.860
 expect the same. Your first to devote tours are about two years each.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.690
 And unless you fleet up, you have probably spend your first tour

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.530
 in one place, and you're second to another place. After your second

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.360
 tour, you'll go to shore duty chases. Are you want to spend that somewhere

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.200
 else, Or you will go to earn, say, ah, master's degree or something.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.030
 So that means you move again after you finish your duty. You

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.870
 could be expected to go to department here school, which you can bet

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.700
 you're gonna move from that duty station to Rhode Island and then

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.540
 you move again to your department head duty stations, which you have

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.370
 to do to so you two more times. So by the time you reach, say, 10

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.210
 or 12 years or your second shore duty. You've moved about my 45 times

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.040
 right in, so you can expect to move about every 2 to 3.
