00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.840
owl in grade school I would probably say the was more studious I was always

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.840
 into the books I love reading a lot of writing love math and science

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.830
 I just enjoyed learning as I got older the more I got into sports

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.820
 and the more I got into girls the less focused on school of school

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.820
 came come easy to me in high school of so I can't remember too often

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.810
 like taking home a book because it came so naturally to me you

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.800
 know I think my parents and helped me develop that foundation of you

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.800
 know like being a quick learner and high school I didn't have to study

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.790
 so much college was kind of the same kind of fell you know fell

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.780
 in heart with the women and sports and less on studies so I really didn't

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.780
 focus my year college until my senior year which I was challenged

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.770
 by my mother so outside of that up until now you know it's kind

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.760
 of us come take a turn to be more focused you know you know as a students

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.760
 to apply them the things that I learned in school so no that's

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.750
 kind of how I describe myself as a student
