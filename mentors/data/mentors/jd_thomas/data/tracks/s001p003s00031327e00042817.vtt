00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.840
where you, um ao In great school, I would probably say I was Maur studios.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.840
 I was always into the books. I love reading. I love writing love,

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.830
 math and science and just enjoyed learning as I got older. Uh, the

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.820
 more I got into sports and the more I got into girls unless I focused

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.820
 on school. School came kind of easy to me in high school, so I can't

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.810
 remember too often like taking home a book because it came so natural

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.800
 to me. You know, I think my parents that helped me develop that

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.800
 foundation of, like being a quick learner and high school. I didn't

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.790
 have to study so much. College was kind of the same. I kind of felt,

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.780
 you know, fell in hard with the women and sports and less on studies.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.780
 So I really didn't focus my year college until my senior year,

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.770
 which I was challenged by my mother. So outside of that, up until now,

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.760
 you know, it's kind of it's kind of taken a turn to be more focused

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.760
 as a student toe. Apply the things that I learned in school, so

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.750
 that's kind of how I would describe myself as a student
