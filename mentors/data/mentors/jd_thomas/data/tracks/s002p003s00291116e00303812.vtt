00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.680
I would say the first thing is, in the military and the Navy, you can

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.510
 almost assume that there is an instruction for everything. So if you

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.340
 have a question about something, ask the question. Is there an instruction

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.170
 for If you're not sure about something, try to find an instruction

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.010
 for two. If you don't know something, ask if you're not sure.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.840
 Ask if you think you know, but you're not sure if you're 100% ask another

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.670
 thing. Communicate. If you want to do something, communicate.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.500
 Ask him one. Talk to someone about it. Talk to your chief about it.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.330
 I talked to your 1st 1st 1st class about it. Talk to your department

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.160
 head about it. There's no problem with communicating an issue or something

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.990
 that you may think of is an issue but might not be an issue.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.820
 But the problem is that the thing is, is that you brought it up. You

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.650
 ask the question. You talked about it. You communicate about, um,

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.490
 another thing. And this comes with a personal life is a balance. Find

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.320
 that balance off home life and work life. The navy is a lot to a

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.150
 lot of people But once you leave the Navy, if you ever leave the Navy,

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.980
 the Navy's going to keep going without you. So make sure that you

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.810
 find the balance of your personal life as well as your work life.
