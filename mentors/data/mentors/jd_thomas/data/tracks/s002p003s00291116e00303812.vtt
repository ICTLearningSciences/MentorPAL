I would say the first thing is in the military in the navy you can almost

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.510
 assume that there is an instruction for everything so if you have

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.340
 a question about something ask the question is there a structure for

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.170
 if you're not sure about something try to find an instruction for

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.010
 a two if you don't know something ask if you're not sure ask if you

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.840
 think you know but you're not sure if you are harvested ask another

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.670
 thing communicate if you want to do something communicate Ascham one

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.500
 talk to someone about it talk to you chief about it talk to you first

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.330
 first your first class about it talk to your department about it

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.160
 there's no problem with communicating an issue or something that you

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.990
 may think of is an issue but might not be an issue but the problem

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.820
 is that the thing is is that you brought it up you asked the question

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.650
 you talked about it you communicate about another thing and this

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.490
 comes with a personal life is balance find that balance of home life

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.320
 and work life the navy is a lot to a lot of people but once you leave

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.150
 the navy if you ever leave the navy the navy's going to keep going

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.980
 without you so make sure that you found the balance of your personal

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.810
 life as well as your work life
