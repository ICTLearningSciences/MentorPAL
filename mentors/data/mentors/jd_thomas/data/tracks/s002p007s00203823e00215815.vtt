00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.850
the most dangerous thing I've ever done on the job. Waas probably boat

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.840
 ops. As a boat officer, we had to transfer probably about 10 sailors

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.840
 from our DDG to a, um, a transport ship, which was, uh I can't remember

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.830
 exactly what type of ship it was, but it was like it was almost

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.830
 like a like I am messy run ship. So we had We had Thio transport about

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.820
 10 sailors from one ship to the next, and it was kind of like some

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.820
 some choppy water, so the seas were probably 45 foot seas, so the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.810
 boat was going up and down. You know, you're trying to get these people

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.810
 on and off the ship, and, you know, it was kind of nerve racking

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.800
 at the time. So as a boto, I was very concerned about the safety

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.800
 of the crew members who were on the boat more so than myself. So and

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.790
 also with, you know, the ddg trailing, you know, kind of offset. It

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.790
 was just a concerned about someone going in the water and, uh, having

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.780
 to, you know, worst case scenario, having informed someone's parents

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.780
 that their son or daughter is not coming home, so that's probably

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.770
 the most dangerous and the most scary. You know,
