Oh, wow. Um, so as a junior officer on board a new ship, the first thing

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.190
 that you're going to do is work. Uh, you're gonna work a lot. You're

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.870
 going to eat you asleep, and you're probably gonna work some more.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:23.540
 Uh, the thing here is, uh, to find time in between work, eating and

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:29.210
 sleeping to obtain your calls and devote, you know, say 1/10 of that

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.880
 time every day to some sort of leisure toe where you can stay sane.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.560
 Uh, it's humanly possible to, you know, we're even sleep, but everyone

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.230
 needs some downtime to, you know, to be able to function that

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.900
 at a decent capacity.
