00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.090
as far as relationships with those in charge again, you respond to verbal

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.330
 and nonverbal cues and also by keeping it professional and respectful.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.560
 Um, you have a lot off seniors who have, ah, difficult time responding

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.800
 to the new generation of sailors that are coming here. So

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.040
 it's kind of hard to for them to empathize and understand how to approach

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.280
 in interact with some of the younger service. And that's understandable.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.520
 But you as a a subordinate to, say a senior, you have to

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.760
 be able to understand that things aren't perfect. Take your ego out

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.990
 of it and find out what makes the boss t what makes them happy and what

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:53.230
 makes them happy. We'll make you happy because they're happy. So

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.470
 with that relationship, just do your best to keep it professional and

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.710
 respectful. If you keep it professional, you won't have to worry

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.950
 about anything going south. So nine times out of 10 don't respond with

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.190
 how you really feel. Just keep it professional and keep it respectful,

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.420
 because sometimes you may feel like you want to react like in

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.660
 a negative manner. But that won't go well for you. So keep professional

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.900
 and keep a respectful
