00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.420
as far as a relationship with those in charge again you respond to verbal

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.980
 and nonverbal cues and also by keeping a professional respectful

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.550
 you have a lot of seniors who I have a difficult time responding to

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.110
 the new generation of sailors that a company so it's kind of hard to

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.680
 for them to empathize and understand how to approach is in a rack

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.240
 with some of the younger sailors and that's understandable but you as

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.810
 a a subordinate to say a senior you have to be able to understand

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.370
 that things are personal take your ego out of it and find out what makes

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.940
 the boss to what makes them happy and what makes them happy will

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.510
 make you happy because there have so with that relationship just do

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.070
 your best to keep a professional and respectful if you give a fashion

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.640
 you won't have to worry about anything also so nine times out of

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.200
 ten don't respond with how you really feel just keep professional and

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.770
 he respects because sometimes you may feel like you want to react

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.330
 like in a negative manner but that won't go away or for you so keep

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.900
 professional give a respectful
