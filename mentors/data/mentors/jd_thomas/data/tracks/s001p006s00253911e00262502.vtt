00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.950
over my career my word a change based on the demands of the command in

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.050
 on the the the commanding officer so that's typically how your workday

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.150
 will change so how you operate an approach your work day prior to

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.250
 deployment will be totally different than how you operate and approach

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.360
 a work day after deployment the same can be said for dealing with

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.460
 inspection prior to an inspection say in in Sir you can expect that

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.560
 your command will have six maybe the seven day work weeks but you

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.660
 pass that inspection of that in Sir and you can expect that your work

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.760
 they'll be totally different
