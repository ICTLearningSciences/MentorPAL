00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.950
over my career. My word. They changed based on the demands of the command

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.050
 and on the the the commanding officer. So that's typically how your

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.150
 work they will change. So how you operate and approach your work

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.250
 day prior to deployment will be totally different than how you operate

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.360
 and approach the workday after a deployment. And the same can be

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.460
 said for dealing with inspections prior to inspection, say an insert.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.560
 You can expect that your command will have six, maybe even seven

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.660
 day work weeks. But you pass that inspection on that insert, and you

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.760
 can expect that your work there will be totally different.
