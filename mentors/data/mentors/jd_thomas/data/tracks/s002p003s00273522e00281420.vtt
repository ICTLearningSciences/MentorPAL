I think that's the $1,000,000 question of how do I work? Smarter, Not

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.600
 harder. Right. So Right. So how do you work? Smarter. You work smarter

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.470
 by being more efficient. You be more efficient by managing the time.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.340
 Managing resource is so getting together. But prior to the start

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.210
 of each day and my planning out your date, right? Not your tasks and

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.090
 your obligations of what needs to take place. Planning also reduces

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.960
 our workload. So plan ahead mended and organize your time manager

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.830
 time.
