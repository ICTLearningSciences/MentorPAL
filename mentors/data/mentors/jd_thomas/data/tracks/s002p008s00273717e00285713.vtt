00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.850
again. Short answer is yes. The longer answer is it Opinions. Um, I want

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 to say there's, ah rule in someone in one of the instructions that

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.840
 basically says that you're a lot. Your CEO is allowed to give you

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.840
 one beer every 44 days at sea, but you can almost guarantee that you

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.840
 will not be at sea for 44 days unless you absolutely have to. So, most

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.840
 of all, boys and most cares will pull in, um, under that 44 4 day

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.830
 limit while you're out steam and definitely not you won't be allowed

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.830
 alcohol. But once your import, it depends on the your CEO's discretion.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.830
 Chances are you'll be allowed to drink alcohol in the event that

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.830
 no one on the ship or let's say, within a strike group if you're

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.820
 operating within the strike group has had in like, alcohol related

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.820
 incidents. So when you do get to drink, just be on your best behavior

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.820
 and make it watch out for your buddies and to make sure that they're

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.820
 got not getting in any trouble or alcohol related incidents, which

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.810
 will calls you no more problems and people not being able allowed

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.810
 to drink
