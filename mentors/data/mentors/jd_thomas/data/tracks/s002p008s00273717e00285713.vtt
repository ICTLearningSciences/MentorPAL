hi again this short answer is yes the longer answer is it depends I want

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 to say there is a a rule in some in and one of the instructions that

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.840
 basically says that you're a lot your seal was allowed to give you

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.840
 one beer every forty four days at sea but you can almost guarantee

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.840
 that you will not be at sea for forty four days unless you absolutely

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.840
 have to so most small boys and most carriers will pull in under

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.830
 that forty four four day limit all while you're out Stephen definitely

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.830
 not you will be allowed alcohol but once you import it depends on

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.830
 the are your CIOS discretion chances are you'll be allowed to drink

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.830
 alcohol in the event that no one on the ship or let's say a within

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.820
 a strike group if you're operating within the strike group has had in

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.820
 like alcohol related incidents so when you do get a drink just be

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.820
 on your best behavior may watch out for your buddies and to make sure

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.820
 that their got not get in any trouble or alcohol related incidents

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.810
