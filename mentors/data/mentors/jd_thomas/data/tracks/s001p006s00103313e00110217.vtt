um, for a typical week, I'd probably say about maybe 80. Depend if you're

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.470
 deployed. It's probably about 70 80 import, I say about maybe 50

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:18.270
 55 on average, your typical day in port, you're probably working. I'd

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.080
 say about 12 hours a day at sea. I'd bump that up anywhere from 12

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.890
 toe 18 hours a day.
