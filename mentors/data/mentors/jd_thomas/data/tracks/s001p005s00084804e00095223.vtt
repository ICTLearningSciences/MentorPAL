00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.790
As my career progresses, I think I've found more balance. Early on, I

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.730
 was all career based career focused on, so if it didn't involve me progressing

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.660
 in the Navy, then I kind of put it on the back burner and

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.600
 I'm pretty sure I'll talk about a little bit later. But, um, I think

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.540
 as time is going on and I'm getting a little older, my priorities

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.480
 are kind of balancing out where I want Ah, home life as well as a an

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.410
 established career. So I was privileged to have a conversation with

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.350
 a senior once, and this is very recently and I would discuss retirement.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.290
 And he mentioned not being the only one at my retirement and that

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.230
 kind of hit home as saying, like when you get older, you don't wanna

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.160
 focus so much on your career that you alien nature of friends and

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.100
 family to where you're the only one standing there at your retirement
