00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.790
because my career progresses I think I've found more balance early on

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.730
 I was all career based on career focused on that so if it didn't involve

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.660
 me progressing in the navy then I kind of put on the back burner

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.600
 and I'm pretty sure I'll talk about a little bit later but I think

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.540
 as time is going on and get a little older of my priorities are kind

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.480
 of balancing out so where I want our home life as well as a an established

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.410
 career so hello I was privileged to have a conversation with

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.350
 a senior once and I just very recently and I would discuss retirement

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.290
 and he mentioned not being the only one at my retirement and that

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.230
 kinda hit home as saying like when you get older you don't want to

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.160
 focus so much on your career that you alienate your friends and family

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.100
 to where you're the only one standing there at your retirement
