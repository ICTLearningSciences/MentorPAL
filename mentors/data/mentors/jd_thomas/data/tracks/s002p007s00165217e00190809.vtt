00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.290
wow that's a that's a that's a tough one as a slow you take risks everyday

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.720
 and I've had to make risky decisions like I said just about two

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:17.160
 or three times a day there was some issue that involved to be taking

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.600
 a risk either on a sailor or on the program or just operate the ship

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.030
 the big thing here is to not kill anyone and not break anything and

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.470
 also understand that you have you know resources available that you're

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.910
 not alone and I think that was like the the big three but you

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.340
 take risks everyday and one in particular would be personnel issues

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.780
 there was at one time there was a a do you say that it was going through

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.220
 some problems with a a junior officer and do you also was actually

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.650
 making advances toward the junior sailor and I was approached by

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.090
 the Jews sailor and told the situation and I thought it was my best

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.530
 judgment was to hell it at the lowest level which was with me and informing

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.970
 my immediate supervisor which was a second tour debate division

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.400
 officer so proceeded to counsel the junior officer who is a little

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.840
 bit ahead of me at a time and for my second tour Divo and for while

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.280
 the issue was solved on to the Vance is kept happening and there

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.710
 I ended up bringing it up to a department head and after part we have

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.150
 gotten got window at doc told that part we hear about it of the CIOS

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.590
 informed on but because of my prior knowledge of the situation I

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.020
 received a letter reprimand simply because I had known about the situation

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.460
 for sometime so that was you could say I was a bad you know

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.900
 judgment on my end but I was want to risk because I I took you know

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.330
 is you don't want to be a good leader want to you know be able to handle

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.770
 the situation at the lowest level so
