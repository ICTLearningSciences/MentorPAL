00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.290
Wow, that's a That's a That's a tough one. Um, as a swot, you take risks

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.720
 every day, and I've had thio make risky decisions. Like I said, just

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:17.160
 about two or three times a day, there was some issue that involved

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.600
 me taking a risk either on a sailor or on a program or just operating

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.030
 ship. The big thing here is toe not kill anyone and not break anything.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.470
 Um, and also understand that you have resource is available,

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.910
 that you're not alone. Uh, and I think that was like the big three.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.340
 But you take risks every day, and one in particular would be personnel

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.780
 issues. Um, there was, Ah, one time there was a ah junior sailor

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.220
 that was going through some problems with a junior officer and Julie

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.650
 Officer was actually making advances toward the junior sailor. And

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.090
 I was approached by the junior sailor and told the situation, and

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.530
 I thought it was my best judgment was to Hamlet at the lowest level,

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.970
 which was with me and informing my immediate supervisor, which was

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.400
 a second tour division officer. So I proceeded to counsel the junior

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.840
 officer who was a little bit ahead of me at the time, and I formed

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.280
 my second tour, Devo and, um for while the issue was solved until the

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.710
 advances kept happening and I ended up bringing it up to a department

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.150
 head and after department had gotten got window after I told that

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.590
 department it about it, that Seo was informed. But because of my prior

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.020
 knowledge to the situation, I received a letter reprimand simply

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.460
 because I had known about the situation for some time. So that was

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.900
 you could say, I was a bad judgment on my end, but I was one of the

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.330
 risks I took. You know, as you want to be a good leader, want to be

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.770
 able to handle a situation at the lowest level, so
