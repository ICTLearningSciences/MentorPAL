00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.340
the one question I wish I would have asked earlier. Um, and it's also

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.840
 another question that I ask off a lot of seniors is how do you get,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.330
 How do I get better? Two. In becoming the person I envisioned myself

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.820
 being once I retire. So I think we all as human beings want to be the

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.320
 best husband, wife, father, mother, aunt, uncle friend, uh, commanding

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.810
 officer, Master chief or whatever it may be, you want to be the

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:39.300
 best at it. You want to be good at it. You want to be looked at as

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.800
 being a a, uh, leader in that field in terms off. You know how people

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.290
 look up to you, a role model in that field. So that's one question

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.780
 that I I wish I would have asked myself early on, even in childhood,

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.280
 is How do I How do I improve? How do I get better? What things do

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.770
 I need to do to become a better person?
