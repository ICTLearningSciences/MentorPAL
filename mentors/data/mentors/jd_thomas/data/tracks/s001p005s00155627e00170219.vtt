00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.840
 another question that I ask of a lot of seniors is how do you get

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.330

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.820
 being once our car so I think we all as human beings want to be the

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.320
 best husband wife father mother on all cool friend commanding officer

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.810

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:39.300
 you want to be good at it you want to be looked at as being a a a leader

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.800
 in that field in terms of you know how people look up to you a

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.290
 role model in that field so that's one question that out I wish I would

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.780
 have asked myself early on even in childhood is how do I how do

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.280
