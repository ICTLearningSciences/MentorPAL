00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.000
the physical environment where I worked it very may do so typically has

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.140
 a a first tour you're standing bridge watch or combat watch so bridge

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.290
 watch depending on where you are located in the world it could be

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.430
 colder than me hot it would be warm it could be humid but it was very

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.580
 rewarding because you can you know you're always you know privileged

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.720
 to have the sunshine or did the elements out of combat watch is

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.870
 always cold they have to keep the equipment coal so going from the

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.010
 bridge down to combat is like walking from say a sauna to a freezer

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.160
 and sin in the freezer often during training your typically walking

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.300
 through the main spaces and the main spaces can reach upwards of a hundred

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.450
 degrees on average because of all the machinery and all the fluids

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.590
 and all the heat that's generated so it it just varies in Japan

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.740
 so you have to kinda be ready for you know everything
