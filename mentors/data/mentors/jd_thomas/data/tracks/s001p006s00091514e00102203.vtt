00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.000
the physical environment where I worked it very so. Typically has a first

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.140
 tour. You're standing bridge watch or combat watch, so bridge watch.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.290
 Depending on where you are located in the world, it could be cold.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.430
 It could be high. It'll be warm. It could be humid, but it was very

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.580
 rewarding because you could, you know, you're always privileged

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.720
 to have the sunshine or the elements out. Combat watches always cold.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.870
 They have to keep the equipment cold, so going from the bridge down

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.010
 to combat is like walking from, say, asana to a freezer and sitting

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.160
 in the freezer off. During training. You're typically walking through

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.300
 the main spaces, and the main bases can reach upwards of 100 degrees

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.450
 on average because of all the machinery and all the fluids and

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.590
 all the heat that's generated, so it just varies. It depends, So you

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.740
 have to kind of be ready for, you know, everything
