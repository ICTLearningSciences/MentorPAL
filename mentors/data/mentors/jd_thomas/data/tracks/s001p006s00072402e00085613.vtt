00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.460
so on a typical day on the USS Lassen as repair officer of my day typically

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.060
 started very early anywhere from four to five AM dependent on

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.670
 the watch schedule an opinion on if we were in port or at sea out just

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.270
 kind of in a blend in a couple things the main thing was to be visit

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.880
 be present and to to know before your bosses know and always give

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.480
 out clear communication so in order to do that you have to be up early

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.090
 and make around so I would get up early get ready you know which

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.690
