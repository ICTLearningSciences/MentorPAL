00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.460
so on a typical day on the U. S. Has lasted as repair officer. My day

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.060
 typically started very early, anywhere from 4 to 5 a.m. dependent on

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.670
 the white schedule and depending on if we were in port or etc. Just

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.270
 kind of blend in a couple of things. The main thing was to be be present

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.880
 and to know before your bosses no, and always give out clear communication.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.480
 So in order to do that, you have to be up early and make

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.090
 around. So I would get up early, get ready, you know, which includes,

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.690
 like you know, your shower and everything. And then you get up

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.300
 and you want you making rounds. Walk your spaces. Make sure that your

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.910
 sailor see you out there early in the morning. And I often head up

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.510
 to the quarterdeck to see if there are any issues of within my personnel

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.120
 or something that I need to be notified off after that, you know,

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.720
 grab a quick breakfast and just go see a division walk around before

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.330
 quarters, meet them at quarters, you know, just kind of playing

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.930
 out your day from there. That kind of goes around your wife's schedule,

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.540
 your training schedule and you're studying schedule because you're

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.140
 always qualified. You're always trying to qualify for something,

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.750
 so you have to fit those three things in White's division training,

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.350
 why it's division training and that this that was basically my day,

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.960
 every day.
