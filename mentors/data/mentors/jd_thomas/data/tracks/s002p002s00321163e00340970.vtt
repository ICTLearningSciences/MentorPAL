00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.570
so a number of ways that you can affect morale is for one your personally.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.300
 It's about being positive. Um, and I would like to think that a

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.020
 positive attitude is contagious. So the more you're smiling, the more

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.740
 that you're being positive about things. The more others will be

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.460
 positive about things on board, like certain ships are every ship that

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.190
 I have been on. I had the privilege of being on. There are definitely

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.910
 a number of activities that you can engage in which you start with

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.630
 each other to, you know, help building around. There's bingo night.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.360
 There's, Ah, video game night. There's our hop night where you know

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.080
 the CS is Get around and they cook. I hopped pancakes for an omelet

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.800
 for dinner. You know that ice cream night? There's pizza and Chicken

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.520
 wing night, but also you have certain activities that sometimes

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.250
 that the captain will push, which are like they allow beards. So you

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.970
 pay the into the nwr fun, say, three bucks or so, and you can grow

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.690
 your beard out. Do you? You know, you come back in port, so you know,

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.410
 that's like a big morale booster. Believe it or not? Is it zip? It

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.140
 may seem very small, but something like that will build morale very

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.860
 quickly If I don't have to get up and say you everyone and I can walk

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.580
 around with beer. Um, but things like that, um, those air about,

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.310
 you know, just about the limits that a person can do or someone can

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.030
 do to affect morale. When you have obligations to meet outside of that,

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.750
 you know, put import as often as you are allowed to and getting

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.470
 off the ship and just been able to decompress and are going tours and

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.200
 see things. And, uh, those are about the best that you can do to

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.920
 build around.
