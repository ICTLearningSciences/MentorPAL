00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.770
soul of a number of ways that you can affect morale is for one of your

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.680
 personally this might be a positive and I like to think that a positive

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.600
 attitude is contagious so the more you're smiling the more that

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.520
 sure of being positive about things the more others will be positive

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.440
 about things on board like certain ships why or every ship that I've

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.350
 been on had a privilege to be in awe there are definitely a number

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.270
 of activities that you know you can engage in which you start with

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.190
 each other to you know help build morale there's bingo night there

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.110
 is a video game night there is our our hot night where you know the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.020
 the CS is get around in a cook I hop pancakes were an omelets for dinner

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.940
 you know there's ice cream night there's pizza and chicken wing

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.860
 night but also you have certain activities that sometimes that the

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.780
 the captain will push which are a lie they'll allow beards so you pay

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.690
 the into the MW are fine say three Bucks or so you can grow your beard

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.610
 out do you you know you come back in port so you know that's a

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.530
 lack of a big morale booster believe it or not is it's it's it may seem

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.450
 very small something like that will build morale very quickly if

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.360
 I don't have to get up to save everyone and I can walk around with

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.280
 beer but things like that those are about you know just what the limits

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.200
 that you know a person can do or someone can do to affect morale

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.120
 when you have obligations to to meet outside of that you know pulling

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.030
 import as often as you're allowed to and you know get off the ship

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.950
 and just been able to decompress and our goal tours and see things

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.870
 in those about the best that you can do to build around
