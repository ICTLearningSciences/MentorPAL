00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.570
and so a number of ways that you can affect morale is for one, you're

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.290
 personally. It's about being positive, and I would like to think that

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.010
 a positive attitude is contagious. So the more you're smiling, the

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.730
 more that you're being positive about things. The more others will

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.450
 be positive about things on board. Like certain ships. You are every

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.170
 ship that I've been on. I had the privilege of being on. There are

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.900
 definitely a number of activities that you can engage in which you start

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.620
 with each other to, you know, help building around. There's bingo

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.340
 night. There's a video game night. There's our I hop night where

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.060
 you know the C S is get around and they cook. I hot pancakes for an

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.780
 omelets for dinner. You know that ice cream night? There's pizza and

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.500
 Chicken wing night, but also you have certain activities that sometimes

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.220
 that the captain will push, which are like they'll allow beards

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.940
 so you pay the into the MW are fun, say, three bucks or so, and you

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.660
 can grow your beard out. Do you? You know, you come back in port, so

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.380
 you know, that's like a big morale booster believe it or not, is it

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.100
 zip? It may seem very small, but something like that will build morale

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.820
 very quickly if I don't have to get up and save everyone and I

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.550
 could walk around with beer. But things like that, um, those air about,

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.270
 you know, just about the limits that a person can do or someone

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.990
 can do to affect morale when you have obligations to meet outside of

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.710
 that, you know, putting import as often as you are allowed to and getting

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.430
 off the ship. Just been able to decompress and are going tours

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.150
 and see things. And, uh, those are about the best that you can do

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.870
 to build around.
