00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.940
the risk that you'll need to take in this field in terms of personnel

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.030
 with finding that balance of being a sword or a shield on what I mean

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.120
 by that has been being able to stick up knowing win, to stick up for

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.210
 your team members and knowing when to fight for your team members.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.310
 A CE faras risks in terms off career altogether Um, you're definitely

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.400
 take some risk. Personally, uh, you take a lot of risk by joining

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.490
 the military and joined the Navy in particular, where you risk being

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.580
 out on deployment anywhere from 6 to 11 months. And that can have,

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.670
 ah, huge effect on your personal life. So those are two things that

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.760
 I can say sticks out as far as risk.
