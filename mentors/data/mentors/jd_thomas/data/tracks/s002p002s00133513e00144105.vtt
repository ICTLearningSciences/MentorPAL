00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.920
you're pushers, your team to meet standards. You. It's simple early and

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.990
 often you communicate your standards and what's expected of them,

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.060
 and you reinforce those expectations early and often by being present

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:21.130
 by being around them. By displaying those standards by pushing those

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.200
 standards by encouraging them to meet those standards, it'll it might

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.270
 take time. Some teams take longer than others, and you'll eventually

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.350
 get there. But one key thio this method is you also have to, um,

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.420
 you also have to. I'm trying to figure out the words to say You have

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.490
 to lay out a plan to get there so you can't leave the blind if you're

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.560
 blind, blind, can't lead the black so established A plan to get

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.630
 to those standards and take your team throughout those steps and move

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.700
 forward, Move accordingly. That's that's That's one way that I could

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.770
 I could think of
