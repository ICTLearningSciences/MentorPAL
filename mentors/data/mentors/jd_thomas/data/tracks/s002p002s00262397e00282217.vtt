00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.480
um, the big difference between working privacy you're in, like, say, is

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.110
 working in the military, uh, would be the for one the tempo to the

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.740
 stress level. And three. It's kind of tough to explain, but there's

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.360
 there in the military you you're always under like the watchful eye

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.990
 of something that I think that's the big thing. It's like you're you're

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.620
 always under the microscope when you're in the military. So everything

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.250
 that you say you do, you're being like scrutinized for you,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.880
 man. Watch for, say, for example, incident happens out in town, and

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.510
 I'm in my uniform the difference between me being in that incident as

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.140
 a civilian between and now, you know, in my uniform it's looked at

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.760
 as, Hey, Naval Officer did X, y and Z. But if I was as a civilian,

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.390
 it will just be J. D. V. This, you know, you represent a larger ah group

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.020
 of people, a larger organization and I think that plays ah big

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.650
 part into a person's like a day to day operations as faras the differences,

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.280
 but also you get there. You know, there's like a different,

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.910
 um, sense of. I guess you could say freedom as a civilian, as opposed

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.540
 to been in the military. Because every day I think I like, Hey, I'll

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.160
 be I don't I won't be I won't be anywhere permanently So this is

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.790
 temporary for me, So I always have to go back to see I'll always be

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.420
 moving. So those just, ah, few things that play into you know, the difference

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.050
 is, I guess.
