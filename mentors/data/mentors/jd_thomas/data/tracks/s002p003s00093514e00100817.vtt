00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.570
There's a couple of warning signs that I looked for it and problems within

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.290
 the team, and that's Ah, selfishness is one and ego. I go by another

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.010
 notion of big team little me. So if you incorporate your ego into

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.720
 a team and it becomes too big, then you put yourself over the team.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.440
 And then also, if you're acting selfishly, I marks the team. If

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.160
 you're putting yourself before the team, those two things are definitely

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.880
 big warrants that.
