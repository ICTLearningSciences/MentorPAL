00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.260
so a cz far as having time for hobby. You will have time depending on

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:11.670
 your personal situation. So and that depends on your family requirements

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.090
 and your family demands and the demands placed on you by the command.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.500
 So, me personally, for example, I'm in a student status here

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.910
 in P s. So I have ample time outside of my study and school requirements.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.320
 I personally like fishing, and I'd like to do things like bowling

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.730
 and working on cars and things of that nature. So that's typically

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.140
 what I do. Go to the beach. I go fishing, work on cars or personal

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.560
 restoration projects, and I go Boldin and traveling. So, uh, short

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.970
 answers. That depends on your personal situation. You know, you'll

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.380
 find time to do the things that you love, given what you have to do.
