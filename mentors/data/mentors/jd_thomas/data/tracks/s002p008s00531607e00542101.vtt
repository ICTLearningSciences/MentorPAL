00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.750
so as far as having time for hobbies you will have time depending on your

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.660
 personal situation so and that depends on your family requirements

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.560
 and your family demands and the met the demands placed on you by

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.460
 the command so me personally for example I'm in a student status here

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.370
 in PS so I have ample time outside of my thirty and school requirements

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:36.270
 I personally like Fishin and I like to do days like bowling and

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.180
 working on cars and things of that nature so that's typically what

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.080
 I do I go to the beach I go Fishin work on cars or personal restoration

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.980
 projects and I go bowling and traveling so short answer is it depends

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.890
 on your personal situation you know you'll find time to do the

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.790
 things that you love given what you have to do
