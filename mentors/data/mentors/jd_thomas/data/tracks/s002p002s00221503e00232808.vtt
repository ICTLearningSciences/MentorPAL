00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.070
things that encouraged accountability are, um, one of my favorites. Uh,

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.290
 this would be ownership. So throughout your command, throughout your

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.500
 division, throughout your department and even, you know, just in

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.720
 general, people respond better when they feel as if they own something.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.940
 And that simple notion will encourage someone to be accountable

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.160
 for their equipment before a program. So throughout your team to develop

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.370
 or encourage accountability would be to give a sailor program and

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.590
 sit down and communicate with them your expectations and your standards

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.810
 and encourage them to make this program the best or, you know,

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.030
 to pass an expectation, you know, whatever it may be. But that sense

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.250
 of ownership encourages accountability alone. But you just have to

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.460
 be the leader, too. Find that that that sailor, that you can apply

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.680
 to that program Thio, you know, move forward. So ownership encourages

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.900
 accountability in my pain
