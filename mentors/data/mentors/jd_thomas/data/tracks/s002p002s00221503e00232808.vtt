00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.070
all the things that I encourage accountability are one of my favorites

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.290
 this would be ownership so throughout your command throughout your

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.500
 division throughout your department and even you know just in general

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.720
 people respond better when they feel as if they own something and

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.940
 that simple you know notion will encourage someone to be accountable

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.160
 for their equipment before program so throughout your team to develop

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.370
 or encourage accountability would be to give a sailor program and

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.590
 sit down and communicate with them your expectations in your standards

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.810
 and encourage them to make this program the bass door you know to

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.030
 pass an expansion you know whatever it may be but that sense of ownership

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.250
 encourages accountability along but you just have to be the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.460
 leaders to find that that that sailor that you can apply to that program

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.680
 you know move for so ownership encourages accountability mopping

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.900
