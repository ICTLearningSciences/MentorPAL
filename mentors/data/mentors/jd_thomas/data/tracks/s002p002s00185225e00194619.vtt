00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.000
um, simple words of advice for me, for someone to understand, to get to

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.150
 know their bosses would be to listen. Listen, in the observant again,

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.300
 you'll be able to see the things they do. You'll hear the things

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.450
 that they talk about. And as time goes on, they will open up to you

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.600
 about the things that they like to do, the things that they like to

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.750
 talk about. And that'll be your opportunity. Thio, you know, find some

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.890
 common area that you guys share. I like fishing. So chances are

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.040
 if we walk by, we were walking and you were a subordinate of mine. And

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.190
 we're walking by, say, I don't know efficient pollen or something.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.340
 You might hear me say something like, You know, I wish I had a ride

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.490
 or something. I could go fishing right now and that'll be your opportunity.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.640
 It's simple and subtle. Things like that. Uh, just listen

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.790
 and observe
