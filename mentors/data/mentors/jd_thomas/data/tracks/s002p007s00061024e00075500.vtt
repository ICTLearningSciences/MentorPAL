00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.610
the biggest failure that I have ever have a problem to be being kicked

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.370
 out of flight school as an answer it definitely made me feel the lowest

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.140
 of the low I felt like a total loser and that life was pretty much

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.900
 coming to an end I feel like I left my family that I let my family

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.660
 down my friends down my community down but most of all let myself

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.420
 down but that was a learning lesson and did help me to build a strong

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.180
 relationship with god you know because once you're in a situation

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.940
 like that we feel like you lose and everything you go back to what

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.710
 you know and that's you know Hey I need to talk to somebody in that

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.470
 somebody was gone out for me and he definitely taught me to be a more

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.230
 positive person to always look at the bright side to always look at

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.990
 the the positive things in life is and people and it also prompted

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.750
 me to become more of a surge warfare officer and I felt like that was

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.520
 like the biggest and best thing for me you know possible Bennis was

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.280
 amazing the little leadership opportunities that I get day in and

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.040
 day out from a peer standpoint from a subordinate stamp form and even

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.800
 as a dip division officer and you know some day soon the department

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.560

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.320
 different backgrounds that you're able to interact with everyday
