WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.610
the biggest failure that I've ever had would probably be being kicked

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.370
 out of flight school as an answer. It definitely made me feel the lowest

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.140
 of the low. I felt like a total loser, and that life was pretty

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.900
 much coming to an end. I felt like I left my family that I let my family

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.660
 down, my friends down my community down. But most of all, I let

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.420
 myself down. But that was a learning lesson and it helped me to build

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.180
 a strong relationship with God. You know, because once you're in

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.940
 a situation like that, when you feel like you're losing everything,

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.710
 you go back to what you know, and that's you know, Hey, I need to talk

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.470
 to somebody and that somebody was got for me And he definitely taught

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.230
 me to be a more positive person to always look at the bright side

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.990
 to always look at the positive things in life and in people. And

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.750
 it also prompted me to become ah, surface warfare officer, and I felt

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.520
 like that was like the biggest and best thing for me, you know, possible

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.280
 being a swot is amazing. The leadership opportunities that I

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.040
 get day in and day out from appear standpoint from ah, subordinate

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.800
 standpoint and even as a division officer and you know, someday soon

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.560
 the department here, the leadership opportunities among diverse and

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.320
 you know, different backgrounds that you're able to interact with every

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.090
 day. It's just endless, and you know, it just your toolbox just

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.850
 constantly feels up with tools and Maur things to learn and more things

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.610
 to do, and it's amazing.
