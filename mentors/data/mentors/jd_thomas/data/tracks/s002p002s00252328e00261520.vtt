00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.040
it's a it's a working with saves the worker was very is is is totally

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.230
 different civilians are more relaxed they're more casual there are peaceful

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.430
 sailors are R. at times very how strong because they're so used

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.620
 to operating under certain environments and that's kind of like

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.810
 how well what kind of compared to like a year and a Yankee there's like

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.000
 a high strong you know go go go go go sailor mentality but then

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.190

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.580
 I think that's just a big difference it's just the the temple that we

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.770
 operate on
