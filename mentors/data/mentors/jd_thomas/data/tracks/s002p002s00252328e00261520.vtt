00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.040
um, it's a working with saying Isn't working with the V's is totally different.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.230
 Civilians are Maur relaxed. They're more casual. There are

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.430
 peaceful sailors are are at times very high, strong because they're

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.620
 so used to operating under certain environments. And that's kind of

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.810
 like how well, we're kind of compare it to like a yin and the yang

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.000
 there's like Ah, hi, strong, you know, Go, go, go, go, go sailor mentality.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.190

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.390
 back it down Here's what we need to do So it sze awesome working

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.580
 with severe And I think that's just a big difference is just the tempo

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.770
 that we operate on.
