I think these small communities very accepting a failure effort is just

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.590
 about everything. Um, as a joo as a person. If you're striving to,

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.960
 you know, do better. You're doing all the right things, but you're

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.320
 coming up short. There will always be someone senior, some Pierre, even

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.690
 subordinates that are there to support you and help you get through

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.060
 in your deal.
