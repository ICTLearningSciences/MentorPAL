00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.620
conflict is normal all all around. A lot of people avoid it. Some people

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.380
 look forward to it, but conflict it's it's a part of job. Just imagine

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.150
 that you're you've got new personalities, different personalities,

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.910
 different people from all walks of life, all different backgrounds.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.680
 I mean, it's Ah, it's kind of a Milton pot. So you put all of these

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.450
 people in one small area. You're bound to have a confident. The

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.210
 key here is to be able to solve that conflict and move forward and

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.980
 continue in a continue to operate in a positive and productive working

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.750
 environment. You don't have to be someone friends who worked with

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.510
 him just respect and respect them and be cordial. And that's how you

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.280
 just move forward. Just don't hold on to those negative issues and

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.040
 those negative thoughts in those, uh, those problems. Just solve it

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.810
 and move forward and just always be respectful
