00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.760
free time. What is that? Uh, but, um uh, it depends on you know, the your

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.680
 ship. Schedule your command schedule as well. As you know, if you're

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.590
 on shore duty or sea duty right now, I'm sure duty student status

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.510
 here in P s. But my workload is very happy. This quarter have 18

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.420
 hours of credits and which kind of question? About five classes. So

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.330
 here, time management plays probably like the most important role in

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.250
 everything. I do my best to not study on weekends, say, Saturday and

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.160
 Sunday, which means that Monday through Friday, 12 to 14 hours and

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.080
 class, or in the library studying so that I can have Saturday Sunday

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.990
 as free.
