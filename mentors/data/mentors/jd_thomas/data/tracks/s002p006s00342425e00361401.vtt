00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.840
So you're moving to a new location or say a new command. First thing you

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.830
 should do is reach out to your sponsor. Typically, commands will

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.820
 sign a sponsor to you because you're a new addition to the command.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.810
 And that person will be, you know, similar in rain age. Or, you know,

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.800
 something similar to what you have and what you are. Excuse me. So

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.780
 reach out to that sponsor. If you haven't gotten a sponsor, reach out

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.770
 to the command 99% of time. Each command has a website, uh, thio

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.760
 get in touch with and that command typically probably four or five months

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.750
 or maybe even further out. Maybe about a year before you're due

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.740
 to arrive, they'll send out a welcome aboard package, which includes

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.730
 names, sponsor name, phone numbers, command information, email addresses

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.720
 and things of that nature. It will also allow you to get in

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.710
 touch with, say, the command on Budge Mint, which is typically a navy,

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.700
 a spouse of someone in the command who's in charge of helping your

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.690
 family get acclimated to the new area and you'll reach out through

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.680
 your sponsor. And through that welcome aboard package, you'll be able

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.660
 to find schools, living areas, housing opportunities, Religious service

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.650
 is just about any and everything that you may need that those

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.640
 personnel will be able to help you out. Another resource would be the

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.630
 command CMC on the CMC, which is the command master chief. So he

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.620
 or she will always have a plethora of resource is toe help you get acclimated

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.610
 to the new command and the new area.
