00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.840
so you're moving to a new location or say a new command first thing you

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.830
 should do is reach out to your sponsor typically commands will sign

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.820
 a sponsor to you because you're a new addition to the command and

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.810
 that person will be you know similar in rain age or you know something

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.800
 similar to what you have and what you are excuse me so reach out

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.780
 to that sponsor if you haven't got a sponsor reach out to the command

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.770
 nine and I'm set a time each command has a website to get in touch

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.760
 with and that command typically probably you know for five months or

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.750
 maybe even further out maybe about a year before your due to arrive

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.740
 they'll send out a welcome aboard package which includes names of

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.730
 sponsor name phone numbers command information email addresses and things

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.720
 of that nature it will also allow you to get in touch with say

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.710
 the command all but some in which is typically a navy a spouse of someone

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.700
 in the command who's in charge of helping your family get acclimated

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.690
 to the new area and you'll reach out through your sponsor and

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.680
 through that welcome aboard package you'll be able to find schools

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.660
 living areas housing opportunities religious services just about any

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.650
 and everything that you made the that those parts they'll be able

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.640
