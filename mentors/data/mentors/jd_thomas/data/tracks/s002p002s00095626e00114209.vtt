00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.890
I think that appears on the person that appears on you though is there's

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.930
 no no one one size fits all type thing so you can't say with this

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.970
 type of person I'm going to do this but with this type of person I'm

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.010
 going to do that you have to learn and you know just kind of gain

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.050
 that experience by doing you won't be successful in every matter but

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.090
 what you can do is communicate you can sit down with the sailors say

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.130
 Hey you know I'm trying to establish this kind of culture I'm trying

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.170
 to do X. Y. Z. and respond to feedback that's the big thing communicate

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.210
 and respond to feedback so if you are you see something's not

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.250
 working with a certain sailor trust all the different now what's the

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.280
 worst that can happen if you go talk to someone really nothing so

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.320
 come cut communicate sit down and talk with that's how you that's how

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.360
 you move forward as how you deal with a wide multitude of people you

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.400
 communicate you listen you observe watch how they respond to you

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.440
 when you say certain things watch how they respond with certain other

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.480
 things happen for example I knew certain sailors didn't you know respond

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.520
 well to you know me screaming and yelling or you know just being

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.560
 very you know playful or something so you wouldn't be that way with

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.600
 that same or you know what I mean you just have to respond accordingly

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.640
 so but always observe and listen more you speak and follow their

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.680
 verbal and nonverbal cues that's basically it
