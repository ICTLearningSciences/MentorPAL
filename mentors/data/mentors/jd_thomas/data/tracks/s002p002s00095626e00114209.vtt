I think that depends on the person that depends on you. Um, though is

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.470
 there's no no 11 size fits all type thing, So you can't say with this

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.280
 type of person, I'm going to do this, but with this type of person,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.090
 I'm going to do that. You have to learn and, you know, just kind of

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.900
 gain that experience by doing it. You won't be successful in every

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.710
 matter, but what you can do is communicate. You can sit down with the

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.520
 sailor and say, Hey, you know I'm trying. Thio established this kind

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.330
 of culture. I'm trying to do X, Y and Z and respond to feedback.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.140
 That's the big thing. Communicate and respond to Phoebe. So if you

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.950
 see something's not working with a certain sailor, try something different.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.770
 What's the worst that could happen if you go talk to someone,

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.580
 really nothing. So communicate. Sit down and talk with. That's how

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.390
 you that's how you move forward. That's how you deal with a wide multitude

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.200
 of people. You communicate, you listen. You observe, watch how

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.010
 they respond to you. When you say certain things, watch how they

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.820
 respond with certain other things happen for example, I knew certain

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.630
 sailors didn't, you know, respond well to me screaming and yelling

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.440
 or, you know, just being very playful or something. So you wouldn't

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.250
 be that way with that sailor. You know what I mean? You just have to

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.060
 respond accordingly. So but always, uh, observe and listen more than

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.870
 you speak and follow their verbal and nonverbal cues. That's basically

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.680
 it.
