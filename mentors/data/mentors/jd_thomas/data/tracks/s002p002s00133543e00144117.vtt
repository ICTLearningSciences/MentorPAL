00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.910
you're pushers your team to meet standards, do you? It's simple early

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.960
 and often you communicate your standards and what's expected of them.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.020
 And you reinforced those expectations early enough by being present

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.080
 by being around them by displaying those standards by pushing those

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.130
 standards by encouraging them to meet those standards, it'll it might

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.190
 take time. Some teams take longer than others, and you will eventually

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:36.250
 get there. But one key Teoh this method is you also have to,

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.310
 um, you also have to. I'm trying to figure out the words to say You

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.360
 have to lay out a plan to get there so you can't lead the blind if you're

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.420
 blind blind. Can't leave the blood so established A plan to get

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.480
 to those standards and take your team throughout those steps and move

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.530
 forward. Move accordingly. That's that's one way that I couldn't

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.590
 I could think of
