00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.930
nuke qualifications. It depends on the requirements assed faras qualifications.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.020
 But in terms off personality traits, um, work ethic is a big

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.100
 one. Initiative is a big one. Um, attitude is a big so those are

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.190
 probably be three huge factors in terms of looking for a team member.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.270
 Other things you can kind of develop and work to develop going forward.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.360
 But if they have a work effort, work ethic, that's like half the

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.440
 battle because of you, a person works hard and they take the initiative

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.530
 to do something. That's kind of ah, what a lot of people in the

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.610
 Navy say a fire forget because I can ask a person to do something.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.700
 And before I'm finished with my question, there is already halfway

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.780
 done, so work ethic is is huge for me.
