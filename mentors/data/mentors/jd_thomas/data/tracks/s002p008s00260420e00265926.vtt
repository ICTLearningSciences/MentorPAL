00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.360
the short answer to that is yes. Um, longer answer is it depends on on

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.860
 the situation. Of course, ships are meant to be at sea, and they move

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.370
 a lot. So depending on the requirements of the command and demands

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.870
 for the missions that they're they're set to meet, you may be at what's

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:28.380
 called River City, which the CEO shuts down all outside communication

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.890
 outside of, uh, mission necessary calms. So your e mails, your

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.390
 Facebooks, all that kind of stuff wouldn't work. Even the phones

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.900
 are shut down, but typically, why you're out to sea and your steam.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.400
 You have access to email, you may be allowed to get on Facebook, and

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.910
 that's kind of actual seals discretion. And you have phone calls.
