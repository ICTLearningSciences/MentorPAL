00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.380
all right. I've done number ways for you to decompress and actually slow

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.900
 down. Um, let's go with first by being at home. Home port? Well,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.430
 being important. So you're on a ship and you're important. One way to

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.950
 decompress would be on the right home and a right to work. Used that

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.480
 quiet time to gather your thoughts, to focus your thoughts, to shift

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.010
 gears from being full throttle at work, to going home to re prioritizing

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.530
 things by being with your family. So keep this in mind. Never

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:37.060
 take your work home, Leave work at work. And so when you walk outside

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.590
 of that, uh, offer the quarterdeck, take your hard hat off, take

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.110
 cover off figuratively and leave it at work. So you go home, Go be

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.640
 with your family on that ride home. Decompress. Get those thoughts

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.160
 out. Think about things that you that don't involve work. And then when

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.690
 you get home, focus on your family while you're deployed, say, on

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.220
 the ship for a time period, you decompress by working out by doing

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.740
 and being actively engaged in certain hobbies that you might you might

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.270
 be involved in. I think about things like maybe playing video games,

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.800
 reading magazines, reading a book. There's, ah, brief period before

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.320
 you say you're about to go hit the rack for the night. Take about

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.850
 20 minutes. Thio. You know, pray, read a book, watch a movie, watch

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.370
 video, watch something to help decompress prior to going to sleep.
