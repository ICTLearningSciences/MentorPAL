Wow, that's that's kind of a easy one on. Nowadays, with the advances

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.840
 in technology, it's kind of easy. Typically, every ship you know has

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.340
 or every command has computers available for you to, you know, do work

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.840
 with an access S O. You know, whenever you have time, you know,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.330
 just get on and get on the say, facebook for a few minutes, we'll get

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.830
 onto your email and your family have, like, a ship email and you get

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.320
 email, you know, every so often or, you know, whenever you have time

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.820
 to email your family, face a Facebook, your family if it's allowed.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.320
 Also, sometimes the ships have phones. I think like carriers have

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.810
 phones that you can you still use calling cars and call home. Um,

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.310
 but typically, I would keep in touch with my family and friends and

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.810
 significant others through e mail while we're out to sea. And once you

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.300
 pull into port just like the rest of the ship, you will be searching

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.800
 for WiFi and trying to log on so that you can call home and call

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.290
 your mom and call you your girl or your boy. Uh, you know, whatever

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.790
 that may be. So
