    about two hundred pounds two we had to get it from off the ship which was on the
    pier to the folks of the front of the ship all the way to the bottom of the ship
    in order to have an install but this part with about two hundred pounds so %HESITATION
    I had just come off why us and we were rounded up you know everyone to see if
    we can get this thing down there and %HESITATION it took us about fifteen twenty
    minutes to round up everyone because you people are scattered throughout the ship
    so once we got everybody rounded up %HESITATION we located a %HESITATION like
    a shaft that led all the way to the bottom of the ship from the folks so the idea
    was to have a crane low the %HESITATION part on to this the fo''c''sle and you
    know lower downforce easy day well wow the crane was sweet like bringing the the
    part on board the %HESITATION shaft on the crane broke so they had to set the
    crane down so he well it ended up on the folks but we still have to get to the
    bottom of the ship this thing wait about two hundred pounds and their weight so
    we were %HESITATION actually you know being rushed and %HESITATION you know the
    captain just kind of walk through and just kinda notice like what was going on
    so he ended up giving me the look like you know what you''re going to now right
    so %HESITATION we had everybody here so we grabbed a boatswain''s mate and asked
    in a tie a few not and we %HESITATION tied up to par and it took probably about
    ten of us and we Horsted it down but I think it was about maybe like seven flight
    so %HESITATION of stairs or something to light lowered down to the bottom of this
    year and %HESITATION after that we ended up going to another evolution because
    we were in a report so we had to %HESITATION get all the how the %HESITATION hospital
