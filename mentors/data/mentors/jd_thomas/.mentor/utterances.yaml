    slow down. Um, let's go with first by being at home. Home port? Well, being important.
    So you're on a ship and you're important. One way to decompress would be on the
    right home and a right to work. Used that quiet time to gather your thoughts,
    to focus your thoughts, to shift gears from being full throttle at work, to going
    home to re prioritizing things by being with your family. So keep this in mind.
    Never take your work home, Leave work at work. And so when you walk outside of
    that, uh, offer the quarterdeck, take your hard hat off, take cover off figuratively
    and leave it at work. So you go home, Go be with your family on that ride home.
    Decompress. Get those thoughts out. Think about things that you that don't involve
    work. And then when you get home, focus on your family while you're deployed,
    say, on the ship for a time period, you decompress by working out by doing and
    being actively engaged in certain hobbies that you might you might be involved
    in. I think about things like maybe playing video games, reading magazines, reading
    a book. There's, ah, brief period before you say you're about to go hit the rack
    for the night. Take about 20 minutes. Thio. You know, pray, read a book, watch
    a movie, watch video, watch something to help decompress prior to going to sleep.

  transcript: for me Flight school, it it could be looked at as a touch of situation.
    But for me, it's, Ah, a learning experience. Flight school didn't work out for
    me. For a multitude of reasons. I'm a very spiritual person. So when you when
    you attend a strenuous training environment such as flight school, you have to
    be 110% focused on achieving that goal. Um, I wasn't able to do that. So down
    there I was focused on a multitude of different things. That flight school kind
    of took a back seat. And by the time that it did take a front row seat, it was
    too late. I was unable to, uh, recover, and fortunately, I was able to regroup
    and move on to something else. Um, I think as in general as servicemen, you know,
    sailors and military, uh, people. I guess you could say we all have this this
    inner thoughts about this inner thought or this interview of ourselves as if we
    can accomplish any and everything but the reality, you know, we fail. Sometimes,
    Sometimes things just don't work out, and you have to develop that that outlook
    that sometimes things just don't go your way, and sometimes you fail. But the
    key here is when you fail, can you move on with a better outlook on what happened?
    You always have to look at a situation as a learning experience as some some look
    at something some in some way, shape or form as how do I improve off of this situation?
    And that's what I had to do. And that's what you'll be asked to do when whatever
    situation you're in doesn't go as planned, it's temporary and that you can move
    on and be, you know, be a better person at whatever it may be. You just hit a
    bump in the road and you can move forward.

    It depends on what needs to take place out of the leader in that role. And also
    it depends on your experience and your knowledge of the situation, as well as
    the leaders of the senior petty officers, knowledge and experience in that situation.
    To bridge that gap and to move forward, you have to communicate early and often,
    and between yourself and that senior petty officer to kind of develop a understanding
    off of how he or she operates in a situation how you operate in a situation. It
    becomes like a marriage relationship between YouTube. Kind of like, you know,

    by my not being there. So you have to be around the sailors. You have to be around
    the personnel. You have to be there when they're going through rough times. You
    have to be there during the best times. Change that culture. They're gonna look
    at you as an example of what to do and what not to do in situations. Uhm as time
    goes on and as you progress in your your tours you'll start to notice that sailors
    will watch every everything that you do and what you say. And eventually they'll
    come to you and ask you for advice, sir. How do I do this? Sir, if you were in
    this situation, what would you do? And that's how you change culture. It takes
    time, but you leave by example and you stay present You You will eventually move
    that culture on being a more positive and productive environment.

  transcript: all right. So for person entering this field, I'll give you three priorities.
    The first and these are from 1 to 3. It may sound counterintuitive or kind of
    backwards, but you hear me out, the first priority will be self care. You always
    have to take care of yourself so physically, Mentally, emotionally, spiritually,
    financially. All five of those things are you should take those into account.
    Um when in terms of these powers, number two will be your family and friends,
    Your family and friends were allowing you for support. So be there for them as
    best you can. With the time that you have. Don't neglect him. Don't push them
    away. If you have issues with them or problems amongst each other, do your best
    to work out those conflicts and move forward. Your time on here on land with them
    is limited. So you always have to be a sea Ships will be at sea. Ships will operate
    so your time is limited. So spend what time you have with your family and friends
    and you know, joyous occasions. Number three in terms of Navy number three is
    navy. The Navy is 1/3 priority in my book simply because you can't take care of
    the Navy if you don't first take care of yourself and to take care of your family.
    If you don't take care of number, want numbers one and two. Your focus will not
    be on the Navy's mission, so prioritize those three. I'll fry Tito. I prioritize
    those three like that. Um, yeah.

    not relate to your peers and to your family and to your sailors. So you may be
    on some very secret squirrel mission or whatever it may be wherever it may be,

    me to, uh, um, like, operate throughout training or conduct myself throughout
    training. But it's a part of the job being in this career path. You spend days,
    weeks, maybe even months without seeing you're seeing or being able to converse
    with your family and friends. So as time goes on, you learn to manage and you
    learn to deal with it.

    in a situation, describe how they reacted on the things that the lessons they
    learned from being in certain situations. That's always a favorite of mine. There
    are tons of books and magazines and articles on leadership being in different
    situations. Look, look in the past, uh, there's a tons of situations off leaders
    and people throughout history who have gone through Ah, you know, different ordeals
    and experiences. Thio, you know, be successful as leaders. I took a class here
    at the Naval Postgraduate School my first quarter, and it discussed the, um, um,
    a disaster down on one of light headed towards like the Antarctica, an Arctic
    and about a group of sailors who were stuck down there for almost a year and 1/2

    to be up early and make around. So I would get up early, get ready, you know,

    and you want you making rounds. Walk your spaces. Make sure that your sailor see
    you out there early in the morning. And I often head up to the quarterdeck to
    see if there are any issues of within my personnel or something that I need to
    be notified off after that, you know, grab a quick breakfast and just go see a
    division walk around before quarters, meet them at quarters, you know, just kind

    \ that leads all the way to the bottom of the ship from the folks. So the idea\
    \ was to have a crane load the part onto the folks and lower it down for us. Easy\
    \ day. Well, wow. The crane was like bringing the part on board the shaft on the\

    And I really do feel this way that I'm just like you. I'm just like anyone else
    who I'm serving with. It's just I had a different opportunity. Someone told me
    about a program that this person didn't know about. Someone gave me opportunity
    tohave this chance to, you know, serve, serve our country that someone else didn't
    know about. So I think that's the big thing. Is that your sole special and that

  transcript: over my career. My word. They changed based on the demands of the command
    and on the the the commanding officer. So that's typically how your work they
    will change. So how you operate and approach your work day prior to deployment
    will be totally different than how you operate and approach the workday after
    a deployment. And the same can be said for dealing with inspections prior to inspection,
    say an insert. You can expect that your command will have six, maybe even seven
    day work weeks. But you pass that inspection on that insert, and you can expect
    that your work there will be totally different.

  transcript: so I would say that my career is kind of unique over the past eight
    years, I think I've moved maybe four or five times, and that's I think that's
    a unique situation. Prior to being commissioned Officer, I was enlisted as a undesignated
    airman for two years in Jacksonville. After earning my Camilo after applying O.
    C. S, I was given opportunity to earn my commission, which meant I had to move
    to Rhode Island. I was a earned my commission as a naval flight officer, so I
    left Rhode Island and went to Pensacola. I was down in Pensacola for about eight
    months in which I was tried it from flight school for a number of issues. I left
    went to San Diego for training in San Diego six months. So after their being in
    San Diego for six months of me and redesignated as a swot, I left for Japan for
    20 months. So I was in Japan 20 months, and then my tour ended, and then I ended
    up back in Jacksonville as a surface warfare office on a desk downstairs, and
    I was there for two years after Ben and Jacksonville for two years. I left, and
    now I'm here in California. So the rolls were a lot different. The demands were
    a lot different. But if you approach it your day almost you approach the day almost
    the same. It depends on the demands that are set upon the command and what the
    commanding officer expects out of his staff and his ship. So a lot of times, the
    commanding officer kind of dictates how ah, persons or his sailors days go his
    or her sailors Day goes.

    routine rounds with the team, so I would come in, you know, in the morning, right
    before lunch after lunch sometime in the evening and be present during special
    evolution's. If you know your your team has, say, evolution to training evolution,
    you might want to be around for it. Be around for the meetings, be around. Just
    be there. Be be around. It adds your input when it's needed. Sometimes you'll
    have to play. What I call would be the sword and the shield. Well, they might
    need someone to speak up for them to a senior, And you might be there might be
    that guy that take the sword and go out and do what you need to do and speak for
    them. But at the same time, if something happens, that's, um, like, not so good
    for your team as, say, a training evolution didn't go is playing. You need to
    be there to defend them, but how would you defend him if you're not there?

    You have to learn and, you know, just kind of gain that experience by doing it.
    You won't be successful in every matter, but what you can do is communicate. You
    can sit down with the sailor and say, Hey, you know I'm trying. Thio established
    this kind of culture. I'm trying to do X, Y and Z and respond to feedback. That's
    the big thing. Communicate and respond to Phoebe. So if you see something's not

    could happen if you go talk to someone, really nothing. So communicate. Sit down
    and talk with. That's how you that's how you move forward. That's how you deal
    with a wide multitude of people. You communicate, you listen. You observe, watch
    how they respond to you. When you say certain things, watch how they respond with
    certain other things happen for example, I knew certain sailors didn't, you know,
    respond well to me screaming and yelling or, you know, just being very playful
    or something. So you wouldn't be that way with that sailor. You know what I mean?
    You just have to respond accordingly. So but always, uh, observe and listen more

  transcript: counseling skills for a leader, I would definitely say, and I keep saying
    this one over and over his ability to empathize. If you have to counsel a sailor,
    the first question you should ask yourself is, How would I want someone to approach
    me in the same situation if I were in that sense? And how you respond in your
    mind is nine times out of 10 how you should respond to that sailor? So if you
    don't respond well to someone yelling and screaming at you, why would you yell
    and scream at a sale? If you don't respond well to someone cursing at you, why
    would you curse satisfied in a council? The situation? Um, my thing was, in terms
    of Council of Sailors is a a quote man to man or man to woman sit down personal
    closed door conversation where we discussed what happened, why it happened and
    the reasoning behind their behavior and how we fixed that going forward and what
    I have to do in terms of being a leader going forward and what my expectations

    and understand how to approach in interact with some of the younger service. And
    that's understandable. But you as a a subordinate to, say a senior, you have to
    be able to understand that things aren't perfect. Take your ego out of it and
    find out what makes the boss t what makes them happy and what makes them happy.
    We'll make you happy because they're happy. So with that relationship, just do
    your best to keep it professional and respectful. If you keep it professional,
    you won't have to worry about anything going south. So nine times out of 10 don't
    respond with how you really feel. Just keep it professional and keep it respectful,

    better when they feel as if they own something. And that simple notion will encourage
    someone to be accountable for their equipment before a program. So throughout
    your team to develop or encourage accountability would be to give a sailor program
    and sit down and communicate with them your expectations and your standards and
    encourage them to make this program the best or, you know, to pass an expectation,
    you know, whatever it may be. But that sense of ownership encourages accountability
    alone. But you just have to be the leader, too. Find that that that sailor, that
    you can apply to that program Thio, you know, move forward. So ownership encourages

    And three, It's kind of tough to explain, but there is there in the military you
    you're always under like the watchful eye of something that I think that's the
    big thing. It's like you're you're always under the microscope when you're in
    the military. So everything that you say you do, you're being like scrutinized
    for you, man. Watch for, say, for example, incident happens out in town, and I'm
    in my uniform the difference between me being in that incident as a civilian between
    and now, you know, in my uniform it's looked at as, Hey, Naval Officer did X,
    y and Z. But if I was as a civilian, it'll just be J d. The this. You know, you
    represent a larger a group of people, a larger organization, I think that plays
    ah big part into a person's like a day to day operations as faras the differences,
    but also you get there. You know, there's like a a different, um, sense of. I
    guess you could say freedom as a civilian as opposed to being in the military.
    Because every day I think I like, Hey, I'll be I don't I won't be I won't be anywhere

  transcript: right. Um, the differences between us and the other branches are for
    one. I think our culture, um, a big day for me, especially when I joined, was
    the fact that if you join the Navy nine times out of 10 you'll be around some
    form of water and, uh, unlike being an air force of the Army or the Marines, I
    didn't want to be anywhere near the desert or anywhere near like a bunch of just
    like nature. I didn't want to sleep after sleep out in the field. I rather sleep
    in a little cot on the ship at the bottom of the ship, as opposed to sleeping
    out in the desert. So I would say those are like two of the big things is just
    the locations that you're operating in and the climate and environment operating
    in, and just the culture of being a sailor. Um, being on their side, you can kind
    of notice like a definitely a rah rah, you know, mentality out of the say, the
    Marines and the Army And the Air Force is more like laid back, like we're kind

    would have to say returning from a deployment say on boy like any any ship after
    a long period out at sea. Uh, so the general excitement among the crew and you
    know each other's It just kind of raises morale because, you know, you're going
    home. You know, everyone's kind of walking on like cloud now, like the last couple
    of days, and it's almost like a kid going to Disney World for the first time the
    night before. It's like that kid and sleep is just so excited to read to go home.
    You know, you're just ready to see your family and friends. And that culture just
    kind of hits its peak the day off when everyone is putting on their dress whites

    and, you know, you finally hear the the man the rails called on the one emcee,
    and that's how you know it's like you're going home. And I think that that culture
    kind of hits it hits its peak at that time toe where you're putting import and
    you and all your 300 of your closest friends are going home for the first time
    in seven or eight months on. And I think that just kind of, you know, that that
    just sums up like Navy culture, right?

  transcript: and so a number of ways that you can affect morale is for one, you're
    personally. It's about being positive, and I would like to think that a positive
    attitude is contagious. So the more you're smiling, the more that you're being
    positive about things. The more others will be positive about things on board.
    Like certain ships. You are every ship that I've been on. I had the privilege
    of being on. There are definitely a number of activities that you can engage in
    which you start with each other to, you know, help building around. There's bingo
    night. There's a video game night. There's our I hop night where you know the
    C S is get around and they cook. I hot pancakes for an omelets for dinner. You
    know that ice cream night? There's pizza and Chicken wing night, but also you
    have certain activities that sometimes that the captain will push, which are like
    they'll allow beards so you pay the into the MW are fun, say, three bucks or so,
    and you can grow your beard out. Do you? You know, you come back in port, so you
    know, that's like a big morale booster believe it or not, is it zip? It may seem
    very small, but something like that will build morale very quickly if I don't
    have to get up and save everyone and I could walk around with beer. But things
    like that, um, those air about, you know, just about the limits that a person
    can do or someone can do to affect morale when you have obligations to meet outside
    of that, you know, putting import as often as you are allowed to and getting off
    the ship. Just been able to decompress and are going tours and see things. And,
    uh, those are about the best that you can do to build around.

    interrupt of how much you speak or you attempt to speak. I always say that people
    there are two types of people. People who listen to respond and people who listen
    to understand. If you know that you're a person that listens to respond, practice
    not responding. Practice. Listening, engaging, active listening. Which would be
    say, if you're speaking to me, maybe not, maybe respond. Ask a question while
    they're speaking, and as time goes on, you'll just develop those habits of not
    speaking while someone else's. You know why you're supposed to be listening? Try
    to repeat things in your mind that that person is saying, and those things are

    and that is to take advantage of every training opportunity that that you're given.

    striving for the same qualifications and contrary to properly believe this is
    not a competition work together. There's a famous saying. Teamwork makes the dream
    work for you to study together, train together, work together. It will allow you
    to be Maur of a competent watch stander instead of always thinking and looking
    over your shoulder, worrying about what this person may have, what that person
    may have, so work together and use your time wisely.

  transcript: um, I have faced the numerous challenges throughout my career. Um, the
    first challenge was to balance family and home life with your new career. That's
    a challenging in itself. The Navy is very demanding, and I like to laugh and joke,
    you know, with my girlfriend and say, You know, you're the mistress going into
    this situation and the Navy's my wife So you know, you have to get in where you
    fit in, but that's somewhat that some way that's true. Eso you as the service
    member, you have to find that work life balance. On the second challenge. I've
    gone through some challenges throughout. You know, some of my training. I was
    a flight school to try, so I went to I was commissioned as a Naval flight officer
    student initially, so that was a probably the biggest challenge that I faced throughout
    my career. One word at one piece of advice, I could say to anyone going through
    Ah, similar challenge would be to look at every opportunity as ah ah, learning
    lesson and think of the positives, always having a positive attitude and always
    having a can do attitude, no matter what. So those were probably two biggest challenges
    off a so far

  transcript: the most challenging part about my job would happen. It would probably
    be the interacting and working with the different personalities. Different backgrounds
    and the different cultures may sound funny at first, but when you were, you've
    got 3 403 to 400 people on on this 510 foot, you know, ship for months on end.
    It's kind of difficult to continue those working relationships when you live,
    eat and sleep with each other as in sleep next to each other.

    to you because you're a new addition to the command. And that person will be,
    you know, similar in rain age. Or, you know, something similar to what you have
    and what you are. Excuse me. So reach out to that sponsor. If you haven't gotten
    a sponsor, reach out to the command 99% of time. Each command has a website, uh,
    thio get in touch with and that command typically probably four or five months
    or maybe even further out. Maybe about a year before you're due to arrive, they'll
    send out a welcome aboard package, which includes names, sponsor name, phone numbers,
    command information, email addresses and things of that nature. It will also allow
    you to get in touch with, say, the command on Budge Mint, which is typically a
    navy, a spouse of someone in the command who's in charge of helping your family
    get acclimated to the new area and you'll reach out through your sponsor. And
    through that welcome aboard package, you'll be able to find schools, living areas,
    housing opportunities, Religious service is just about any and everything that
    you may need that those personnel will be able to help you out. Another resource

  transcript: um, one situation comes to mind when I think about unethical decision.
    I had to make that stem from U. S s far ship where there was a, um, a young enlisted,
    you know, sailor who had come to me one day and told me about a situation. She
    was being approached by one of the one of my fellow duty officers. And hey was
    making advances on and, uh, she expressed the ah, you know, her her feelings,
    that she didn't want the advances and that she didn't want him to get in trouble
    and that he hadn't touched or anything. He was just pushing up on her and I had
    done it a few times, and she wanted to bring it to someone's attention. But he
    didn't want you. She didn't want to get him in trouble. So I told her I talked
    to him and I wanted her to keep me in the loop. If something were to happen because,
    you know, I would take it up the chain of command. So, um, I don't calling him
    on the ship phone one day and asked him to come talk to me and s o he proceeded
    to do so. And you know, I told him, you know what I had been told and that he
    shouldn't do, you know, you know, proceed any further, you know, to stop it here.
    And ah, he kind agreed to it and known associate. Kind of agreed to it s o. I
    informed my immediate supervisor. And, you know, we just kind of moved on from
    there. Well, he proceeded. Thio continued advances and, you know, I ended up taking
    it up the chain of command and sometime later, but the time between I me initially
    knowing about it and between me take it up to command had been about two months,
    So I ended up getting in a little trouble behind it and looking back of I don't
    know if I would handle it any differently because I felt like I was doing the
    right thing by handled it the situation at the lowest level. Ah. Then on the other
    hand, I would say that it was a situation where I should have just taken it up
    the chain of command immediately, you know, So it's kind of like a battle with
    that, even today

    Um, if you have the means to by home, I think you should do so. But that's also
    taking into consideration your personal finances as well as the situation within
    the housing market. Um, I purchased my first house about three years ago. Almost.
    I was, what, 29. So about my thing was, I didn't have the money saved up until
    I was 29 to purchase the house, but also took him to consideration. You know,
    my follow on duty stations. Would I be stationed back in Jacksonville? Will I
    be chances of me being stationed in San Diego or no phone are greater than Jacksonville.
    And you don't plan on going back to Jacksonville? Why buy a house in Jackson s
    O? These are things that you have to take into consideration when you decide to
    buy a house or when you decide to rent. Um, I've had this conversation with a
    few of my buddies who are more senior and are on the back end of their career.
    And some of have never own houses. And some are in the market to purchase houses
    simply because it's there finishing their career. And they, their families are
    there looking to settle down in one place and stay in one place. So it kind of
    depends on what you want to do as a person. Do you want to have investment rental
    properties, or do you want to rent until you decide to retire? It's solely up
    to you. But, uh, hi person would use the resources that are available to me when

    some of my circumstances are a little different, but I've moved about every two
    years, and you can somewhat of expect the same. Your first to devote tours are
    about two years each. And unless you fleet up, you have probably spend your first
    tour in one place, and you're second to another place. After your second tour,
    you'll go to shore duty chases. Are you want to spend that somewhere else, Or
    you will go to earn, say, ah, master's degree or something. So that means you
    move again after you finish your duty. You could be expected to go to department

  transcript: the short answer to that is yes. Um, longer answer is it depends on
    on the situation. Of course, ships are meant to be at sea, and they move a lot.
    So depending on the requirements of the command and demands for the missions that
    they're they're set to meet, you may be at what's called River City, which the
    CEO shuts down all outside communication outside of, uh, mission necessary calms.
    So your e mails, your Facebooks, all that kind of stuff wouldn't work. Even the
    phones are shut down, but typically, why you're out to sea and your steam. You
    have access to email, you may be allowed to get on Facebook, and that's kind of
    actual seals discretion. And you have phone calls.

  transcript: again. Short answer is yes. The longer answer is it Opinions. Um, I
    want to say there's, ah rule in someone in one of the instructions that basically
    says that you're a lot. Your CEO is allowed to give you one beer every 44 days
    at sea, but you can almost guarantee that you will not be at sea for 44 days unless
    you absolutely have to. So, most of all, boys and most cares will pull in, um,
    under that 44 4 day limit while you're out steam and definitely not you won't
    be allowed alcohol. But once your import, it depends on the your CEO's discretion.
    Chances are you'll be allowed to drink alcohol in the event that no one on the
    ship or let's say, within a strike group if you're operating within the strike
    group has had in like, alcohol related incidents. So when you do get to drink,
    just be on your best behavior and make it watch out for your buddies and to make
    sure that they're got not getting in any trouble or alcohol related incidents,
    which will calls you no more problems and people not being able allowed to drink

  transcript: All right, so two things here worry is the wrong word. You should never
    worry about retirement too. You should always think about retirement. So as soon
    as you, uh, basically, as soon as you raise your right hand, you should be focused
    on retirement. You should live your career to retire. So the idea for me is to
    retire. Excuse me is to retire as an 06 at 25 years. That would give me that would
    put me out of certain income range and a certain pension range. Also, the Navy
    has done an awesome job of helping sailors plan for retirement through the first
    savings playing the TSP. So out of your 1st 4 years, say, within the military
    or a typical enlistment for Ah, listen, serviceman, you'll be on like a probationary
    pier where you're, uh, basically, you're given, I think, 5%. After that first
    year of being in the military, the neighborhood match 5% to your 5% and you can
    put anywhere up to nothing each year or your entire paycheck or your special pays
    or your bonuses into this TSP A good rule of thumb for investing into your retirement
    is 10%. So I would recommend you put in about 10% into your retirement through
    the TSP monthly and for the start of your career, a CZ you gain income and gain
    rank and obtained bonuses. I would say, you know, find that financial freedom
    to balance that you're spending habits and but paying by paint. But paying yourself
    first through your investments in your TSP. So you should never worry about retirement
    but should always have it on your mind. So invested in your retirement by using
    utilizing the TSP and other investments. Such a mutual funds. Rafael Reyes Traditional
    IRAs, um, certificates of deposits, things that of that nature. So never worry
    about retirement, but think about it always.

  transcript: So this one is a tough question to deal with emotionally from it from
    an emotional standpoint. But here you have to think about you know, things logically,
    like you're not all. You may not always be there for your family. You were in
    your war fighter and, you know, war, state place and things do happen. Also, training
    accidents do happen, and not as frequently as they used to. But, you know, things
    happen where sometimes sailors don't come home. So you have to play for for the
    worst, you have to always hope for the best, but plan for the worst, and that
    being you not come home. So, um, another tidbit for me is to invest in additional
    life insurance early, early you are, Which kind of correlates to you being in
    better shape. The younger you are, the lower that you'll pay monthly for additional
    life insurance. So, of course, the, uh, what's provided for us is I think it's
    almost 30 bucks. Monthly is the SDO lie, which gives us $400,000 or gives your
    family $400,000 of life insurance and event. Something happens to you while you're
    out service But banks like Navy, Federal and USA have life insurance, additional
    life insurance policies, which are term life insurance policy and whole life insurance
    policies. Where in the event something happens to you while you're active duty,
    you can receive up to an additional. Um, I guess, you know, somewhere along the
    lines of, like, 1/2 a $1,000,000 for, uh, for your family and event, something
    happens for you to you, Um, with these policies, especially on the USA, because
    I have two additional with us A a term in the whole life. Uh, what happens is
    I pay them monthly premium for both life insurance policies. And in the event,
    something happens to me. My beneficiaries will receive, you know, lump sums of
    money in addition to the Stu alive. Now, you might ask the question. What happens
    if I retirement? We're not retired. Do I lose the SD alive? Well, yes, you do.
    But when you retire with your own life insurance policies, especially through
    a U. S. A. That money, the money's that you have through this year, lie will roll
    over and to some of these policies that you get through your say so you, don't
    you lose that $400,000? So that's something. Another thing for you to think about
    as a say, a husband or father.

    an investment property. It comes with certain stipulations, but I think it's Ah,
    definitely an avenue you should venture into or think about when I decided to
    buy a home. Also, a lot of the credit card companies allow you to obtain credit
    cards with extensive fees. That's if you are on a if you are responsible enough
    to handle that responsibility of owning a credit card, which I assume you are

    I'm not advocating for anyone cos just one that I used. American Express has a
    number of credit cards with um, they allow a lot of perks. For example, gold status
    for these hotel chains of rental car changes. You get like an upgraded member
    status for just being just owning the car and normally as ah, save typical consumer,
    you pay about 500 to 600 bucks a year in credit card fees for just having a car.
    But through the Civil Service Civil Servicemember Relief Act or something, you're
    allowed to bypass those fees and obtain that car. And though these cars give you
    a lot of perks and a lot of benefits, so those are just too, that I I used to

    these credit cards and obtained all the points behind them so you can use the

    for an exercise or something and you have a government travel car, you could spend
    those moneys through using that government travel car in a program called DTs.
    Which of the defense travel system if I'm not mistaken, so you're going there
