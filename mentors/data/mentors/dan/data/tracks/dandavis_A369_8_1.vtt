00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.900
many people could remember when they first got some impression of what

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.940
 it was like to be in the military but I literally was more than to

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.990
 the military %HESITATION my father a game to commission in the US navy

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.030
 during World War two %HESITATION while %HESITATION I was still with

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.080
 my mother because she was pregnant with me and hadn't been delivered

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.120
 yet %HESITATION so my father got extension to his reporting or orders

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.170
 to stay around and next to a couple of weeks of for my arrival

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.210
 and virtually I write four weeks later so he had gone off to his duty

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.260
 in buffalo New York where as a US navy supply officer he was buying

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.300
 PT boat engines %HESITATION from a company in the end up also %HESITATION

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.350
 my mother and I'd like to %HESITATION brothers all joined him

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.400
 later on %HESITATION that summer instant the Russian war with him

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.440
 there in buffalo I have no memory of buffalo %HESITATION but as soon

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.490
 as I was old enough to have knowledge of what was going on I was aware

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.530
 that my father was still in the navy reserve and would periodically

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.580
 go off for duty and on occasion he would fly with us and take us

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.620
 to where he was doing his duty and we would kind of kill time around

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.670
 the navy reserve center while he was doing his duty so I had some

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.710
 exposure the military from the get go and I've always been an avid

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.760
 reader of military history so I've pretty much been steeped in the military

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.800
 from %HESITATION literally day one all the way through to today
