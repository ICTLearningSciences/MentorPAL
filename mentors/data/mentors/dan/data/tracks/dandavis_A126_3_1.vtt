00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.080
When I was in language school in Washington DC, I was taking Vietnamese

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.310
 and the Vietnamese all spoke French as a second language and they

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.540
 preferred French because French is a much richer and and intellectual

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.770
 language than Vietnamese. Vietnamese is an agricultural language and

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.000
 doesn't have a lot of subtlety to it, so they all spoke French. So

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.230
 they hired a young woman who had just gotten a degree in French from

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.470
 the university of Maryland to speak French to the Vietnamese and

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.700
 she was almost six feet tall, and as I was six six my marine corps "oh

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.930
 that one's yours, Davis". So we corresponded, everybody else got

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.160
 dear John letters in Vietnam, all I got was chocolate chip cookies and

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.390
 one bottle of wine she smuggled through the mail to me, that worked

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.620
 out pretty well. So when I got out I married her and this last August

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.850
 we've been married forty six years.
