00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.940
the study preview regular amount when I was in college but some people

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.030
 had to study a lot more than I studied in some people study a lot less

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.120
 than I study it depends on the courses you're taking it depends

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.210
 on intellectual capabilities you have in the background you have but

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.300
 it's probably twice as much studying in colleges who used to doing

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.400
 the most high schools but that varies by high school what I know their

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.490
 high schools we can get to the entire high school program and get

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.580
 pretty good grades by doing nothing other than showing up in class

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.670
 and then there are other high schools are very very challenging their

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.760
 almost collegiate like yeah and the amount of study you have to do

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.850
 to get a decent grade
