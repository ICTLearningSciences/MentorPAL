00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.540
I grew up in the nuclear family of a father who was a lawyer, a mother

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.230
 who ran the beauty school, and three brothers. My eldest brother was

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.930
 twelve and a half years older than I was, and recently passed away.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.620
 He was a veterinarian and worked for large drug companies most of

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.310
 his life. I had a brother just took two and a half years older than

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.000
 I was, he has an MBA from the university of Chicago and worked at a

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.700
 drug company in Illinois - Abbott laboratories - doing management for

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.390
 his entire career. And then I have a younger brother who is five and

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.080
 a half years younger than I am, who went out to the ROTC program

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.770
 at Duke University and was a naval sub officer for twelve and a half

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.470
 years until his wife told him "if you go to sea one more time I won't

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.160
 be here when you come back", so he quit after twelve and a half years

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.850
 as Lieutenant Commander
