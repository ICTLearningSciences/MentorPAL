00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.800
whether you are a leader in the military or leader in civilian life most

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.750
 important decision you have this how are my best going to use my

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.700
 where they best fit how can I best achieve my goals with the people

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.650
 that have been given to sometimes is difficult their egos involved your

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.600
 own ego egos of others sometimes is difficult because our sacrifices

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.550
 ball in the military admiral Arly Burke said there is no greater

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.500
 stress than the stress the commander in combat and that's got to be

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.450
 true I was never faced with having to tell a person you're going to

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.400
 have to die to save the rest of us you're gonna have to die to make

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.350
 sure this mission goes but there are times in the military when every

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.300
 leader has to say we've got to go up that hill even though a lot

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.250
 of the screen is kill so I think those are the kind of critical decisions

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.200
 you have I was never faced with a life and death decision that

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.150
 was that close to me but one of things about the military's every

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.100
 decision you make when I sit down to do a translation if I don't do

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.050
 it right somebody's going to die if I do it right somebody else made

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.000
 so there's there's kind of a lot of weight on you and you have to rely

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.950
 on the people around you to say yeah I do the best you can make

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.900
 the best decision you can and press forward number since at Saint and

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.850
 none of us is immune to the pressure that we face
