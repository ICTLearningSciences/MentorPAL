 career in civilian life or a career in the military though there will

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.850
 be a lot of pressure on you to get a degree maybe just an associate's

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 degree when you get out of high school maybe pick up your associate's

 on your own you can learn how to program on your program I we knew

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.850
 that I never had a course in computer science so those are things you

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.850
 do on your own but the degree indicates well more than that it indicates

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.850
