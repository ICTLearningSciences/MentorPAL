00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.890
one of the absolute best things about the military life and this is been

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.930
 true for the five thousand years of of recorded history is the camaraderie

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.970
 between people who have to fight in any kind of context %HESITATION

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.020
 the bunnies you get in the military the best buddies you'll

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.060
 ever have and all you have to do is go to a local newspaper look at

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.100
 reunions with guys getting together fifty years after they serve together

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.140
 in the military and while you're in the military that leads

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.180
 to a lot of socializing so in almost every setting with which I have

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.230
 been familiar %HESITATION there were things called clubs they were

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.270
 listed clubs or senior NCO clubs chief petty officer clubs commission

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.310
 officer clubs and all those clubs on either on bass and that's where

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.350
 you went right after you got off duty every day they have a couple

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.390
 beers with your friends and colleagues to discuss the problems of

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.430
 the day discuss the issues you had with very people in the unit and

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.470
 plan for the future and it was kind of a a nice informal way to get

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.520
 the sorts of things ironed out and on weekends are always parties there

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.560
 were parties at night there were parties on the beach I can still

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.600
 remember the wonderful wonderful times I had when I was in Pensacola

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.640
 well this is a list of man as an officer going out to this beautiful

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.680
 white sand beaches and bearing a %HESITATION trashcan full of ice

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.730
 and beer the say in and just spending the day having a good time drinking

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.770
 beer and talking about very these issues and just enjoying being

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.810
 together with your buddies %HESITATION so those socializing was

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.850
 the best in the world when we were in the service
