00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.770
for the last five thousand years of recorded history %HESITATION virtually

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.690
 everyone at some time or another in their lives been called upon

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.610
 to defend their country their own their state %HESITATION their city

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.530
 whatever group they belong to and those people always bonded together

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.450
 in a way that is allowed them to get through these onerous times

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.370
 when people are injured or even killed %HESITATION in so virtually

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.290
 everyone has had some exposure to being required or being called to

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.210
 do time in the military I think we we are better equip these days to

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.130
 handle virtually everyone in the military that we were back in the

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.050
 days of the Greek city states for instance where if you were called

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.970
 to a war you got your shield your spear and you stood in line today

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.890
 there are very few people who are engaged in the actual task of fighting

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.810
 %HESITATION there's so much support work so much planning so much

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.730
 meat and so much training going on the only small number of people

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.650
 actually %HESITATION are at the pointy end of the spear as they say

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.570
 so there is really a place for virtually everyone in the military

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.490
 so they take a contrary in view on that there is a place for everybody

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.410
 even artist can be a photographer even a great writer can be in

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.330
 military journalists %HESITATION so there's a place even for people

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.250
 you don't think I was having particular military skills a but there

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.170
 is one group of people who probably shouldn't be in the military and

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.090
 there are those who are so anti social in so resistant to any kind

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.010
 of %HESITATION group those or just one that they just can't get along

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.930
 in the military and those people probably gonna have trouble with

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.850
 society but they certainly don't belong in the military
