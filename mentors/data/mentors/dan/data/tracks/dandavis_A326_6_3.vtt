00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.540
you probably be surprised to find out that when I was in the navy in one

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.230
 of his before that when I was in the marine corps a lot of young

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.910
 people would come to me and say you know when I get other core we get

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.600
 on the navy I'm never going to wear uniform again I'm never gonna

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.290
 let anybody tell me what I have to do again and that was older than

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.970
 most of them and I thought Boyer they ever wrong because to some degree

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.660
 every large organization is to some degree they're the same in that

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.350
 they do have rules that you have to follow they do have leadership

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.040
 hierarchies we're going to be told what to do if you want to join

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.730
 the revolution and the overthrow of the world what you gonna find is

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.410
 yes the revolutionaries have a higher key to every revolutionary cell

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.100
 has a leader people who report to him and people who hear reports

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.790
 so you know they're all the same and they usually have the uniform

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.470
 they not be exactly the same like the military but if I were to wear

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.160
 three piece suit and short film local rap concert I wouldn't be in

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.850
 uniform and people would ostracize me for the whale is stressed yeah

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.540
 if I wore the kind of comes to mind where for break dancing on the

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.230
 street and show up at a board meeting at IBM that I should have ostracize

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.910
 me again you dress like the other people dress to make your group

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.600
 coherent and that's what it's been all through history so I think

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.290
 when you go from the military to college you gonna find a higher

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.970
 key you're gonna find rules you know find appropriate ways to communicate

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.660
 in dress and you're gonna find the process it you have to go through

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.350
 if you're going to advance the biggest difference probably has

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.040
 that reinforcement is much more rapidly in the military if you wear

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.730
 the wrong uniform in the military you can be put in the brig for being

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.410
 out of uniform so they let you know right away don't do that cries

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.100
 in campus if if you don't behave the way you're supposed to behave

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.790
 in campus they may tolerate you for a long time before you're expelled

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.470
 from college so to some degree college life breeds a level of

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.160
 responsibility over time it you don't get when you have so much scrutiny

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.850
 and immediate reaction in the military
