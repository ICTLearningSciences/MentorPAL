educators always tell you what I was hearing you repeat that your grade

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.520
 is not the important thing learning what they're trying to teach you

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.850
 is important learning how old put their teaching you will fit into

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.180
 your life is court mastering the material is important learning yourself

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.520
 whether Michael that how do I need to behave to be able to do

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.850
 the right thing all those things are important the GPA will follow

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.180
 on its own but there are number of factors that will be decided by your

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.520
 GPA one for instance is if you want to go on to graduate work it's

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.850
 going to be impacted by Eugene another is if you're trying to get

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.180
 a job there are lot of people who before they will hire you or look

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.520
 at your grades and test and see whether you did well in school so all

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.850
 of us have some affect but I think you know of being obsessed with

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.180
 GPA is not productive focus on what you need to know what you need

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.520
 to learn and what you need to find out about yourself during the process
