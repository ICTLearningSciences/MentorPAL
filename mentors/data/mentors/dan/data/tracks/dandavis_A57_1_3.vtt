00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.550
One of the real benefit you get in the military is stability. Even during

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.250
 the depression, they were not throwing people out of the military

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.950
 as long as you perform well and get good marks from you seniors, you

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.650
 can stay in the military twenty thirty years and retire. There occasionally

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.350
 have been rifts like after World War two, more people want

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.050
 to stay in the service than they had spots for, so some people had

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.750
 to be excused from the service. And that was particularly true in the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.450
 officer ranks, enlistined people who had gotten elevated to officer

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.150
 ranks earlier in the war, when the war was over were hoping to stay

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.850
 as officers. But frequently they were told "no we're sorry we just

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.550
 don't have enough officer billets so you must revert" then most of

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.250
 those reversions were back to a senior enlisted rating. And then when

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.950
 it came time to retire, the person was allowed to retire at their

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.650
 rank that they had achieved in the reserve duty. And so that means

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.350
 if I were a captain and I got sent back to staff sergeant and then made

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.050
 my way up to master sergeant before I had time to retire, I probably

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.750
 would retire as a major because the captain normal would get promoted

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.450
 to major. And so they allow me to retire but, in general, employment

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.150
 once again you can stay as long as you want and they want you

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.850
 to stay as long as you can.
