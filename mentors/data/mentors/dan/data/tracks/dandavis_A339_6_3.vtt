00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.400
those distracting thing to me is inter personal turmoil now when people

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.950
 are not getting along when they're angry at each other with their

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.500
 job is not be performed correctly because you're too busy fighting about

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.050
 something some of that probably is because I am the third of four

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.600
 children and later born children are very high on trying to keep

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.150
 the family on an even keel they were at the biggest or the strongest

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.700
 of the best educated ever in their life growing up because their older

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.250
 siblings were so the thing they were trying to do is let's get for

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.800
 what you get along it's not cause trouble so you have to hear what

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.350
 I say in terms of who I am website came but basically speaking I feel

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.900
 like that kind of distraction can not only keep you from doing the

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.450
 work you're doing right now but kannst destroy the effectiveness

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.000
 of the group in the future so when you have that kind of inter personal

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.550
 problem I think there are number of ways you can fix and and we

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.100
 all know the least we learned input from a little child if you misbehave

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.650
 again you're not playing well with group then you need to be apart

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.200
 from the group while so sometimes if you have interpersonal problems

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.750
 in a group you have to Jones why don't you go on TV a to another

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.300
 post and and go do something else with another group people and then

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.850
 come back and go back to work with us so that's one way it's kind

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.400
 of ease the tension by breaking the law second thing is the best way

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.950
 to do is being an active listener good interpersonal tension get the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.500
 people aside and say what's bothering why does that bother you how

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.050
 does that bother you when does it not bother and ask those questions

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.600
 this takes a very strong ego on your part because if the person answers

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.150
 your the thing that's bothering me you've got to think okay talking

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.700
 to me about the best the marine corps has a wonderful policy

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.250
 for when you get out of the they assign a senior MC overcome talked

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.800
 no one thinks he's told is ask him what's wrong with the corps before

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.350
 he gets out and let him tell you what's wrong with the corps old gill

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.900
 the senior sergeants are all still burden they maybe do stuff I

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.450
 want to do and they're all drunk all time yeah just let the guy ran

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.000
 out because of the rain it's too you have get it out of the system who

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.550
 gets home so Maria said how was in the core and you say we had a

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.100
 great time we drank together we had fun together I enjoyed the work

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.650
 I did you know my technical Bob so sometimes it's good just let people

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.200
 talk it out and sometimes it's very good to get the warring parties

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.750
 together and say what we've got to work together so you guys got

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.300
 to figure out how can you get along and get over this whatever is causing

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.850
 the
