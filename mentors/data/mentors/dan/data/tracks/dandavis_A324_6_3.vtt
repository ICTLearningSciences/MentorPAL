00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.280
many young people are very concerned about what they'll have to give up

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.710
 if they go into specific field I don't think that's the right way

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.140
 to look at it it's true that if you go into some fields are gonna have

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.560
 to emphasize some courses more than other courses and your activities

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.990
 to be some ways in rather other ways but life is a process now

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.420
 and I've had several careers in my life in men in fact during a recent

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.850
 proposal to take over a hi performance computing center one of the

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.280
 questioners said who's this Davis guy looks like he said more careers

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.710
 them and other people do because who who I was a marine cryptologist

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.140
 and the needy commander I used to teach school I practiced law

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.560
 for a long time I do computer research immerses guy and that's fairly

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.990
 common these days people have a number here in careers so if you take

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.420
 a little might feel computer science let's say you're going to computer

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.850
 science going to university of southern California and get the

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.280
 engineering school in computer science you have to do a lot of Matthew

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.710
 Lovett computer science can do very much music United have much

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.140
 time left over history but after you've done computer science Adak

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.560
 aid you go back and get a masters in armor organ performance Bruce

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.990
 on the you you get a back and get a doctorate in education because you

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.420
 want to teach so you have a chance go back into a that you've got

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.850
 this remember that we living long enough now we have time for three

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.280
 or four careers full careers and what I mean by a full career if you

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.710
 look at people who used to die in the early forties their career was

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.140
 about twenty years and most of us now live to eighty so we've got

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.560
 three twenty year careers after we get out of college Missouri available

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.990
 to us and plenty of time to do the education and do their career

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.420
 so don't feel like you're giving up something just be realizing you

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.850
 just postponing a little
