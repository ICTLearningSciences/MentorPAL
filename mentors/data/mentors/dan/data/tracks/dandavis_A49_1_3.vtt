By and large your private time of the service is your own and you are

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.470
 not obligated to do any work on it, but like every other job that you

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.770
 have in civilian life even, there are a lot of things that you just

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.080
 can't get done for your work at work. It may be reading it may be

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.390
 studying it may be going over a presentation. You're going to do or

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.700
 something and the navy's like that too and the marine corps was as well.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.000
 So there are times and at night especially when you're doing training

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.310
 or at school where it may be your private time you may be off

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.620
 duty you may be at home but you have to pull out the books you have

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.930
 to pull out your studies and spent a little time on them. I would say

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.230
 probably ten percent of your private time is spent taking care of

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.540
 your navy and your marine corps duty, taking care of uniforms and the

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.850
 like.
