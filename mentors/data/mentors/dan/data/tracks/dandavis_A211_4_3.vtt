if you have a well developed career planned ahead of you your priorities

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.450
 probably being something but if you start out like I did with no

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.750
 idea who you were or what you want to do here's one to have a good time

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.050
 and enjoy people and do something you felt was worth while so through

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.350
 my life my priorities have always been I want to be with a good

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.650
 group of people are going to be accepted by them I want to get value

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.950
 what I do I want to be able to tell you what I did it on my own and

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.250
 as I've gotten older I think I've even increased my enthusiasm for

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.550
 those goals so I think my priorities have become strengthened as I've

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.850
 gotten older but they have not changed to any specific degree
