00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.450
I think one of the things we miss most in life is good mentors and the

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.050
 ability to accept mentor ship from someone else one of the best mentors

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.650
 I ever had was head senior navy officer to me anyway see when I

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.250
 became an instant he was a Lieutenant Commander and the first active

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.850
 duty I did with him after I got my commission we went to Pensacola

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.450
 and we had to proceed every day three gate to get on base and the gate

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.050
 was manned not by military personnel but by civilian security guards

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.650
 that's wasn't the way it was when I was in the service but was

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.250
 there and they did a very bad job they were slovenly they didn't seem

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.850
 to be paying attention to what was going on sometimes she had to get

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.450
 their attention to even check your ID Sir here on base I just thought

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.050
 they were done a terrible job so we got ready to leave they passed

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.650
 out he formed a bunch of us who'd been on active duty there and

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.250
 on the foreman said tell us what your experience here and if there's

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.850
 anything you think should be changed clothes no and I said to the senior

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.450
 officer who is my mentor I really get a lot of have about that

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.050
 from Kate they did a bad job out here and they need to know what somebody

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.650
 needs to fix that and he said stop do not do that he said if

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.250
 there was a problem in the main gate you should fix it yourself or you

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.850
 should have told somebody when you first got here about it but my

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.450
 advice would have been know that C. operational issue somebody from

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.050
 outside helmet was broken would not help and it would just make it

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.650
 worse and he said that slot that they give you on that form they're

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.250
 gonna have to write a fitness report for you when you leave here about

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.850
 what you accomplish that form is their input into the fitness report

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.450
 to go right holy cow that's important as how you get promoted this

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.050
 could finish so I sat down to write my fitness report and I wrote

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.650
 I came here to learn the most marvelous stuff I came and learn things

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:14.250
 that will do me the very well in the rest of my career I keep things

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.850
 I can reply immediately to my fictional duties as an officer bom

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.450
 bom bom and when I got my room fitness supportive my home unit some

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.050
 month later so guess what those exact words were my fitness for ensign

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.650
 Davis came here and learned some wonderful stuff Benson Davis can

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.250
 use his stuff in his professional and I thought I'd that was good

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.850
 advice
