00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.410
The question often comes in management circles, "how much do you tell

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.970
 the troops?", "how much do you tell your employees?", "how much is too

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.530
 much?" A lot of people have a problem with telling the people working

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.090
 for them too much because they say my power is I know things my

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.650
 people don't know therefore they will have to come to me to find out

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.210
 what's going on and I will be powerful. I've never felt that way.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.770
 I've always felt like you should flow everything you know down to the

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.330
 people. Let them sit through what they want and retain what they don't.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.890
 And you keep your ears open for anything falling back up. So you

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.450
 know what's going on. So I feel like I've always tried to get everybody

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.010
 understand what my goals are and try to understand what my bosses

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.570
 I would say the military is probably better at articulating the

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.130
 goals of the organization. Setting forth the objective and letting

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.690
 people know how they really should behave. The famous military historian

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.250
 Kagan has pointed out that Ulysses Grant was very good at saying

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.810
 'you need to take your division a move to that side of of the line,'

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.370
 he would say you need to move that side of the line so why because

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.930
 I need someone to support over there with artillery to keep them from

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.490
 moving in that direction, so you need to block them. So the guy

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.050
 knew what he was supposed to do not just what he had to do- but what

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.610
 am I supposed to accomplish. Civilian life I've had some bosses who

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.170
 never really explain to me what it was I was supposed to be accomplishing,

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.730
 or how it would be great to accomplish. Sometimes it's good

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.290
 sometimes it's bad but I think that military does a better job than

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.850
 civilians.
