00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.850
As an enlisted man in the marine corps, I spent about half my time in

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 the work uniform which was called utilities which were the green rough

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.850
 cloth uniforms that were worn in combat areas, or combat fatigues

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 which we wore in Vietnam. But then about half the time I was in dress

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.850
 uniform like when I was in language school in Washington DC we wore

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.850
 dress uniforms all the time, which was the green coat during the

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 winter months, or the khakis during summer months. When I got in the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 navy I start out wearing the bell bottom enlisted uniform but almost

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.850
 immediate with god in the officer ranks where I wore dress blues in

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.850
 the winter or summer whites in the summer, with full dress whites

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.850
 which were the choker whites uniforms, during that time. But almost

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 always the dress uniform, although I had work uniforms the navy for

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.850
 when I went to the range to qualify and was a range officer, for instance

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.850
 for marksmanship instruction
