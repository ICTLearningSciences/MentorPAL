00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.850
One of the things you find out in life is not just the money you make

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 it's the your sense of what you did that made a difference in the world

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.850
 that will determine whether you consider your career a success or

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 a failure. In the military, the work I did, cryptology, there are

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.850
 numerous examples in history about the effect of cryptology. The work

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.850
 from World War two were probably the most at stake was the fact that

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 the US solve the Japanese naval codes in World War two allowed them

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 to predict exactly what the Japanese were planning to do for the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.850
 battle of midway and ambush the Japanese fleet, thereby sinking a huge

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.850
 number of Japanese carriers, I think three or four carries with some

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.850
 fair along with their pilots in airplanes and made it such that

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 the Japanese never could replace, probably the major turning point in

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.850
 World War two in the Pacific. In the Atlantic, our ability to break

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.850
 because the Germans were using to station their submarines allowed

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.850
 us to win the war by keeping the sea lanes open to Great Britain so

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.850
 that's been a big difference. In computing, supercomputing, and academia

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.850
 clearly you know we were the ones rocking and rolling in the computer

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.850
 field so I feel like we're changing the world every day.
