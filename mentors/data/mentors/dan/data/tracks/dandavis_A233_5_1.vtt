00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.350
picking it college is a very personal choice you need to make it based

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.850
 on who you are and what you need a lot of people don't make it that

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.350
 way and I have to tell you I probably picked the wrong college should

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.850
 start at but concerning my background it just seemed like the way

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.350
 it was done both of my parents and guardians to large state public

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.850
 universities in the Midwest everybody I knew was interested in large

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.350
 university setting was so I went to the university of Colorado because

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.850
 he grew up in Colorado that wasn't a state school or was there and

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.350
 the biggest one in so I just kind of nationally went that way but

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.850
 I I don't think it was a very rational choice I don't think it was

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.350
 the optimal choice and the same with so when I went on to my graduate

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.850
 work I probably could have got accepted in different places but it

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.350
 was easy I had a wife by then I had a child on the way of so I just

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.850
 stayed where I was and finished up there
