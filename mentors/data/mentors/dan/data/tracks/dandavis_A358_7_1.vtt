00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.450
one of the great joys of being in the service in my mind at least it is

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.050
 the joy of working with people being part of the team in feeling that

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.650
 their dear old giving everything you've got to get to a goal it's

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.250
 one of the things that is best about the service %HESITATION so having

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.850
 somebody think ill of you or not think well of the work you do

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.450
 in the service is kind of a Downer %HESITATION so when you talk about

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.050
 cryptology it's kind of a mixed bag %HESITATION to some degree cryptologist

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.650
 reviewed as all you you have it easy you know in Vietnam we

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.250
 had flush toilets and air conditioning and and the guys out in the

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.850
 field were run around it you know in terrible conditions and going

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.450
 to hell %HESITATION so it was all a little different for us than it

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.050
 was for them %HESITATION on the other hand as favorite storyline is

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.650
 one of my compatriots %HESITATION was a cryptologist and got assigned

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.250
 to work with the elementary and actually was out in the commentary

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.850
 with them and one day because the work he was doing in his test out

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.450
 the Bernese he was able to throw back to flap to his tent in the whole

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.050
 route everybody hit the dirt we got incoming and the other two people

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.650
 all scrambled and got in their foxholes got their heads down and

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.250
 about thirty seconds later here came the mortar rounds and he said

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.850
 after that he there were no more comments about how he didn't have

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.450
 to go on patrol and he had it easy and somebody else had to carry his

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.050
 radio form or something because they knew he was a guy could save

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.650
 their life %HESITATION but by and large cryptologist are regarded as

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.250
 one of the really intellectual groups in the %HESITATION military

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.850
 and are seeing that way by a number of people
