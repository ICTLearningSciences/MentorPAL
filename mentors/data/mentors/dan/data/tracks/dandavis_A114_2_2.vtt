00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.210
number of things in my life we should not happen in a question I wish

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.580
 I had asked earlier was I wish that as someone in whom I had trust what

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.940
 are the indicia imminent failure and academic pursuits what should

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.300
 I look for that tells me now's not the time to continue to pursue

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.670
 schooling because I stayed with my first two years of college I stayed

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.030
 with it at least one year to the law and somebody along the line

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.400
 should of told me don't give up on going to college but you need to

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.760
 postpone it anti get your head screwed on straight and I never ask

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.120
 anybody that question and nobody ever offered me that implies and I

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.490
 basically wasted two years of my life digging a hole that they later

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.850
 had to fill in a whole lot of effort just give me back up
