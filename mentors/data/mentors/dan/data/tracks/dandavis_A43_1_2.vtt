People sometimes ask me considering the time you spend in the military

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.770
 what would you have done differently or what should you have done instead

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.230
 of what you did do, and I'm reminded of the story of General

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.700
 Alexander and Anthony Eden who went to Winston Churchill's funeral,

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.160
 and they were talking about their wartime experiences in World War Two,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.620
 on the steps of Saint Paul's after the service. And one of them

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.080
 said to the other, and I can't remember which way it went, 'don't you

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.540
 wish we had it all to do over again' and the other would responded

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.000
 'no we might not do half so well the next time,' and that's the way

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.470
 I feel about my military career. My military career has been such a

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.930
 joy to be and has gone so well that had I all the do it over again

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.390
 I'd say now just let me do it just the way it worked out. I enjoyed

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.850
 it just the way it worked out, I wouldn't change a damn thing
