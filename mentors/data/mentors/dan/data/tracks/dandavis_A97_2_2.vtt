I think when you're looking at cryptology the military and trying to get

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.350
 into cryptology the people who try to get you in this field will

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.600
 be the military recruiters and what they'll be looking for is very good

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.850
 test scores some demonstrated capability in academics that is a

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.100
 good academic record and a capability of following the rules to be in

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.350
 cryptology you must be a rule follower you can have a lot of adventure

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.600
 in your soul but if you think the rules are for somebody else you

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.850
 belong somewhere else because of classification issues.
