00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.590
one of the insights I got the marine corps was how close I am to my family

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.320
 that I never knew about it before I am very close to my family

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.060
 and three brothers two older and one younger had wonderful mom and dad

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.800
 good grades grandparents on both sides didn't have a lot of cousins

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.530
 but really really good failed when I was in Vietnam came along and

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.270
 my parents sent me a little fold up Christmas tree that I could put

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.010
 up on top of my locker where the Vietnam and when Christmas morning

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.740
 came I opened my locker and took out the presents that they'd sent

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.480
 me in the presence of my girlfriend it sent me for Christmas and several

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.220
 of the guys in the barracks room live came and watched me open

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.960
 my presents which is rather uncomfortable and I ask them what did your

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.690
 folks into anything for Christmas in several of them told me I don't

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.430
 even know where my parents live you know I lost track of a few

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.170
 years ago after I got a high school in I don't know where they are and

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.900
 what about your siblings non had a brother but I like him very much

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.640
 we don't talk I don't worries and that just really amazed me so I've

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.380
 always found time to stay in touch with my family but I did learn

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.110
 from that not everybody thinks that Sir activity worth putting in

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.850
 time at odds it varies from family to family and personal person
