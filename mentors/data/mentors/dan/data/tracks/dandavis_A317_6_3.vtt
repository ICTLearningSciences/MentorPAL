in the United States today some level of undergraduate education is kind

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.250
 of a requirement for almost everyone in the infield at least at the

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.950
 associates level so I knew that hole I was in the navy most people

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.650
 who are going up for chief petty officer better have an associate's

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.350
 degree or they're going to have a tougher time making chief so that's

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.050
 one thing to get ahead in your field you need a a degree of some

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.750
 kind so the degrees are built up the associates and the bachelor level

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.450
 degrees undergraduate degrees are built up basically of required

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.150
 courses showing that you have a certain skill level and that you have
