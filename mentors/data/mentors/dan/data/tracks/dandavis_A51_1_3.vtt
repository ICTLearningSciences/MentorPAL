A popular topic of discussion these days is stress the you know post traumatic

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.710
 stress syndrome and other symptoms dealing with stress. Admiral

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.640
 Arleigh Burke said there's no greater stress in life than the stress

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.560
 upon the commander in combat and that's may very well be true.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.490
 But there's a lot of stress even on non combat please the cryptologic

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.420
 community for instance someone should have to endure a great deal

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.350
 of danger and not be able to respond aggressively but were forced to

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.280
 do there cryptologic duties, even though there were as they use to

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.210
 say bullet holes appearing in the side of the tent. So there is stress

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.140
 and that can be stressful. But within my experience said stress

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.060
 which is understood by the service, is well treated by the service and

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.990
 relief was given for it. And the biggest help was the fact you were

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.920
 going through that stress with close comrades, who do together and

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.850
 that allows you all to enter the stress better
