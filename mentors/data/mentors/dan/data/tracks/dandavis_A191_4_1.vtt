it seems sometimes that some careers get hyped up because of examples

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.760
 of someone who's tremendously successful so I would definitely not recommend

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.210
 anyone go into stem work if they are swayed by the stories

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.670
 of how much money Bill Gates made her some because that always fails

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.120
 to mention the Bill Gates was a very special person and made his money

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.580
 in a way that the vast majority of us would have a prayer of doing

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.030
 so I don't think you should ever go into a field thank you all that

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.490
 guy's a billionaire I want to be a billionaire like him I I think

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.940
 you should not look at the money or the success of the fame as a goal

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.400
 you want to achieve I'd go after something you can do and enjoy be

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.850
 proud of and let the fame and the money coming that
