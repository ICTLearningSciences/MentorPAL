00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.350
one of the really good things about a stem career in stem careers are

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.850
 to some degree fungible that is you pick up skills in one that can be

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.350
 easily used and other factors a famous firm in Massachusetts solved

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.850
 all of us unsolvable problems by assigning biologists to physics problems

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.350
 and physicist a biological problem so it's it's not like what

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.850
 you learn a skill while you're stuck in that field but you do have

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.350
 to learn some basic skills to get going so I think I think that the

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.850
 critical thing is to get a good feel for things and not worry about

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.350
 what I have this skill I have to add that skill to swallow food here

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.850
 the college will put some requirements on you if you're going to do

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.350
 work in computer science are going to demand that you have a certain

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.850
 amount of mathematics
