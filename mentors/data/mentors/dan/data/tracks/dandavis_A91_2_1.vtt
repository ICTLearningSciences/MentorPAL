00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.850
Risk taking is always part of any employment or any career path and you

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 need to be alert to those and you need to analyze them carefully.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.850
 To some degree the degree of risk will be dependent on your personality

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 but on the some people like my father in law who did the same thing,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.850
 many of us don't like any kind of change some of us like the excitement

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.850
 of trying new things and going to new places you can do operator

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 in that field so you have to decide on your own how much risk

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 you want to take but in virtually every fields the people who get ahead

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.850
 the most will be those who can analyze and take the right risk when

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.850
 it's time to take them. Those who get ahead by avoiding risk and

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.850
 just doing their job even if they get promoted may not have the sense

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 of satisfaction that those who push the envelope right to the edge

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.850
 got from their job.
