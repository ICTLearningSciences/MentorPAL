00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.650
as nations seek to protect their secrets they have a two competing problems

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.450
 one is you don't want the enemy to know your secrets but the other

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.250
 is you want to make it easy for your own side to get all of the

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.050
 information they need to do their job and because the more people who

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.850
 were new there from nation the more likely it is the enemy will find

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.650
 out to to have that information so you have those two competing

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.450
 areas so they develop levels of classification to make it easy to disseminate

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.250
 but also easy for the enemy to get a whole of all the way

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.050
 up through very very limited dissemination and very hard for them to

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.850
 get a hold of in the United States these four levels typically are

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.650
 thought of as confidential the lowest level then the secret next level

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.450
 up then top secret and then beyond that there is some special programs

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.250
 %HESITATION called compartmented sensitive information which are

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.050
 top secret code word above where only those people who are brief

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.850
 to that particular program can see top secret code word material
