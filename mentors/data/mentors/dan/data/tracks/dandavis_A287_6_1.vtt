00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.120
stem science technology engineering and mathematics that's a pretty broad

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.380
 range of capabilities there and so they're a broad range of careers

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.650
 that you can follow some of them would involve clearly different

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.920
 kinds of lifestyle for instance if you're a civil engineer part of

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.180
 the engineering field you might spend most of your career outside with

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.450
 blueprints and you don't doing surveying and in building buildings

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.720
 that would be completely different the stem career in Peter programming

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.980
 where you're gonna spend your entire life in the lab doing program

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.250
 chemistry will lead you to a different career set I work to the

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.520
 other laboratories nor Chicago Illinois when we were doing drug manufacturing

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.780
 and learning how to do that so that completely different

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.050
 situations for all those career field it is as wide a range as you can

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.320
 almost conceive and it's hard to believe any person could not find

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.580
 some stem career that fit their own capabilities their own interest

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.850
 and their own proclivities
