you know questions like what's your favorite movie or your favorite color

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.800
 or your favorite person always struck me as kind of strange I have

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.270
 a huge number of favorites and I can't say that I prefer you need

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.740
 to one till all the rest of them combined overrode individually it's

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.220
 kind of hard to respond to only say this about movies you would guess

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.690
 being a military historian I love movies like Patton became mutiny

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.170
 Tora Tora Tora das boat these are all wonderful movies that tell

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.640
 me something about what combat is like it was like to be in those particular

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.110
 wars but but you'd probably be surprised at some of the kind

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.590
 of trivial movies I enjoy one of my favorite movies for instance is

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.060
 the old movie worth Carl Reiner and Brian Keith Alan Arkin Jonathan

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.530
 winters just a host of people for rescinded host of other people called

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.010
 the Russians are coming the Russians are coming about a straight

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.480
 a Russian submarine in New England island so those are some of my

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.960
 favorite movies but if you want to find out more you can always go

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.430
 to my website online I've got a whole section on movies in those I like

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.900
 in those and out like in those who are important to me and some

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.380
 that I like that I don't think anybody else in the world like so that's

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.850
 kind of a more general answer
