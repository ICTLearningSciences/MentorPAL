00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.410
Well if it turns out you're not really good at it, or you don't want to

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.970
 do what you want to do and you want to change careers you might be

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.540
 able to do that. One of my best friends was an academy graduate, and

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.100
 his first job was as a missile officer and he hated being a missile

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.660
 officer, so he crossed transferred branches into their cryptologic

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.230
 community within his service, and was allowed to do that, but it was

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.790
 very difficult. And he was counseled by some fairly high ranking officers

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.350
 about why he shouldn't do that and how it would hurt his career

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.910
 and keep him from advancing. But he did get that finally approved,

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.470
 he made the switch and he retired as a full colonel in the airforce.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.040
 So you can make a switch, but boy it's really tough to do that you'd

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.600
 almost be better to finish your tour of duty whatever it is and

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.160
 then enlist in another service, and ask for special duty in that other

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.730
 service in the field you really think you'd like to be in. But by

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.290
 and large try to find joy in what you've been assigned to do and do

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.850
 the best you can that you be best off.
