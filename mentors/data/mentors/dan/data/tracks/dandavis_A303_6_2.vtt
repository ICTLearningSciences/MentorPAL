00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.230
a question about whether something or someone is real or not is difficult

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.600
 to respond to what is reality but what is real mean I I assume when

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.970
 people discuss are you real in terms of the computer generated rated

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.350
 avatar this responding like I've been responding to your questions

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.730
 that the question is do I exist at this time and what exists right

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.100
 now is a videotape of what I said some time ago but I am also it

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.470
 existence in a separate way in a separate place so I guess I'm real

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.850
 both ways
