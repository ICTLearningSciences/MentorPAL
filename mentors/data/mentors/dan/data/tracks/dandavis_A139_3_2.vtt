00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.120
The hiring process is a difficult one for me to describe with any certainty

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.390
 because I've gone through several and none of them I think has

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.650
 been standard. In almost every case someone inside of the organization

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.920
 to which I was being hired knew about me had asked me to join up

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.190
 with that organization, the only difference would have been the when

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.460
 I joined the marine corps in that case I just went and talked all

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.730
 4 military recruiters, Air Force army navy and marine corps, and basically

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.000
 ask them who will guarantee me a chance go to Vietnam. And the

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.260
 marine corps was the ones who said "yeah if you join up you're going

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.530
 to Vietnam" so that's all there is to it. But when I went into lawm

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.800
 after I got out of law school at new practice with my father who

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.070
 had practiced in Colorado springs for years, so there wasn't any hiring

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.340
 process there, just and work with them. And when he passed away

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.610
 I, you know, exactly what you saw was still practicing law in one of

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.870
 my good friends from the reserve unit where I was working said "you

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:25.140
 know I know you're not happy practicing law but why don't you join

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.410
 mark Marietta and work for us on this technical project that requires

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.680
 the kind of clearance you have". And so I said "well that's pretty

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.950
 good I'll do that". So I went there. And then another friend of mine

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.220
 from the, at mark Marietta who's also reservist said "you know they

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.480
 need somebody out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Mark Marietta

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.750
 to work out there went you see if they'll transfer you out there",

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.020
 because my wife loves the ocean I thought well that's good will go

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.290
 to Los Angeles and then she'll be able to go to the ocean more. So I

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.560
 got that job because somebody suggested. And while I was at JPL, a

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.830
 project came up that we were kind of briefed on, and we were working

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.090
 on, and fellow who was in the project was the head of the high performance

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.360
 computing center at Caltech, and he kinda liked me, so he said

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.630
 "Dan, why don't you quit working at JPL for mark and other income

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.900
 work for Caltech and help me run this supercomputing centers". So I

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.170
 became the assistant director there, again a friend, and then on my

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.440
 own kind of I got to know some people at University of Southern California

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.700
 and one of them said, "why don't you come to university of Southern

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.970
 California, we'll pay you more than cal tech does", which is

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.240
 always an inducement. And so I did that and that worked out fine. And

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.510
 then some people who knew me asked me to come try to get the high

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.780
 performance computing center for the university of Hawaii, and I did

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.050
 that so I worked out there for awhile and that that also was kind

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.310
 of fun. And we got to got to do that, so I didn't really have a hiring

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.580
 process in any of those I just kind of somebody grease the skids

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.850
 for me and I got right in.
