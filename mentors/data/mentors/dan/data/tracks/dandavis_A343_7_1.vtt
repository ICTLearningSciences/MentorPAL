00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.200
in order to get access to classified information %HESITATION you someone

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.560
 has to say this person should have access to that information and

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.910
 that process is called getting a security clearance and the security

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.260
 clearances very just like in their levels just like the classic five

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.610
 material does that is it's very easy to get a confidential %HESITATION

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.970
 clearance that can be done by local story a secret clearance can

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.320
 be done by you just doing a national agency check that is check with

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.670
 the FBI and very other crime and sit agencies to see if %HESITATION

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.030
 this person has got a criminal record then beyond that you get to

 top secret level where people are actually going out into the field

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.730
 talking to people who know you asking then if you're trustworthy looking

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.090
 if you have any problems in your background that the records

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.440
 would have shown up and then the very top level of course the is the

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.790
 code word of programs and those are very hard to get a clearance because

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.140

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.500
 examination that regularly to make sure that the classified material

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.850
 is secure
