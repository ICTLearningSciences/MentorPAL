00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.900
there is always some danger involved any time in the military they're

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.950
 training accidents during World War two they lost exactly as many pilots

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.990
 and aircraft from training accidents as they did from enemy combat

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.040
 it's dangerous work you're doing dangerous things in Vietnam where

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.090
 I served I stepped on a spike when we were working on the the trench

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.140
 line one day and drove the spike always to the top of my foot so

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.180
 there's there's that kind of danger all the time but you have the added

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.230
 danger if you're in a combat zone of of having someone shoot at

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.280
 you or or try to fire a rocket or mortar at you I guess the most dangerous

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.330
 thing I ever did was once when we were under a mortar attack

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.370
 it food by I was crossing a large field to get to that trench line

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.420
 where I was assigned to be she got her if we got hit by an attack not

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.470
 just the rockets mortars as I crossed that feel I had the sense that

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.520
 there was a mortar round that was fired up in the air was coming

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.560
 right down on top in my head and I made myself not run I mean myself

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.610
 keep walking assuming that the sense I had that was get hit me was

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.660
 false it would not hit me and that to run would be giving way to my

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.710
 own fear that I was walking along in the round finally came down to

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.750
 but it was you know like a couple football fields for me to learn meters

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.800
 it so winner so was in a particular danger to the but that was

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.850
 probably bored dangers
