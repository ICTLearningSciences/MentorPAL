00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.970
Both of the military and your civilian life you're gonna find a lot of

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.100
 times we have to move and that's going to change up things. One of

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.230
 the good things about being in the military if you like moving is that

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.350
 you're not stuck in one place for the rest your life and you're not

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.470
 stuck with one group of people you get to meet new people if you

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.600
 love people you get to meet new people you love if you don't love people

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.730
 you get to get away from the people you don't want. So it's it

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.850
 works out well both ways and when you move the military's particularly

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.970
 adept at accepting new people into the unit because there's always

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.100
 someone new coming into the unit and you remember when you're the

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.230
 new guy and how well you were treated or poorly then you try to treat

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.350
 the new guys that way too. So that's that's really good deal. In civilian

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.470
 life it's a little tougher when you move, because people some

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.600
 stick to one place and never move in their entire life but a lot of

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.730
 people do move around so one inside have had I would warn you about

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.850
 is most new guys when they get to the new place say wait a minute

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.970
 here's how we did in the old place and that work really well don't don't

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.100
 jump on that right away don't jump on that right away wait and

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.230
 maybe the way they do it in the new place works well for them and your

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.350
 only that you get it worked well for you guys would work so just

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.470
 peace you know get get in tune with the new way the way they do it and

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.600
 then then make a decision thing we can improve this little by borrowing

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.730
 this little thing from the old way. But that's that's moving

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.850
 brings up those issues.
