00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.590
The solution of technical issues in the stem fields is always very very

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.330
 interesting and I have had in both my military and my civilian life

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.070
 technical issues confront me which I had to work on. To give you an

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.810
 example in cryptology without going into anything is pretty good classified

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.550
 if I can, we were all looking at how to recognize the particular

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.290
 non voice signal that is an electronic signal that was propagated,

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.040
 but had to be identified, and the question was 'could you identify

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.780
 it better by ear or by a oscilloscope tracing?' And the oscilloscope

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.520
 tracing gave you some parameters that could be compared for instance

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.260
 by digitizing the the aveform and analyzing the digitized waveform.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.000
 We found strange slid off that the human ear was better at detecting

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.740
 the difference signals and it could detect that kind of equipment

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.480
 that was emitting that signal and surprisingly enough, it's hard

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.220
 to explain the physics in the physiology of this, it could even detect

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.960
 a particular machine. That is the signal is different enough that

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.700
 the human ear listening could couldn't even tell you what the difference

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.440
 was, but they can say that's machine in place A-prime and the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.180
 other single was machine via place B prime. And think about that

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.920
 when you hear my voice compared to Cary Grant's voice how can you tell

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.660
 it's me and not Cary Grant or vice versa. You just do as somehow

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.410
 you can pick out those very fine different sets of technical issues.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.150
 Technical issues in the civilian world looking at payroll processing

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.890
 how you break down a huge problem and rode on a bunch of processors,

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.630
 used to be just ten or twenty, but then I got to use hundreds and

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.370
 then thousands and then tens of thousands of processors that's a very

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.110
 interesting theoretical issue and a practical one that I had to solve.
