00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.250
At two hundred thirty five pounds it's hard for me to think that I have

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.650
 any least favorite foods. I like eating even though I'm six six, two

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.050
 thirty five is a little on the heavy side but I eat almost everything.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.450
 Least favorite probably could steamed vegetables almost any kind.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.850
 I love raw vegetables but once you cook them and they get kinda

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.250
 soft I don't like them much anymore. And the food I never would try

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.650
 or the Philippine balutes, a balute is fertilized egg with the fertilized

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.050
 embryo inside, so little unborn baby chicken, the egg they ferment

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.450
 until it's half rotten then eat it. They're wonderful I never have

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.850
 had one but given the opportunity I think I'd probably pass
