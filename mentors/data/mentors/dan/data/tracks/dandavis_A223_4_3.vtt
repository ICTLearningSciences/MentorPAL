what other things that nature has given us is a wonderful system of balancing

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.410
 its inner inner ear and some people are more sensitive that

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.680
 than others and if they get into a vehicle that's moving rolling it

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.960
 makes them sick and everyone gets sick to some degree but there are

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.240
 extremes on both sides I fortunately was blessed with windows cast iron

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.520
 stomachs never get seasick we were in Pensacola once on active duty

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.790
 and we read today fifty foot boat and went up red snapper fishing

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.070
 and I had been in the marine corps but everybody else board was of

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.350
 real salt water sailor they don't everybody got sick on that boat except

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.630
 maybe to make me sick bet but on the other hand lord admiral Nelson

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.910
 who won the battle of Trafalgar the greatest naval hero of all

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.180
 time was famous for being so seasick when he first went to see every

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.460
 time he went to see that he would have to go to this cabin for days

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.740
 before he could get a stomach settled down again so it's one of the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.020
 things you just kinda have to put up with but if you're the average

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.290
 person you'll have a little of that if you're on one extreme or the

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.570
 other you'll have to learn to live with whatever the good lord gave

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.850
 you and it's not the end of the world it'll work out
