00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.210
Well I had kind of an interesting way to go through the service. After

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.580
 I'd work my way up from boot camp to morse code training to language

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.940
 school to some advanced training and then duty in combat zones. I

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.300
 got out of the Marine Corps and joined the Navy because I got all that

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.670
 the Marine Corps and had gotten out of the Marine Corps as a staff

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.030
 sergeant and A six, the Navy let me list as an E six cryptologic technician

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.400
 interpretive branch one. So it is a first class petty officer

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.760
 CTI one. That was my first position and that position is charged

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.120
 with doing various translations of foreign languages that are products

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.490
 of the cryptologic process but I think it's by as much as I can

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.850
 see about that.
