00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.590
questions about people who died in the military or questions about people

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.320
 who you may have killed in the military are always very sensitive

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.060
 issues to raise to someone until you get to know them pretty well

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.800
 but let me just say about what I just fax so you'll know I was in a

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.530
 unit in Vietnam that was comprised of about a hundred people we had

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.270
 two people who are on the wall in the Vietnam memorial in Washington

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.010
 DC master sergeant storm and chief gates died in the Vietnam I knew

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.740
 them well enough to visit with him and talk to them I didn't know much

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.480
 about their families or their history or anything but enough to

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.220
 nod in talk baseball with the more professional matters they did not

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.960
 die my presence they died away from me but those are two I didn't know

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.690
 who died in military on the other hand home I had more than four

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.430
 of my friends and I see more than because you're a couple people I

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.170
 knew in the marine corps who died I couldn't really consider for this

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.900
 but let's say for my friends who died in the marine corps from noncombat

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.640
 reasons and in three of those cases blues automobile accidents

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.380
 in the last case it was an accidental drowning is nears the neighborhood

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.110
 establish didn't anything to do with there being in the service
