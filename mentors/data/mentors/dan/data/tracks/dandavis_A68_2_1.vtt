The Navy historically has had a different way of assigning a break what

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.290
 we would call Reagan most services to its sailors and that is called

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.520
 their rate. In my case when I was a cryptologist, I was a C. T. ,cryptologic

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.740
 technician, one, which means I was like A six of which would

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.960
 be a staff sergeant in the army and that was my rate. C. T. on

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.180
 the other hand is what they call a rating and that describes the kind

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.410
 of work you do in that case you're a technical person working on cryptology.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.630
 That is, the understanding the analysis and the breaking

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.850
 of codes.
