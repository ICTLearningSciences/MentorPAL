I think a major misconception about the Navy is that the leadership barking

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.850
 orders and being snotty to everybody. I feel like the Navy and

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.350
 to some degree in the Marine Corps are much more management oriented.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.850
 Your commanding officer in the junior officers and the senior petty

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.350

 drill instructors screaming at you on the drill field and that's

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.350
 that's been my experience and I think a lot of people still make that

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.850
 mistake largely driven by movies who seemed invariably characterized

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.350
 lawsuits as stupid and malicious and evil and violent people and

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.850
