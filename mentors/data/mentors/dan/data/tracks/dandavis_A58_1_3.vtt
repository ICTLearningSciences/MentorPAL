00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.770
The armed forces have always been beset by a lack of career orientation

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.680
 of first time enlistees and it still is. So virtually all of the turnover

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.600
 is after the first enlistment is up. So after a guy signs up

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.520
 does his four yearsm sees how you like it or not, sees other opportunities

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.430
 on the outside, they may leave they may leave like I did and

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.350
 then immediately get in the reserves because they enjoy that part of

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.270
 it, I or they may leave and never want anything to do with it again.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.180
 So in terms of turnover but you mainly see is junior enlisted people

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.100
 usually E3s or E4s, sometimes E fives and sixes getting out, sometimes

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.020
 you see junior officers, O2's or so. An O2 would be like a first

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.930
 lieutenant army a lieutenant JG in the navy getting out after their

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.850
 first tour
