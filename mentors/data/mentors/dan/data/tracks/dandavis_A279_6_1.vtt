00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.430
I was in the reserves for about twenty four years and that would run from

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.020
 nineteen seventy one up to the very first part of the decade of

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.600
 the nineteen nineties that some of those were not good years because

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.180
 of having trouble getting orders life but it was in that the in the

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.770
 reserves that long and that's the regular drilling reserve center was

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.350
 in standby reserves for another decade stand by reserve she don't

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.930
 do drilling but you are eligible for recall if there is a war at that

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.520
 time hi res retired from the reserves and I'm still literally recall

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.100
 I mean during war where two people of my vintage were called back

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.680
 to active duty to do things couldn't Duff be an infantryman of any

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.270
 kind of quality but I could probably teach in rots your something like

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.850
 that
