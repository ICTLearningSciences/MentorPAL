00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.620
my father who was an accountant and a lawyer told me once the difference

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.400
 between a professional and nonprofessional is when the professional

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.170
 goes home at night he still work his mind is still wrestling with

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.940
 the problems he faced during the day he's thinking about how we can

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.710
 better handle his client's money or how he's going to handle his client's

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.490
 case and I think the same is true with the stem person educator

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.260
 or a person in the military who's a professional as soon as I got

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.030
 off duty in the marine corps we all went to the club and started drinking

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.800
 beer and what we talk about how we can heal Jones Jones is a

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.580
 very good marksman and he's having trouble you know when he's on the

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.350
 firing line what we can do about Jones can we give them a different

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.120
 job how can you do that neither Smith smiths very athletic the police

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.900
 got a bad attitude would be the best thing to do to get his attitudes

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.670
 she's got a lot of time the club which you think you were socializing

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.440
 really working on problems and the same is true with my work

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.210
 instead when I worked at the laboratories in Chicago we used to have

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.990
 the leader who would take us out for pizza and beer every noon on Friday

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.760
 and the vast majority though noon Friday of watches gotten out

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.530
 about six o'clock at night when it's time to go get another pizza and

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.300
 but again if you come into the club when we were over at the club

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.080
 drinking at that you heard us talk about business the whole time but

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.850
 our problems or put your wrestling
