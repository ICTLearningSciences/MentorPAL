00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.920
From the time I was in junior high school is very interested in electronics,

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.980
 so I mastered electronics back when the lot of electronics were

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.050
 still tube orientated, long before transistors. And then we got into

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:21.120
 transistors and I was interested always through, and when they got

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.180
 in the military I got into a line of work that involved a lot of

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.250
 technology, that is cryptology. I worked with a lot of electronic gear-

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.320
 maintaining and repairing and optimizing as we went along. So that

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.380
 was very useful to me. When I got out of the military I when I first

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.450
 started back in college they were offering some introductory courses

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.520
 in computer programming and this was brand new in computers because

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.580
 there were those times kinds of things before that. But when I

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.650
 got out of the marine corps went back to university of Colorado where

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.720
 the first courses I took was a course in fortran four and I was writing

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.780
 programs on one of Seymour Cray's early supercomputers, a CDC

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.850
 five hundred and I've been interested in computers ever since.
