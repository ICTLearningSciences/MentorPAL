00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.750
During my years in the military I started out as a private in the marine

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.650
 corps and finally retired as a commander in the Navy during all that

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.550
 time I was in cryptology. I started out as a Morse code intercept

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.450
 operator and then was sent to language school to learn Vietnamese,

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.350
 did active duty is that but when I was in the reserve duty, most my

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.250
 reserve duty was done as an officer where I was setting up cryptologic

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.150
 training programs and cryptologic activities for the enlisted people.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.050
 In retiring as a commander I had a unit of about ninety people

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.950
 in Denver, Colorado they're all cryptologists, largely from the navy

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.850
 but a few marines and one Air Force officer
