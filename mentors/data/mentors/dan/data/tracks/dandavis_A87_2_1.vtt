00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.850
Failure is always a tough thing to face for all of us and in every field

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 it's approach differently a lot of that is due to personality. The

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.850
 major thing in both my work as a cryptologist and as a an academic

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 researcher is I work in cutting edge fields where there was a lot of

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.850
 failure you know it's more like baseball you know a good hitter only

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.850
 hits three out of ten times the other seven times he doesn't get

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 very far. On-base pitted percentage might be a better example of that

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 but you get the drift. I think failure is well accepted in both fields

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.850
 failure even the military of course I can be a mire failure you

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.850
 didn't defend your position well enough and therefore some untoward

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.850
 things happen or could be a major failure you failed in a way that

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 resultants in somebody good getting killed and not achieving admission.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.850
 So the one thing about the military is I think they're very forgiving

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.850
 of failure but all of the snow the failure might cause somebody's

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.850
 life, unnecessarily and that and many different things, but in terms

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.850
 of the management reaction to that kind of failure I think both

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.850
 academia and military were pretty good at saying we knew you were out

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.850
 on a limb you know if you fell off you fell off we're sorry but we

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.850
 will only get you.
