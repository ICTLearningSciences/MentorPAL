00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.520
 of the very important things I think I have to tell you that you corporate

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.350
 is your ability to communicate you mean more to you than you

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.180
 may say you may say or if I do my job right or five discover new things

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.020
 or if I produce something that everybody needs that will be fine

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.850
