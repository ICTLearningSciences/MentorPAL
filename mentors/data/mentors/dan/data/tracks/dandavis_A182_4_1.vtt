00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.210
in pursuing high performance computing I've worked for about seven years

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.560
 with Lockheed Martin and then I've works of some twenty twenty five

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.920
 years since then and academia I would have to say I prefer academia

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.280
 because academia yeah is more focused on ideas and less focused on

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.640
 money I am greeted not by how much money I make or how much money

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.990
 and bring in for what kind of publications are publishing what can ideas

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.350
 I have what I can tribute and I enjoy that more than having to

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.710
 grind out everything in a way that makes money my experience in the

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.060
 private sector was some of the things we did they were illegal and probably

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.420
 where even though that's cool but they were certainly money

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.780
 grubbing and that didn't sit well with me are there others who are more

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.140
 entrepreneurial who like that kind of challenge how can I make money

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.490
 out of this and they would be more happy with private sector than

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.850
 I am
