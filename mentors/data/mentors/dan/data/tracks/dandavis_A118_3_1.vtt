00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.000
In both the fields in which I work in my life the biggest barrier to entry

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.160
 is intellectual capability. The marines in Vietnam were very proud

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.310
 of the fact that isn enlisted men in cryptology, our test requirements

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:21.470
 were higher than the test requirements for people who wanted

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.620
 to go to officer training school and become officers, so that was one

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.770
 level. The second level was the clearance a lot of young people growing

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.930
 up having a good time sowing there wild loads, you know what everybody's

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.080
 doing it too, and a lot of them wind up with something on

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.230
 their record that will prevent them from getting a clearance in the

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.390
 future. It's true when I was coming through this line of work and it's

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.540
 still true today and it's true to some degree about academia as

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.700
 well. You know you you need to have a good record of accomplishment

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.850
 and not a record of misbehavior.
