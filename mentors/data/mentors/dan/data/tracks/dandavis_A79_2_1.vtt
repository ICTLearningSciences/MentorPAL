00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.850
I think the most common misconception about my STEM field is computer

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 programming and computer research is frequently is seen as being one

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.850
 hundred percent devoted to writing computer code or working on computer

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 machinery. But the fact of the matter is I don't know poll myself

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.850
 and kept track of this the vast majority of your time over your career

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.850
 is going to be reading and writing English. Not C++ or Fortran

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 or Java. So you better get good at writing English so what other misconceptions

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 is if I am a good Java writer to find a good C programmer

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.850
 if I can knock off Fortran in my sleep I don't have to know English.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.850
 Wrong you're gonna have to know English for a number of reasons

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.850
 that I can discuss later if you'd like. In the military one of the misconceptions

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 about the military is that everybody in the military gets

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.850
 a rifle and ammunition and they go shoot at people even in the army

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.850
 that's not true. In the army, only one quarter of the people go

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.850
 to combat arms - infantry armor, paratroops and artillery are the the

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.850
 for combat arms. If you're one of the one in four who gets into combat

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.850
 arms chances are only one and two that you are having to do with

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.850
 the weapon. You know it's if you go on to armour for instance you're

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.850
 just as likely to be a fuel tone tray a fuel truck driver as you

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.850
 are to be a tank drive. So the army has a lot less people running around

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.850
 shooting people in the whole thing. You know we're already down

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.850
 to an eighth to the people you know half of those people who see combat

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.850
 that's sixteen and the people who see combat only have what we

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.850
 get to fire their weapons for one reason or another so that's one third

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.850
 it's only one thirty people in the army ever gonna fires weapons.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.850
 And then you'll talk to guide the infantry got sent to Afghanistan

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.850
 so what about over their shot, but yeah but not everybody went to Afghanistan

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.850
 with him a lot of guys go to Afghanistan. I've known tons

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.850
 who never saw the enemy, they never got fireworks weapon anybody. So

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.850
 that's a major misconception that military school people go around

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.850
 killing people with a weapon. Nope.
