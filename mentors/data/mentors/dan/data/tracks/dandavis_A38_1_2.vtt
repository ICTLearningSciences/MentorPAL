00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.850
Because I was in the Cryptologic service I did not do a port call per

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:14.850
 se, because most cryptologists don't spend a lot of time at sea. So

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:21.850
 I would tell you that it over my career I spent time in San Diego, camp

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:28.850
 Pendleton, Washington DC, Pensacola, Florida, several tours at fort

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 Meade. Overseas I have been places like Hong Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam,

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.850
 Thailand, London in the UK, Naples, Italy, I stopped once in France.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:49.850
 So quite a few visits to varying places. Another classic port call

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:56.850
 because it wasn't because my ship was stopping there but because

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.850
 I was traveling. I also spent time in Japan Australia, Okinawa Hawaii

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:10.850
 been been all over had good times every place
