00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.180
speaking from my own experience the ability for a female or a member of

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.520
 the minority to join the stem career he is completely done then unhampered

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.850
 in the United States I have worked in the military at work

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.180
 for businesses and I've worked in academia and I have never seen anyone

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.520
 suggest that they were restricting hiring somebody because of their

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.850
 sex gender ethnicity for any reason other than are they capable

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.180
 of doing the work so I think it's pretty wide open and there is even

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.520
 an aggressive attempt to try to achieve a better balance of ethnicity

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.850
 and gender within stem careers in both academia and industry
