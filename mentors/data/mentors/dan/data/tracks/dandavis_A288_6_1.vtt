00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.040
I think of my life is being built up basically of two different kinds

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.230
 of stem careers the first was my stem career in cryptology stem careers

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.410
 in cryptology are broken into subsections in the first one I'd like

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.600
 to talk about is kind of the electronic warfare section these the

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.790
 papal then analyze well emissions from varying kinds of electronic

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.970
 year somewhere intended emissions like raiders like some are not like

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.160
 keyboards you met and they study the characteristics of those waveforms

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.350
 and try to get intelligence out of them you also have people

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.540
 who are collection specialist in that feel they have to know communication

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.730
 techniques and capabilities in the physics behind them for instance

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.910
 and they do the collection then you have the analyst in these

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.100
 frequently or people who specialize in both encryption encoding of

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.290
 information and they're very heavily laden with people who are excellent

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.470
 in mass so you get people doing that then you get a group the linguist

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.660
 in the linguist are probably the furthest from the stem fields

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.850
 at per se in that little more you work they do is more in the other

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.040
 kind of liberal arts section of things but even they have to have

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.230
 a good grasp of mathematics because the they assist both the collection

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.410
 people and the analytic people doing their jobs they're doing so

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.600
 there are a range of fields and tell in computer science let's it's

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.790
 limited to computer science research there's a lot of feel range there

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.970
 to largely in who can work for computer science research can be

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.160
 done in universities it can be a little softer or unit can be hardware

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.350
 oriented you can do the same kinds of things for industries you

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.540
 can be a programmer or you can be a developer of hard work my younger

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.730
 brother for instance went to work for IBM are developing hardware

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.910
 for laptop computers and then with IBM soldier laptop business to Lenovo

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.100
 in China he worked over there and flew to China and Japan all the

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.290
 time developing here's he he got a PhD in computer science so that

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.470
 was what he did with his degree a so wide range of things in computer

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.660
 science research alone as well as thinkable service and the salesman

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.850
 structural duties that you could have in those fields
