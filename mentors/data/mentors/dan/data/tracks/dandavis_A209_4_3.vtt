I think I have seen more miserable people who when they were considering

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.740
 their future we're swayed by some external factor such as my friend

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.180
 is in that field or my parents did that kind of work or I was good

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.630
 at it in school or I saw a movie about it once and that looks like

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.070
 fun without really knowing what every day of that work entails and

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.520
 the thing I think you should concentrate on is trying to understand

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.960
 what it is do you enjoy doing and understand what it is the varying

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.410
 professions would have you do every day not the startlingly make movies

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.850
 about the sort of thing you do air every day
