An NCO or petty officer in the navy is a non commissioned officer and

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.630
 that means there are people who have certain responsibilities in leadership

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.520
 but people who have not gotten a commission from the president

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.410
 of the United States. So they are the kind the middle managers of

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.290
 the military organization. Typically the word flows down from the admirals

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.180
 the generals chief of staff through the senior commissioned

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.070
 officers to junior commissioned officers who who then pass the word

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.960
 on to the chiefs and senior sergeants who then pass the word on to the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.850
 enlisted personnel
