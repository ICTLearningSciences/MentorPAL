    to a little bit more they understand that you''re very similar to them you might
    even have a very similar story that they have which creates that relationship
    and build that trust and communication and then other times depend upon the situation

    to trying to get them there I mean there''s different things you can do when the
    first things that I recommend is you know taking a pause taking a step back and
    reassess what''s going on is there something that you''re missing as a leader
    that maybe isn''t necessarily coming down to their level to help them make that
    mission achievement is there something going on personally in their life that
    you''re not aware of that has them you know not fully engage with their at work
    to make that mission accomplishment might find that after you talk with them that
    there is something going on personal and they''re unable to focus and so that
    was the issue and so you can try and help them resolve that issue or get them
    to the people that can help them resolve that in that way it''ll help hopefully
    bring them back online and get them focused again if you''ve kind of tried all
    that and you''re you''re basically at your wits and you really don''t know what
    to do obviously need to communicate that on up and say listen here the steps that
    I''ve taken to try and help my team make this mission successful or meet mission
    objectives and we''re just missing it tried ABCD any and we were you know here''s
    what we''ve done here''s the relevant proof that we''re making the best attempt
    it''s just it''s not achievable based on the situation that we have or the equipment
    or even the people that I have were unable to make that you have to communicate
    that up and communicated up early so that way set certain things to be put in
    line to maybe help bring that team or maybe they re assess what they''re asking
    you to do and and realize that that actually is unachievable and where it''s a
    big ask and nobody looked at it that way and now that you''ve tried everything
    and you''ve put out several you know courses of action and you''ve tried all those
    and are not working maybe we need to re assess what''s going on so you might find
    that''s helpful if it is achievable and you''ve just tried everything then the
    next piece is maybe you start to do a little bit of a counseling session with
    if it a particular individual and you''ve tried everything you might have to do
    some counseling with them '

  transcript: 'there are so many different ways in the navy that you can reward your
    sailors for good performance when you first have to do is just figure out what
    motivates your people you know because what motivates one person is gonna be different
    from somebody else if I''ve got somebody who''s been performing really well and
    I know that they enjoy time off then that might be what I reward them with his
    an extra day off we''re going home early or something like that if I got another
    individual who doesn''t really care about time off because they''re really driven
    and just like to work and perform up maybe I actually given more responsibility
    because that''s what they''re been seeking they want to show that they''re capable
    of taking on more so I give them that might have other individuals that are really
    you know looking for that kind of a ward or credit or something so put him in
    for the award so you you have to really just understand what drives a motive each
    each one of those individuals and then you know work towards that whenever they''re
    doing good things but always let your people know when they''re doing something
    good you know even just that that subtle it in the middle of the day Hey really
    doing you know I appreciate what you''re doing or that looks great even just that
    single comment when they''ve been working hard like that looks great are you really
    doing well there that might be enough to continue to push them on to finish that

    in your leadership styles how you can award them and reward them as well as what
    you can do with them putatively when you start dealing with civilians or certain
    lines that you just can''t cross that you might have to understand what their
    actual statement of work is and where they''re lateral lines and limits are because
    what you think you could ask a military person to do they''ll be able to do but
    a particular civilian whether government employer contractor is pretty much limited
    to what statement of work says that they can do I if you start asking them to
    do things out of that scope you can get them in trouble you can get yourself in
    trouble so you really got to understand you know what their limits are and then
    work around that and understand that you can''t necessarily hold them to the same
    punitive standard as you could a military member but they also do have their avenues
    to where let''s say you do have a civilian employee is not meeting the standards
    becoming difficult obviously you can''t discipline them yourself you might have
    to go directly to their supervisor or the the the contract supervisor whoever

    which was we had a particular piece of gear one of our you you vis which is about
    twelve feet in length and weighs about six hundred pounds and it''s really been
    tied to launching recovering from an eleven meter read and these eleven meter
    ribs you can only move them in theater from one place to another based on particular
    err strategically for choir miss that are there it''s very difficult to kind of
    get aircraft that you can fit an eleven meter ribbons side so we thought outside
    the box and figured how can we move this piece of equipment using the most smallest
    platform that we have in our arsenal which is a very small combat rubber rating
    crafter creek so this was out on deployment and we found kind of a construction
    site that had some left over plywood and foam and we basically developed a sled
    device that we were able to pull this vehicle up on two in tow behind our smallest
    platformer smallest creek that had just a thirty five horsepower engine and still
    be able to be combat effective and deploy the equipment searching for mines all
    across the theater so from that are admiral happened actually see what we have
    developed out of wood and phone Khan and got nicknamed the spruce goose and later
    he actually funded a program to develop a more robust proto type and here we are
    five years later we actually have eighteen of these operational prototypes being
    worked right now they''ve gone through several different iterations and there
    now part of the X. MCM companies tower table of allowances and they deploy with
    these things that provide us an opportunity to basically get to where we need
    to without being strong arm to using the eleven meter crew of red '

    retire from here but because I enjoy the work that I''m doing so much and as long

    trying take hold of something and and leave from the get go or else you''re not

    to get together with them first and kind of understand what their challenges are

    is obviously getting to understand your people first and and understanding what
    their strengths and weaknesses are and how you can use those to progress not only
    their personal and professional development for but the group as a whole as long
    as the group is moving forward and that in turn is going to allow the commands
    mission to move forward and increase mission readiness which in and will then
    move the entire navy''s mission forward as well and if every command is doing
    that then the the entire projection of the navy is going to be in a more positive
    direction so you can see where that starts with the very most junior person and
    understanding what their strengths are and promoting those type of attributes
    and how that then rolls into the platoon or division or department that you work
    and strengthens that entire organization and that in turn strengthens the command
    moves on towards the rest of the fleet and then in turn the navy as a whole so
    I think you know the very first steps is is understanding what your junior personnel
    on the personal at your leading whether their junior or your peers or what have
    you what their strengths and weaknesses are and what their direction what influences

    because that way the individual feels like they can open up more as opposed to
    trying to be a little stifled because they see this or you know the chief from

    important thing and then afterwards one of the board members pulled me aside and
    he said no your mission is always the single most important aspect to everything
    because without understanding the mission with that priority is and you can''t
    really understand how to prioritize your people and take care of them and so you
    need to really understand the mission if you don''t need to get out and read what
    your commander''s intent is what they''re guiding principles mission and vision

    the entire triad weather communities is very formal and your dress them by their

    kind of be looked at and ostracized as an outsider if you are too formal if you

    more informal get it works that same way people gonna look at you a little bit
    different not take you seriously and is going to jeopardize your role as a leader

    at your leading still understand where that leadership line ladies so sure you
    might work side by side with your people I''ve even on certain appointments I

    and mines under the water and now we''ve moved forward using unmanned underwater
    vehicles to do this line of work so what that does is it you know reduces the

    miles away and you''re still using equipment to do that as well as it''s helping
    to reduce that time line that we have in mind countermeasures so as you know things

    has their own you know guidance in mission and vision statement and then continue

    to than the president''s objective if you can understand from that latter well
    you know that that there was a ladder rungs from you know your boss all the way

    bit to understand that you that''s probably the single most important document
    of your entire career U. sensually have eighteen lines to summarize what you''ve
    done in a year to show like the good work that you''re doing and how you''re impacting
    mission readiness is so I wish I''d known earlier the kind of things that it takes
    to actually write a good evaluation because not only would it help me out personally
    but then as you move up as a leader your sensually writing those evaluations on
    your people if your horrible it at eve all writing then your people are gonna
    suffer they could be doing the best work across the board but if you can''t put
    that down in paper and quantify that in eighteen lines are less than your folks
    are gonna get overlooked for promotions so you know ask early on how do I write
    a good even I''ll and what do I need to do to write those evaluations to meet
    what''s being looked at '

    leadership and ask them what their expectations are of you and what they want
    to see happen not within just your individual division or platoon or department
    but for the command as a whole so you got to really understand what those goals

    doing a variety of different things is probably just that time away from my family
    there are there it I''ve I''ve missed both of my kids being born because of training
    or deployment in so those are things you can never get back and so that''s probably
    been the most challenging for me is that time away even though I do have an understanding
    family wife who''s can can operate independently and two kids now that are in
    high school and are able to kind of work on their own they don''t necessarily
    need me around all the time I still want to be there to see them you know grass
    and succeed in and help out and do the fatherly thing but they also understand
    that that''s not always going to be the case work in a line of work that we do
    so but that doesn''t mean to me is it still was a personal challenge was was being

    of integrity is as cliche as it sounds we hear it coming to boot camp all throughout
    your career you have to have that integrity but it''s true and that''s why it''s
    brought up because if you can have that self integrity to to make sure that you''re
    doing what needs to be done regardless of the situation regardless who''s around
    then internally that''s going to reflect on the people you''re gonna lead and
    they''re gonna want Amir that and model your behavior as well as the folks that
    are your leadership are going to notice that you have that integrity and that
    it''s kind of being reflected within the folks that you''re leading which in turn
    they''re gonna be able to trust you with more responsibilities and probably give
    you a lot more flexibility as well because I understand that this isn''t this
    individual has a lot of integrity folks there leading have a lot of integrity
    we can trust that person as well as that department or division that they''re
    leading to get this job done without a lot of micro management or oversight so
    again as cliche as it sounds you know it I think integrity is probably that most
    important aspect '

    in and you know the guys are already in the platoon space like you''re the new
    check and I said yeah absolutely I like great we''re going out to see real quick
    so here throw this on and come down out of the boat and we''re gonna go out and
    work these animals and now I''m standing there with my packet of papers in my
    dress whites on and they throw me like some smelly fish smelling close we''re
    shorts and a brown T. shirt they found like a pair of boots that I could wear
    and within ten minutes from from checking in in my dress whites I''m wearing you

    on board that we''re gonna go work for the day having them dive down to like five

    we got back there like all right go head to shower up now you go upstairs and
    check into admin and get your other stuff ready to go and finish the check in
    process I think that was kind of a unique experiences kind of unconventional from
    what I heard of how you normally check in when you show up to a new command in
    the navy I actually enjoyed it that way looking back on it because it really got
    an opportunity for me to immediately understand what I was going to be doing to
    talk with the folks that we''re gonna be leading me in the folks I was gonna be
    working with in kind of a on formal setting and then you step back into the formal
    setting put on my dress whites then go and finish the check in process I think
    that''s kind of a unique experience the the for the navy in a cultural experience
    that were very C. driven were very work driven and so new guy shows up it''s me
    like Hey we''re going out on the water to go do some work and then you can worry

    for example the dolphins back in Vietnam were actually brought there and we''re
    doing anti swimmer anti diver defense and cam Ranh bay and then the sea lions
    came online when they discovered that it was a lot more faster and effective to
    use the C. lines that can dive down to several hundred feet of depth to recover
    training minds as opposed to sending down a diver who could take you know hours
    to get down to a depth of that hook up and then come back to the surface so the
    navy''s been using marine mammals since then to basically conduct you know mine
    countermeasures as well as anti swimmer and diver defense and they still continue
    to have them even though we are moving forward with advanced technology the marine
    mammal systems are still an option for the navy to use '

    understand what they are first why were they put in place the reason behind that

    written so you really really need to fully understand what the rules are before
    you start to try and break or bend them and then when you do decide that like
    you need to step outside the black and white start operating the gray you know
    what is the risk versus reward am I gonna cause damage to personnel or equipment
    am I willing to accept that risk is that gonna cause detriment to the mission
    overall if you find that you know those none of those apply and that in order
    for you to get to your objective because you''re working in kind of this no man''s
    land and it requires you to break the rules then go forward with it obviously
    you know try and get authorization first but if you happen to be in a situation

    decision after you''ve done a quick thought analysis and decided that I need to

    that kind of prevented them from getting the maps on time for them to conduct
    the physical and then eventually signed the contract and come into the delayed
    entry program I had to explain to the rest of my team including the supervisor
    at the time that this individual just is not ready to go over there because they''re
    having some significant personal issues which I discussed with them however the
    team still felt that those were things that we could work around that individual
    could still go on the day that we had decided so that they can come in and join
    and be marked off as a as accounting contract I kind of stood by what I needed
    to do and and protected that individual I got a lot of Flack for it however the
    following week note after all the stuff it subsided we were able to get that individual
    in the contract still counted for the for the month which is what we''re looking
    for we had a particular goal we had to achieve that month but you know we were

    I was leading and how to handle that situation was when it came to working hours
    so I had just moved into a new command I''d taken leadership of this new division
    they were all instructors and prior to their previous leader their you know their
    major focus was time off like they were under the impression that this you shore
    duty is supposed to work as less as possible and they really didn''t care about
    how other people''s careers were progressing so I came into that situation and
    realize that more than half of those individuals in there were still lacking on
    certain qualifications or certain milestones that they should have already hit
    having been at that command for as long as they had and so I kind of put out that
    listen we know things are gonna change a little bit this time of you getting out
    of here by noon every day since you don''t have a class in session you know is
    going away until you can show me that you''ve achieved this particular qualifications
    that your least working towards it and making an admirable effort no working hours
    are gonna be what''s set by the commanding officer as eight to four and we got
    into a pre heated discussion in an argument about that there''s people that were
    very adamant that thing shouldn''t change we should be able to do what we want
    to do and leave when we need to and I tried to explain to them that listen in
    the long run you know you''re probably gonna thank me for this even after you
    leave the commander not gonna quite understand what I''m getting at but understand
    that there is a method to my madness and the whole point of that was that it not
    only is going to increase your personal and professional development it''s gonna
    enhance your career over also improving the commands mission readiness because
    the more people that we have qualified as say master training specialist and that''s
    going to improve our commands mission readiness we''re gonna have a lot more effective
    training that''s going to reciprocate down to the people that we are training
    here on a daily and weekly basis and then ultimately you''re gonna look back and
    be glad that you got this qualification because of the opportunities you''re gonna
    have not only in the service but when you get out and so after that he discussion
    eventually got the buy in people started to work on those qualifications they
    got them done and then we were able to go back to having kind of a you know flexible
    working hours because everyone was where they needed to be with their milestones
    in qualifications but it was incredible challenging it tested my fortitude on
    being very direct and not budging on with the rest of the group wanted to do which
    was you know maintain the status quo '

    working with the E. U. D. community and conducting mine countermeasures and we''re
    working in austere environments around the world operating from small boats in
    all varying types of C. state are sometimes with little to no oversight with maybe
    only the protection that we have with us in that small boat working around explosives
    or having to find certain mines you know working in a in a mine field or even
    near mine field is just risky in an inherent danger just that alone you know also
    it being a diver you know I''m dealing with the risks that you intend you and
    you feel with diving whether it''s cold water and the different gas laws and coming
    up too fast for sending in those kind of different things so a lot of different
    risk that we deal with as a job and do decide as a leader you know the risks that
    you''re going to deal with is far as you know careers that you''re working with
    their their personal professional development are you steering that individual
    in the right way or you providing them the right advice you know there there''s
    a risk in that his name they''re gonna be taking what you say as as attentional
    gospel and truth and you could possibly be staring them down the wrong path that
    has the make a wrong decision and it falls back on you and so there is that risk
    that you''re dealing with is you could possibly be jeopardizing other people''s
    careers or livelihood for that matter so those are the things you gotta considering

    an H. T. does and so I''ve had a challenge with with progressing in making rank
    because I''m view it is not working in rate doing on conventional work is an H.
    T. even though I kind of disagree with that that thought process because I am
    filling the role or the billet of NH T. it just so happens that it''s not traditional
    H. T. work so somewhere somebody in the navy felt that an H. T. needs to be doing
    this and so that''s what I''m doing and the way that I''ve overcome that is just
    continually to perform in whatever duty I''ve been given so you know if there''s
    certain qualifications that I need to have I''d I get those and I and I and I
    totally understand them and then I also help other people get them so you have

    my career you originally came in to be see in the navy so after my initial a school
    training I went on to their basic underwater demolition school our buds where
    I was there for a couple months and then got to basically the third night of hell
    week and I didn''t complete the program and so I''ve been or finished out of that
    hell week not completing it and and didn''t graduate from buds after that and
    I was pretty devastated because that had been an initial dream a passion of mine
    for a very long time from there I kind of lucked out and was able to get into
    the EOD community now doesn''t you D. technician but just working with the community
    as a marine mammal handler and I was still very young so I also noticed that my
    maturity level probably wasn''t right at that time when I was trying to go through
    to become a seal and also I was newly married I had a child already another one
    on the way and so in retrospect looking back necessarily wasn''t a bad decision
    of what happened and I actually learned a lot from that there''s a lot of things
    that I even learned in the time that I was there that I''ve used since I''ve been
    in as far as you know value and integrity and leadership skills that I''ve taken
    with me and so you are even being devastated after that failure you know it''s
    gonna happen you''re able to bounce back from that and just find the silver lining
    in everything and then find a good situation that you''re in and build on that

    still working on it at home late at night my family you know is always wondering
    why am up till ten eleven o''clock working on something like did I do that during
    the day while I was at work and so it really kind of takes away from that family
    time and that''s a huge weakness of mine that I have is just not being able to
    separate you know my work life style from my personal and family life and so I''ve
    been getting better at that I''ve actually made certain lakes stoppers where if
    I find myself at home working on something for work and it''s now approaching
    you know eight or nine o''clock at night and I''m still doing it I I will stop
    where I''m at and and discontinue that and pick it up on the next day as opposed

    that you don''t feel is a good fit is you first try maybe voice that to the people
    that are signing you that that you know it''s not something that you think you
    can do or that you want to be in perhaps they can get a change but if you don''t
    tell anyone about it or at least tell the right people and nothing''s going to
    happen if you''re still kind of stuck in that position then you need to try and
    find out why am I here there''s gotta be a particular reason what is the bigger

    purpose is the bigger picture of it and then you know of it and and go through
    and make the best of that situation '
