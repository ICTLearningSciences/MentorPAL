    interesting ways to approach a problem and come to a new solution as opposed to
    everyone that has that groupthink mentality. So, you know, that's my ideal team
    is everyone that can think individually but be working towards that common group

    layer between you and them and opening up that dialogue. They shouldn't be able
    or they shouldn't be afraid to come to you to ask questions. Whether that's, you
    know, you have an open door policy or there's a particular time that they know
    they can come to talk to you. When they do do that, you're intently listening
    and you're building that open dialogue and communication, which in turn is gonna
    improve and build their trust with you as their leader.

    to know them, you know, on a personal level besides just professional. So you
    know, if you know what kind of Moz them professionally, that's great. You can
    help drive drive their career in that path. But then, if you kind of know what
    they're into personally, that's gonna allow you to build those kind of connections
    that will allow them to open up to you when you communicate, build those kind
    of trust relationships because you know about their family and their wife or husband
    or significant other, their kids or their dog or where they grew up, What they're
    even just their first name is how, when they graduate high school, did they graduate
    high school, these different kind of things I don't necessarily see that is intrusive
    leadership. If you do it in the right way, you're not necessarily being intrusive.
    You're just getting to know your people, which in turn is gonna build communication
    and build trust

  transcript: ways that you can build trust between your team members is by trying
    to do team events that make every individual rely on each other and as the team
    as a whole. So try and come up with, you know, different ideas, solutions, exercises,
    go out and do team events to build that camaraderie, that unit cohesion between
    your team. Not everyone's always gonna get along with everyone that they work
    with within their team or platoon or department, But they need to know that when
    it's it's time for work, it's time for mission that they all can trust one another.
    And the best way to do that is through some unit cohesion building, you know,
    examples or exercises. And a lot of times adversity really builds that trust is
    well, and you can put a team through something that is that everyone had to deal
    with, which was a very stressful situation. People come out of that with the same
    kind of mutual understanding because they all experienced that same stressful
    situation, and that's gonna build some trust amongst your team members in the
    team as a whole

    If it if it doesn't need to be there and it's just you and I in a personal setting,
    then we don't need to have all that pomp and circumstance when we're just trying

    and you're not necessarily going to get all the information that you need from

    First and foremost is obviously training, and you have to have that foresight
    ahead of time to know that it's gonna be a particular mission coming down the
    line and then training to that and stressing them as much as you possibly can
    in that training environment to prepare them for that tough mission ahead. So
    that way, the first time that they're experiencing some of that toughness, you
    know, isn't during when that mission is happening. But they will actually already
    experienced that during training situations and scenarios, because that's where
    you can apply. Um, fixes when you start noticing some of those deficiencies and
    building that mental tenacity. And when that mental tenacity is built, then you
    also start to see that physical tenacity come out and they'll be ready for those
    tough missions. So training ahead of time and training and stressful environment
    that's gonna get you prepared for those tough missions

    share personal stories or emotions with your team. I think it is dependent on,
    uh, what's going on, the situation at hand in the environment that you're in.
    Ah, a lot of times it makes sense to share very personal stories because then
    people can relate to you a little bit more. They understand that, um, you're very
    similar to them. You might even have a very similar story that they have, which
    creates that relationship and builds that trust and communication on then other
    times to pay upon the situation or where you're at you might not want to share
    personal stories or show very much emotion. So it's really something that you
    just kind of have to gauge where you're at in the environment that you're in and
    the people that you're working with, when's the right time to be emotional wins
    the right time to be a little more formal in those kind of things

    listen and you listen well and kind of ask probing questions to get behind that
    need or get behind. You know what that surface value is because there's always
    something underlying there. That's something you want to try and get to. The only

  transcript: are having. If your team is having trouble meeting standards on, you
    need to try and get them there. There's different things that you can do when
    the first things that I recommend is, you know, taking a pause, taking a step
    back and reassess what's going on. Is there something that you're missing as a
    leader that maybe isn't necessarily coming down to their level to help them make
    that mission achievement? Is there something going on personally in their life
    that you're not aware of? That has them, you know, not fully engage? Well, they're
    at work to make that mission accomplishment. You might find that after you talk
    with them that there is something going on personal and they're unable to focus.
    And so that was the issue. And so you can try and help them resolve that issue
    or get them to the people that can help them resolve that in that wayto hope,
    hopefully bring them back online and get them focused again. If you've kind of
    tried all that and you're basically at your wits and you really don't know what
    to do, obviously need to communicate that on up and say, Listen here the steps
    that I've taken to try and help my team make this mission successful or meet mission
    objectives. And we're just missing it. Tried A, B, C, D and E and, well, you know,
    here's what we've done here is the relevant proof that we're making the best attempt.
    It's just it's not achievable based on the situation that we have or the equipment
    or even the people that I have. We're unable to make that you have to communicate

    in line to maybe help bring that team. Or maybe they reassess what they're asking
    you to do and realize that that actually is unachievable on where it's a big ask
    and nobody looked at it that way. And now that you've tried everything, you've
    put out several courses of action and you've tried all of those and they're not
    working. Maybe we need to reassess what's going on, so you might find that's helpful.
    Um, if it is achievable and you've just tried everything, um, than the next piece
    is, maybe you start to do a little bit of a counseling session with. If it is
    a particular individual and you've tried everything, you might have to do some
    counselling with them.

  transcript: there was so many different ways in the Navy that you can reward your
    sailors for good performance. What you first have to do is just figure out what
    motivates your people, because what motivates one person is going to be different
    from somebody else. If I've got somebody who's been performing really well and
    I know that they, uh, enjoy time off, then that might be. What I reward them with
    is an extra day off. We're going home earlier. Something like that. If I've got
    another individual who doesn't really care about time off because they're really
    driven and just like toe work and perform, maybe I actually give him more responsibility,
    because that's what they have been seeking. They want to show that they're capable
    of taking on more. So I give them that might have other individuals that are really,
    you know, looking for that kind of award or credit or something. So put him in
    for the award s o. You have to really just understand what drives and motivates
    each one of those individuals and then, you know, work towards that whenever they're
    doing good things. But always let your people know when they're doing something
    good. You know, even just that, that subtle in the middle of the day. Hey, you're
    really doing You know, I appreciate what you're doing. Or that looks great. Even
    just that single comment when they've been working hard like that looks great.
    Er, you're really doing well there. That might be enough to continue to push them
    on to finish that evolution.

    is Ah is their ability to be kind of freethinkers outside the box thinkers innovative
    and adaptive. Those are the things that not only were looking for in the community,
    but in Navy and the forces a hole. We need more individuals to kind of think outside
    the box. So that's the first thing that I'm kind of looking for us. Is this person
    able to act independently because if they're able to act independently, then that
    means that's less work that I have to be doing with them all the time. And I can
    focus my efforts on other things that maybe need my attention as opposed to them.
    So that would be one of kind of the first things that I'm looking for on then
    also just their ability to fit into the team. So not only do they need to be,
    you know, kind of a good cognisant individual, but do they play well and are they
    going to give us a good build for the team as well?

    a team be a better teammate, is ah, is improving your level of communication,
    not just how you are able to get your responses across, but also just listening
    to others. And you really have to listen. A lot of times people, when they're
    being talked to, they're in their own minds, kind of thinking what they already
    want to say to that question or what their response is gonna be. And when you
    do that, you really aren't fully listening to what the other person is saying
    because you're more inside your own head trying to kind of figure out what you're
    going to say next. Um and you can miss a lot. So one of things you could do with
    your interpersonal communication skills is just truly listen like don't be in
    your own head trying to figure out what you're going to say next. But listen to
    what's being said. And if you have to take a moment to pause and then start thinking
    that's okay, because then you fully listen to what those other teammates had to
    say. You're going provide a much better response to that question or the overall

    Military. A lot of times that's very cut and dry on what you you can do with them
    and your leadership styles, how you can award them and reward them as well as
    what you can do with them punitively. Ah, when you start dealing with civilians,
    there's certain lines that you just can't cross. Ah, that you might have to understand
    what their actual statement of work is and where their lateral lines and limits
    are, because what you think you could ask a military person to do they will be
    able to do. But a particular civilian, whether government employee or contractor,
    is pretty much limited to what their statement of work says that they can dio.
    If you start asking them to do things out of that scope, you can get them in trouble.
    You can get yourself in trouble so you really gotta understand. You know what
    their limits are and then work around that and understand that you can't necessarily
    hold them to the same punitive standard as you could. A military member, But they
    also do have their avenues to where Let's say you do have a civilian employee
    who is not meeting. The standard is becoming difficult. Obviously, you can't discipline
    them yourself. You might have to go directly to their supervisor or the the contract
    supervisor, whoever their program manager is and begin to have that dialogue and

  transcript: My first major leadership role was when I became a chief petty officer
    and moved in to become the unmanned underwater vehicles leading chief petty officers.
    So I essentially was in charge of 11 other sailors. And as we combined to create
    a platoon, we deployed numerous times to Fifth Fleet and other areas of that operation,
    conducting unmanned underwater vehicle work, looking for mines and conducting
    mine countermeasures. So as the LCP oh, I was in charge of those 11 other sailors,
    personal professional development and making sure that we could also accomplish
    the mission.

    flying at the same time. So usually my work weeks can consist of working from
    eight in the morning till sometimes 10 at night. I do take my work home with me
    a lot of time. So if I'm here training personnel from early in the morning till
    45 o'clock in the afternoon, there's stuff I still need to get accomplished. I'll
    take that home and work on it. So on average, you know, I'm working anywhere between
    10 and 12 hours a day at a minimum.

    there's times that I have to deal with the sailors personal and professional development.
    For example, a sailor might come in and say that he has. He's having family issues
    or needs to get his wife's car registered. How does he go about doing that? So
    I gotta help him out with that A piece of work then Other times I might be getting
    tasking from our Commodore, even our admiral, a TyCom that's wanting to see where
    we're moving forward with developing certain programs for the U. D community,
    especially the X m, c m community and mine countermeasures. So it varies from

  transcript: "So one story that I can think of that really shows what it's like working\
    \ in my job is Ah is a story that kind of has to do with innovation and outside\
    \ the box thinking, which we commonly have to do in the e o. D. Community here.\
    \ Ah, one of which was we had a particular piece of gear, one of our U. U V s,\
    \ which is about 12 feet in length and weighs about \xA3600 and it's really been\
    \ tied to launch in recovering from an 11 meter rib and these 11 meter ribs, you\
    \ can only move them in theatre from one place to another, based on particular\
    \ air strategic lift requirements that air there. It's very difficult to kind\
    \ of get aircraft that you can fit in 11 meter rib inside. So we thought outside\
    \ the box and figured, How can we move this piece of equipment using the most\
    \ smallest platform that we have in our arsenal, which is a very small combat\
    \ rubber rating craft or creek? So this was out on deployment and we've found\
    \ kind of a construction site that had some leftover plywood and foam, and we\
    \ basically developed a sled device that we were able to pull this vehicle up\
    \ onto and tow behind our smallest platform, our smallest creek that had just\
    \ a 35 horsepower engine and still be able to be combat effective and deploy the\
    \ equipment searching for mines all across the theater. So from that our admiral\
    \ happened, actually see what we had developed out of wood and foam, and it kind\
    \ of got nicknamed the Spruce Goose, and later he actually funded a program to\
    \ develop a more robust prototype. And here we are. Five years later, we actually\
    \ have 18 of these operational prototypes being worked. Right now, they've gone\
    \ through several different generations, and they're now part of the X m. C. M\
    \ Cos tore table of allowances. And they deploy with these things that provide\
    \ us an opportunity to basically get to where we need to without being strongarm\
    \ to using the 11 meter rib"

  transcript: So one of the major benefits my job. What I think is great about it
    is just the diversity that you experience every single day. It's really not the
    same thing every single day. You're given many opportunities to kind of think
    on your own and be responsible. Even our most junior personnel, at a very early
    start in their career, are given tremendous responsibility where that's leading
    personnel or they're responsible for multimillion dollar worth of equipment. I
    don't think you can really find that in many other places, not even within the
    Navy, at some points as well as in the civilian world. I mean, what civilian job
    do you know is going to give an 18 year old the ability to make critical decisions
    as well as being charge of millions of dollars worth of gear? That is gonna potentially
    cause impact or threat to not only friendly forces but to our enemy forces. So
    that's kind of one of the biggest benefits of working in this community is the
    fact that you're really given a lot of freedom and leeway and looked at as an
    intellectual adult who's able to make decisions and move the ball forward for
    progressing the force in the community

  transcript: So I guess what could be considered a major negative is the fact that
    you do work kind of long hours in this job and community, and there's nothing
    really defined. Some days I come in and I work till noon. I can go home. There's
    other times where I don't know when I'm gonna be able to go home. Um, so that
    can kind of be looked at as a negative for me. I still kind of considered a bit
    of a positive because it isn't repetitive. It's something different all the time
    and were given that opportunity to kind of flex and use our own intuition on what
    we consider a work day or needs to be done. So are ours aren't that stringent?
    But it's really left up to the individual, the platoon and the team to decide
    how they're gonna work and when they wanna work. But we do work long hours that
    aren't necessarily on the schedule all the time.

    people are given credit or kudos for things that they might not necessarily do
    all the time on a daily basis. And so you know, not everybody in the Navy and
    not everybody, even in this community, is an operator, a shooter, and is going
    down range, you know, creating havoc to the faux face to face. You know, there
    are other people out there that they're they're doing a lot of good work in the
    logistical side and the supporting side, or they're also considered enablers that
    allow those real special operators to go and do their work. But you know, those
    enablers don't necessarily get the credit that they're do where they get looked
    at inappropriately. And, oh, you're in that community. So you must do this. We
    necessarily they don't. So I think that might be something that gets romanticized
    a lot about. But a lot of people don't really understand what goes behind making
    good operations work, and it's those people that do that

    doing is originally joined the Navy to come in to be a Navy SEAL. And during that
    time, you actually had to pick a source rating before you could go on to seal
    training. So I asked, Ah, the detailer that was there at maps, you know, what's
    the shortest a school you have? Because I have no intention on doing it. And he
    said, Hey, all maintenance technician. So I asked, What's that? Oh, it's welding.
    Okay, Yeah, Give it to me. I'll do that short school. So went through boot camp,
    went on in my following a school for home maintenance technician and welding,
    and then went on to buds where I didn't make it all the way through the program.
    So I ended up having to become a whole maintenance technician where I ended up.
    Actually, moving on to E. O. D. Is my first command and doing marine mammal handling
    and working in that aspect and because of the job that I had done initially with
    E o. D. Have actually been managed to maintain an entire career within this community,
    and never really have actually worked within the whole maintenance tech jobs.
    So, you know, originally came in to be a seal and then haul maintenance technician
    is a secondary platform. And now here I am senior chief in the Navy that actually
    uses unmanned underwater vehicles to do mine countermeasures for the Navy as a
    whole.

  transcript: So with in my career, I've had to move several times. Andi, it did incur
    some changes for that personally, with my family and those kind of things, I've
    had to move from the West Coast to the East Coast, back to the West Coast again
    when I've made deployments that I'm actually going out of country for 6 to 7 months
    at a time. And, uh, that kind of takes a toll on you personally as well as what
    you have to deal with with your family. So, um, I've been able to move my family
    to live back home with family and friends. There is a support unit when I've been
    on deployments on then, of course, moving back and forth from coast to coast.
    I have a tendency to where I will go out first and kind of establish that residency
    and get over. Our household goods moved in and everything set up before I finally
    move. My wife and kids out toe toe live in that home. So it's a more easier transition
    for them to dio, and I kind of take on all the heavy lifting in that aspect.

    now. I'm at a point in my career where I've got 18 years in, Um, the command that
    I'm currently at can actually take me to 21 years, and I could essentially retire
    from here, but because I enjoy the work that I'm doing so much, and as long as
    the opportunity presents itself, I'm not opposed to re enlisting again and continue
    to make a career of this And whether I do another five years or try and push it
    out to 30 and retire there, um, I'm not sure it really is gonna kind of present
    itself to me in the next year or two On what I decide. Because of the work that
    I've done in the Navy, I've got a tremendous opportunities on the outside, on
    the civilian sector and even in the government sector where I could find work
    and do that. But I am kind of enjoy what I'm doing here and the security that
    there is with being in the Navy, so I might prolong and extend in as well

  transcript: So what I think makes a good leader is somebody who is also a good listener.
    In order for you to lead your people effectively, you also have to be able to
    understand and listen to what your people's needs are and understand what mission
    requirements are. You can't just automatically jump in immediately. Try and take
    hold of something and lead it from the get go, or else you're not gonna get any
    buy in from the personnel that you're trying to lead. So it's best to get together
    with them first and kind of understand what their challenges are, what their strengths
    are and then build from that and then not allow you to lead that entire group
    forward. So Choi is making a positive impact for the command, and the Navy is
    a hole.

  transcript: So I think the first steps that when you have a new leadership position,
    is obviously getting to understand your people first and understanding what their
    strengths and weaknesses are and how you can use those to progress not only their
    personal and professional development for but the group is a hole as long as the
    group is moving forward than that in turn is gonna allow the commands mission
    to move forward and increased mission readiness, which will then move the entire
    Navy's mission forward as well. And if every command is doing that, then the entire
    projection of the Navy is gonna be in a more positive direction. So you can see
    where that starts with the very most junior person and understanding what their
    strengths are and promoting those type of attributes and how that then rolls into
    the platoon or division or department that you work in and strengthens that entire
    organization. And then that, in turn and strengthens the command, moves on towards
    the rest of the fleet and then in turn, the Navy as a whole. So I think, you know,
    um, the very first steps is understanding what your junior personnel on the personal.
    It's your leading, whether they're junior or your peers or what have you, what
    their strengths and weaknesses are and what their direction, what influences them.

    or divisions and even departments that I've led is one as kind of Ah is very open
    and fluid. I enjoyed a have, you know, face to face conversations with individuals.
    My door's always left open. Anyone that works with me understands that they can
    come in and talk to me at any time, and we'll hash it out. If for some reason
    I can't really give them land divided attention at that moment, we'll set up another
    time to do that. But then when we do talk, it's very candid. I like to try and
    break down that hierarchy structure where, you know, maybe they see me as their
    leader chief, and they might just be the E three. I like to get very personal
    because that way the individual feels like they can open up more as opposed to
    trying to be a little stifled because they see this or you know, the chief from
    your lurking over them. And that's not necessarily the best wayto kind of open
    up that dialogue, and then when you open up that dialogue and you begin to understand
    what makes these people tick, then you can kind of help develop and guide their
    path and career into the direction that it needs to be with with their buying.

    a mistake is a challenge to kind of overcome is not really understanding your
    people to the full intent as well. Is not understanding what your mission is in
    your requirements for that mission? Um, something that was asked to me one time
    when I was sitting on and eso que board years ago was you know what is more important,
    the mission or your people? And at the time I had said, Well, my people are the
    most important thing. And then afterwards one of the board members pulled me aside
    and he said, No, your mission is always a single most important aspect to everything
    because without understanding the mission and what that priority is, and you can't
    really understand how to prioritize your people and take care of them, and so
    you need to really understand the mission. If you don't need to get out and read
    what your commander's intent is, what their guiding principles, mission and vision
    are, understand that and how you fit into that overall piece. And then once you
    understand that you can then direct the folks that you lead into accomplishing
    that. And once they know where they fit in and the overall spoke and how they
    can play a part in that big wheel and you'll notice that they're going to make
    everything move forward and everything kind of just will run seamlessly. So, you
    know, without fully understanding your mission and without fully understanding
    your people, that is gonna put you out of hurdle and it's really hard. It's really
    something hard to recover from.

    your shortfalls are in your resource is that's gonna play a part in what your
    overall mission success is as well as gonna play a part in the mission success
    of your personnel that you're leading. If you're missing those of those resource

    things kind of take time, even if I under even if identify a shortfall right now
    in my resource is it could take anywhere from 36 months a year longer until maybe
    I see something back from that shortfall. So if identify that early now, then
    hopefully that will catch up to when I actually needed and having those resource

  transcript: So how much leadership should you take on if you're coming in to say
    that that first leadership position is a petty officer, probably the lpo. The
    first thing you want to do is establish those expectations between your L CPO
    and whoever you're. All I see is, you know, what are their expectations of you
    as now the lpo, the person who's really down there every day dealing with sailors
    face to face, who probably knows more intimately about There are things that are
    going on, you know, they're the command as well as behind the scenes, you know,
    So you need to get with your leadership and understand. Okay, what are your expectations
    is the lpo, and then also let them know what your expectations are As them is
    your leaders, they're not going to be able to provide good service to you or the
    folks that you're leading as an L. P O. If you don't provide them what it is you're
    looking for, and as a leader, you've got to be able t talk to those that are in
    charge of you and ask them what their expectations are as well as what you expect
    of them as your leadership. You can't be afraid to do that. That's one of those
    challenges now that you're a leader is t Go out and talk to those folks that that
    are your superiors and kind of give them your expectations as well. And I think
    that kind of opens up that dialogue and provides that cross. You know, that that
    flat line of communication. So that way, everybody is kind of running on the same
    gear.

  transcript: so one way that you can, um you build that camaraderie with your team
    without, you know, cutting close that Fratton ization line. Um, it's a challenge,
    to say the least, right? It really depends on communities as well. It varies across
    the board. Some communities are on first name basis with their folks throughout
    the entire triad, where other communities is very formal and you address them
    by their title and last name or just title only. So what you have to do is you
    first gotta figure out what kind of community or you in and what are the community
    norms and then work to those you know, if you're in a more informal community,
    you could kind of be looked at in Ostracised is an outsider if you are too formal.
    If you are in a community where things are no formal and you are becoming a little
    more informal again, it works that same way. People are gonna look at you a little
    bit different, not take you seriously, and it's gonna jeopardize your role as
    a leader. So you got a first kind of figure out what community in my end, and
    then once you're in that, you know, play to those community norms, but also make
    sure that the folks that you're leading still understand where that leadership
    line lays. So sure, you might work side by side with your people. I've even on
    certain employments. I live in the same Ah, how's the same tent establishment
    with my E three? And I was the senior chief, you know, we all live together in
    the same community, but there still was that that line that he still knew ultimately
    that I was I was the leader in charge. But we did have, you know, informal style
    discussions. And talking together is a platoon. So it's It's a challenge to say.
    I think the first thing is you got to figure out what kind of community and you
    are in and what are those community norms and then work to that

    know? Yes, I did understand the bigger picture and working towards that common
    goal for the entire platoon, the command and the Navy as a whole, but also is
    still very concerned about my own personal and professional development and growth,
    you know? Can I get on this school? Can I make this trip? Can I go to this deployment?
    Can I, you know, get to this next command or get stationed here is very, you know,
    self centric, working for myself and the benefits of my family as you move up
    in leadership. And as I moved up in leadership, you know, you no longer are supposed
    to be kind of really worrying about yourself, But you need to really start taking
    care of the folks that you're leading and doing good by them and trying to progress
    their careers and improving their personal and professional development. So as
    you move up in your leadership role, you need to become more selfless than you

  transcript: my view of the line of work that I've done and how it's changed over
    time is that is becoming more relevant now than probably It was even five years
    ago, especially 10 15 years ago. So, for example, the line work that I was doing
    we used to use marine mammals to try and find, you know, unexploded ordinance,
    their minds under the water. And now we've moved forward to using unmanned underwater
    vehicles to do this line of work. So what that does is it reduces the risk to
    personnel because you're not having to put essentially people within a minefield
    or or animals in a minefield to find these things. They could be miles away. And
    you're still using equipment to do that, as well as its hoping to reduce that
    timeline that we have in mine countermeasures. So as you know, things change as
    technology changes and also to I've noticed that the Navy and Department of Defense
    as a whole is starting to buy off on this entire you know, you you ve or unmanned
    systems realm. You can see everywhere from the president's national security strategy
    on down to the national defense strategy to our CEO knows maritime for superiority.
    You know, one point, Owen. Even 2.0, documentation. All the overarching instructions
    that govern what we do is a Department of Defense. And as a naval forces, a hole
    is really starting to buy off on unmanned systems and moving forward in that direction
    because they realize that it can exponentially do more work than we can with people
    as well as it also is reducing risk to personnel, which is a good thing. So those
    were kind of some of things I've seen. Change when the technology has changed
    is that unmanned systems is becoming more relevant and what we do day to day throughout
    department defense as a whole.

  transcript: so the priorities that I'd recommend for you if you're entering into
    a leadership position is read. You have to read a lot of things you need to read.
    You know what your commanders, guidance, mission, vision and intent is and then
    understand what his boss's intent is, you know, so that your Essex has their own,
    you know, guidance and mission and vision statement, and then continue to just
    trying to trickle up the line from his to your tight coms to then how that fits
    into the CIA knows objective to the secretary of Defense's objective to then the
    president's objective. If you can understand from that ladder, well, you know
    that was ladder rungs from you know, your boss all the way up to the president
    and understand how you fit into that as a leader. Then not only is gonna make
    you more effective in your own dated a job, but then you'll be able to effectively
    lead your people to accomplish those objectives that from the top all the way
    down have, um, and so you'll always be moving in the right direction and getting
    those those bigger objectives accomplished because you know how you fit into the
    overarching scheme of things. So that is probably my number. One recommendation
    for a priority is just get in there and read your commander's intent and guidance
    all the way up.

  transcript: certain skills that I wish that I had mastered before I had started,
    um, was probably administrative skills. So, you know, earlier on in my career
    I was very good at the technical aspect and the operating aspect. It wasn't until
    I really moved on to recruiting duty where I really I had a hard look at my administrative
    skills because at that time we still kind of hand wrote contracts out and there
    was a lot of pages with that. And if you made a single clerical error, you had
    to kind of start all over again with the paperwork. And so doing four years of
    recruiting duty will definitely make you a lot better at your administrative side.
    And so I wish I had kind of had known that earlier on, because it would have saved
    me a lot of late nights and a lot of do overs with paperwork and things like that,
    as I have moved on to having to be more strata administratively sound as I moved
    up in leadership positions and my career is a hole

  transcript: one question that I wish I had asked earlier in my career was just how
    to properly do an evil how to write and evil. Um, you know, it took me a little
    bit to understand that that's probably the single most important document of your
    entire career. You essentially have 18 lines to summarize what you've done in
    a year to show, like the good work that you're doing and how you're impacting
    mission readiness. And so I wish that I had known earlier the kind of things that
    it takes to actually write a good evaluation, because not only would it help me
    out personally, but then, as you move up a za leader, you essentially writing
    those evaluations on your people. If you're horrible at evil writing than your
    people are going to suffer, they could be doing the best work across the board.
    But if you can't put that down on paper and quantify that in 18 lines or less
    than your folks are gonna get overlooked for promotions, so you know, ask early
    on, how do I write a good evil? And what do I need to do to write those evaluations
    to meet what's being looked at

  transcript: as a leader, you should start understanding. You know what those bigger
    goals are, As opposed to just working on something, you know, at the at the more
    subordinate levels. So sometimes you might have to go out of your way to find
    out what those overarching goals are. I need to ask those questions. You need
    to go to your leadership and ask them what their expectations are of you and what
    they want to see happen. Not within just your individual division or platoon,
    a department, but for the command as a whole s o. You got to really understand
    what those goals are. Not always Is someone gonna force feed that to you might
    have to go out of your way to find out what are my commands goals and how can
    I effectively make an impact in those goals or what are some deficiencies that

    and turned them from something negative into positive and move in that direction?

  transcript: something that was probably most challenging for me and my training.
    And I've had a lot of training in a variety of different places around the world,
    doing a variety of different things. It's probably just that time away from my
    family. Um, you know, I missed both of my kids being born because of training
    or a deployment. Um, and so those are things you can never get back, And so that's
    probably been the most challenging for me. Is that time away? Even though I do
    have an understanding family wife who's can can operate independently and two
    kids now that air in high school and are able to kind of work on their own, they
    don't necessarily need me around all the time. Um, I still want to be there to
    see them, you know, progress and succeed and help out and do the fatherly thing.
    But they also understand that that's not always gonna be the case working in the
    line of work that we do so. But that doesn't mean to me. It still was. A personal
    challenge was being away from family during during training or deployments

  transcript: so, you know, in order lead honorably. You've gotta have that. That
    that word of integrity is as cliche as it sounds that we hear it coming into boot
    camp all throughout your career. You have to have that integrity. But it's true.
    And that's why it's brought up. Because if you can have that self integrity to
    make sure that you're doing what needs to be done, regardless of the situation,
    regardless who's around, then internally, that's going to reflect on the people
    you're gonna lead. And they're gonna want a mere that and model your behavior
    as well as the folks that are your leadership are going to notice that you have
    that integrity and that it's kind of being reflected within the folks that you're
    leading, which in turn, they're gonna be able to trust you with more responsibilities
    and probably give you a lot more flexibility as well, because they understand
    that this isn't this individual has a lot of integrity, folks, that their leading
    have a lot of integrity. We can trust that person as well as that department or
    division that they're leading to get this job done without a lot of micromanagement
    or oversight. So again, as cliche as it sounds, you know, I think integrity is
    probably that most important aspect

    there that people have written hundreds of books on leadership. Um, you know,
    if if that's the kind of thing that you're into and you like reading those type
    of books, go on Thio your nearest book website, find out the top 10 and start
    reading those, Um, I also recommend that you understand what your leaderships,
    overarching guidance and principles are so that you could be in step with what
    they're trying to do. And so that goes from not only you know your CEO's intent
    and guidance, but his boss's boss and his boss's boss's boss all the way up to
    the highest levels. And so you you have to read those kind of documents and understand
    that structure, and that's gonna help you out and becoming a leader and making
    sure that at the very least, you're pointed in the right direction that your command
    and the Navy needs for you to be as your leading your subordinates.

    into my even my hometown newspaper was when I was a marine mammal when I was a
    marine mammal handler and were deployed the ball rain using the dolphins there,
    the U. S. So you know, they come in with celebrities all the time to do visits
    on base, and somehow they got win that there were Navy dolphins. They're in the
    area that we're trained to find enemies, swimmers and divers. And so they ended
    up setting up a meet and greet, um with some of the people that they brought through
    from the U. S. So so one of those individuals happen to be Ben Affleck who came
    down, and I basically showed him the dolphins that we worked with. I let him throw
    some fish to the Dolphins and actually do a couple of tricks. And, uh, there was
    a picture that was taken of Ben Affleck kind of kneeling down next to me is I'm
    handling this dolphin in front of them, and that got kind of distributed out to
    the Associated Press and was then, like, kind of published worldwide. on many
    newspapers from California all the way to Florida To the where, you know, even

    Ah, that was kind of Ah, fun, unique experience. And I ended up saving, like,
    a clip of that paper, and I still have it somewhere in a file or folder. But yeah,

  transcript: so a particular sea story that I can remember. It was actually when
    I first checked into, um ud mobile unit three, where I was gonna be doing marine
    mammal handling work. And so I showed up. You know, any four in my dress whites
    and I checked in, and, you know, the guys were already in the platoon space, like,
    Oh, you're the new checking I said, Yeah, absolutely. Like, Great. Um, we're going
    out to see real quick. So here, throw this on and come down out on the boat, and
    we're gonna go out and work these animals And, you know, I'm standing there with
    my packet of papers and my dress whites on, and they throw me like some smelly
    fish smelling close with shorts and a brown T shirt. They found, like, a pair
    of boots that I could wear and within 10 minutes from checking in, uh, in my dress
    whites I'm wearing, you know, the smelly outfit walking down to where the boats
    are at to get sea lions on board that we're gonna go work for the day having them
    dive down to, like, 500 feet, carrying a line to attach to training minds for
    training these animals. Um, so while we're out there, that's where they, the lpo
    and the other, the other folks around on the boat, you really start to get to
    kind of know me. Then we got back there like, All right, go ahead and just shower
    up. Now you go upstairs and check into admin and get your other stuff ready to
    go and finish your check in process. I think that was kind of a unique experience.
    There's kind of unconventional from what I heard of how you normally check in
    when you show up to a new command in the Navy. But I actually enjoyed it that
    way, looking back on it because it really got an opportunity for me to immediately
    understand what I was gonna be doing to talk with the folks that were gonna be
    leading me and the folks I was gonna be working with in kind of a un formal setting.
    And then, you know, step back into the formal setting, put on my dress whites
    and then go and finish the check in process. I think that's kind of a unique experience,
    uh, for the Navy and a cultural experience that were very sea driven were very
    work driven. And so new guy shows up. It's me like, Hey, we're going out on the
    water to go do some work and then you can worry about the administrative stuff
    afterwards.

    is get out of your own head. Um, you effective communication? There's a difference
    between a conversation and communication. No communication is being able to actually
    sit and listen to what the other person is saying without being in your own head,
    trying to figure out what you're going to say next. Because then you're gonna
    miss certain things that that person is telling you. So one step did you can do
    is if you find yourself when somebody is talking that you're in your own head,
    trying to figure out how you're going to continue to keep the conversation going
    or what you're gonna try and say next, Just stop. Stop, try and clear your mind
    and listen to what the person saying it also just be honest. A lot of times one
    waiting to get past your own personal flaws is to let other people know that you
    have those flaws and you can tell that individual you know what? I'm sorry. I
    was half listening to what you're saying. If you wouldn't mind, could you please
    repeat it so that I can I can hear you a little bit better and we can continue
    this conversation in this communication in a better light

    early seventies, where they were using dolphins and sea lions to conduct different
    operations. For example, the dolphin's back in Vietnam were actually brought there,
    and we're doing anti swimmer, anti diver defense in Cam Ranh Bay. Um, and then
    the sea lions came online when they discovered that it was a lot more faster and
    effective to use. These see lines that can dive down to several 100 feet of depth
    to recover training minds, as opposed to sending down a diver who could take,
    you know, hours to get down to a depth of that hook up and then come back to the
    surface. So the Navy's been using marine mammals since then to basically conduct,
    you know, mine countermeasures as well as, AH, anti swimmer and diver defense,
    and they still continue to have them. Even though we are moving forward with advanced
    technology, the marine mammal systems are still an option for the Navy to use

    know, a little, a little bit at a time. You know, I could be able to take the
    entire thing, walk right in and and know it all and be able to apply everything
    you've learned during that eight weeks school and think that you've got it. But
    if you look at every little piece and then try and do it systematically bit by
    bit, then you'll be able to really apply those lessons that you've learned on.
    And then you might find that some of the stuff that you learn those schools is
    kind of outdated, and the curriculum maybe hasn't been updated in a while, and
    so it no longer works that way but guaranteed. There's been some good golden nuggets
    that you've picked up at those schools that you can take and try and apply a little
    at a time until you fully grasp the concepts.

  transcript: one thing that you need to know about yourself to lead a team is what
    are your flaws and what your weaknesses are again. It's very easy to know what
    your strengths are. But if you don't know what your weaknesses aren't howto work
    on those and you're not gonna be able to improve yourself, which in turn you're
    not gonna be able to improve your team. Something that I have usually done is
    I'll sit down with the group as a whole after we've really developed, like a good
    relationship in a team culture. And I'll just ask the entire group, you know,
    No holds bar. Tell me like it is, where where am I failing you or how can I improve
    is your leader and actually get their opinion? You'd be surprised the kind of
    things that you thought that you were doing right, that you might be doing wrong
    in their eyes and then things that you thought were a weakness personally, that
    they actually consider a strength of that you're doing correctly. So you've got

    let them tell you that the emperor has no clothes and then take that criticism
    and work on it

    relatable to the folks that you're leading so that they have trust in you and
    that they feel that they can come to you and talk to you about situations that
    you'll value their opinion. Um, and don't be afraid Thio to do the dirty work

    go out and grab the broom yourself and help start sweeping. You'd be surprised

    sure that they hold themselves accountable. You've got to build a team that's
    capable of having thick skin, and that is able to take criticism. If you know
    you noticed that one of your teammates is doing something wrong or is messing
    up on something, you've gotta have the strength to tell them like, Hey, you're
    not doing this right And then they also gotta be able to take your criticism and
    not feel that you're attacking them. But you're only just trying to help them,
    which is ultimately going to try and help improve the team. So you've got a false
    foster that that culture within of accountability and having thick skin so that
    everyone can talk to one another because they ultimately know you're just trying
    to help them out as a teammate, which is ultimately gonna help the team, and that

    one way that you can improve that is making sure they all understand what their
    purpose is. You'll find a lot of times that people really don't know why they're
    doing what they're doing or why they're there. A simple way to find that out is
    just sit down with each person individually and ask them, Why are you here? Don't
    be condescending when you ask, obviously. But see if they actually understand
    what their purpose is. Why are they doing the job that they're doing? Why are
    they coming in every day from 9 to 5, working on this particular mission? Objective
    equipment. What have you and really peel that back? You'll find a lot of people
    really don't understand why they're doing what they're doing, and you got to keep
    kind of probing and don't take their first answer as the full one because it's
    more than likely gonna be superficial. You might have to actually educate them
    on why they're here and how they fit into the bigger picture. And once they really
    understand that, and why that they're why they're doing what they're doing and
    how they're actually part of, ah, larger goal. Then they're gonna have that buy
    in, and hopefully that will start improving the issues that you're having with
    some of those people.

    you know, certain, even if it's kind of Ah, documented. But undocumented doesn't
    necessarily have to be punitive. But if you can, you can mention like Listen,
    you hears certain things that I've seen on this particular day. There was this
    issue on this particular day. There was that and really show them what the kind
    of problems that you're having and then find out what's going on with them. There
    might be something personal that's happened in their life that you're unaware
    of. That's causing them to be unfocused. And maybe you can find that and help
    them resolve those issues. Um, or there's something else is going on that you're
    unaware of that you need to talk to them about. But the biggest thing is just
    that communication and having the strength to sit with that individual and let

  transcript: when is breaking the rules? Okay, um, it's kind of a loaded question,
    but so I think before you can even attempt to try and break the rules, you gotta
    fully understand what they are first. Why were they put in place? The reason behind
    that. And are they even still applicability? Because you have no idea when those
    were actually written. So you really, really need to fully understand what the
    rules are before you start to try and break or bend them. Ah, and then when you
    do, decide that like you need to step outside the black and white, start operating
    in the gray. You know what is the risk versus reward? Am I gonna cause damage
    to personnel or equipment? Am I willing to accept that risk? Is that gonna cause
    detriment to the mission? Overall, if you find that you know that none of those
    apply Ah, and that in order for you to get to your objective because you're working
    and kind of this no man's land and it requires you to break the rules, then go
    forward with it. Obviously, you know, try and get authorization first, but if
    you happen to be in a situation where you're the one that needs to make that decision.
    Then make that executive decision after you've done a quick thought analysis and
    decided that I need to step outside the bounds here in order to get this accomplished,
    and I'll deal with the consequences later. Um, so that's something that you really
    need to think about when you're starting to try and bend or break the rules.

    I came into that situation and realize that more than half of those individuals
    in there we're still lacking on certain qualifications or certain milestones that
    they should have already hit, having been at that command for as long as they
    had. And so I kind of put out that. Listen, things are gonna change a little bit
    this time of you getting out of here by noon every day since you don't have a
    class in session, you know is going away until you can show me that you've achieved
    this particular qualification that you're least working towards it and making
    an admirable effort. Working hours are gonna be what set by the commanding officer
    as 8 to 4. And we got into a pretty heated discussion and argument about that.
    There's people that were very adamant that things shouldn't change. We should
    be able to do what we want to do and leave when we need to. And I tried to explain
    to them that Listen, in the long run, you know, you're probably gonna thank me
    for this even after you leave the command. You're not gonna quite understand what
    I'm getting at, but understand that there is a method to my madness. And the whole
    point of that was that it not only is going to increase your personal and professional
    development is gonna enhance your career, but we're also improving the commands
    mission writing this because the more people that we have qualified as, say, master
    training specialists and that's going to improve our commands, mission readiness,
    we're gonna have a lot more effective training that's gonna reciprocate down to
    the people that we are training here on a daily and weekly basis. And then ultimately
    you're gonna look back and be glad that you got disqualification because of the
    opportunities you're gonna have, not only in the service, but when you get out.
    And so after that, he'd discussion, eventually got the buy in. People started
    to work on those qualifications. They got them done. And then we were able to
    go back to having kind of a flexible working hours because everyone was where
    they needed to be with their milestones and qualifications. But it was an incredible
    challenge, and it tested my fortitude on being very direct and not budging on
    with the rest of the group wanted to do which was, you know, maintain the status
    quo.

  transcript: so some different risks that we take in this field in all kind of approach
    it twofold. One is, you know, what risk do we take duty wise and job wise, and
    then risk that you might have to take a ZA leader. So as far as the duty's concerned,
    you know, working with the E o d community, um, and conducting mine countermeasures.
    We're working in austere environments around the world, operating from small boats
    in all varying types of sea state, sometimes with little to no oversight, with
    maybe only the protection that we have with us in that small boat working around
    explosives or having to find certain minds. You know, working in a in a minefield
    or even near a minefield is just risky and inherent danger. Just that alone, um,
    you know, also being, ah, diver, You know, I'm dealing with the risks that you
    intend you you feel with diving, whether it's ah, cold water and the different
    gas laws and coming up too fast for ascending and those kind of different things.
    So a lot of different risk that we deal with as a job and duty side as a leader,
    you know, The risks that you're gonna deal with is far, as you know, people's
    careers, that you're working with their personal professional development. Are
    you steering that individual in the right way? Are you providing them the right
    advice? You know, there's a risk in that because they were gonna be taking what
    you say is potential gospel and truth, and you could possibly be staring them
    down the wrong path that has the make a wrong decision and it falls back on you.
    And so there is that risk that you're dealing with is you could possibly be jeopardizing
    other people's careers or livelihood, for that matter. So those are the things
    you gotta considering the risks that I deal with in my job, as well as that of
    being a leader.

  transcript: some problems that you know I wouldn't try to resolve but would rather
    try and get help to the professional. Get that person help from a professional
    or use the resource is would be definitely anything that has to do with, like,
    marital problems. You know, I can give my advice and what I've done to keep my
    relationship going for the last 18 19 years, being married with two kids. But
    after that, I'm gonna have that individual go and get the actual proper counseling
    they need, whether that's from the chaplain or fleeting family. Because, you know,
    I'm not a marriage counselor. I could just only give you, like my opinion on certain
    things to maybe help. But that's that's far as I can go. I'll get the right person
    to help that individual out. Also, anything that has to just do with, say, suicidal
    risk. You know, I have been trained to recognize certain flags and tendencies
    and do what I can at my level. But after that I'm gonna get that individual to
    the right, either medical person or chaplain or support personnel that can really
    provide that individual with the help that they need because even though I'm trained
    to a certain level, I meant no, No needs are no way an expert in dealing with
    that. And so, God forbid, I'm responsible for somebody hurting themselves because
    I didn't get them the help that they needed. So those air kind of two examples
    I can think of that you're able to provide some level of help at your level, but
    you need to then get those individuals to the right people who are experts in
    that field.

  transcript: So what you can do if you're given an impossible situation and you're
    dealing with failures that you didn't cause is you still need to figure out Are
    you ultimately the one that's responsible? If you are the one that's responsible,
    then you still got to take ownership in that As hard as that pill is to swallow,
    you're responsible for the outcome of that situation in that mission. And so you
    need to take ownership of it, even if the failures necessarily weren't yours.
    Um, if it's something that was completely out of your control and you obviously
    need to bring that up to your chain of command and show the steps that you took
    to try and achieve this impossible mission and make it a reality and those factors
    that you we're out of your control, that caused you to fail but also to you wanna
    limit the amount of blame that you're putting on outside organizations or outside
    factors because at the end, you're still probably the one that's ultimate responsibly
    need to own that. So you're gonna have to walk around that very delicately, and
    ah, and figure out you know how you convey that measures to your superiors without
    placing blame on somebody else.

    I'm definitely direct with the person. I don't try and dance around what the issue
    is. Obviously, if it's something that's a personal issue that the person needs
    to be aware of, such as a family emergency, I'm gonna pull that individual aside
    and somewhere quiet where just the two of us could discuss the issue. But I'm
    not gonna dance around. I'm going to get right to it and say, Hey, listen, just
    got a phone call. Such and such has happened. Um, you know, here's what we're

    what they are and then helped get them to achieve that. Um, other people leave
    the Navy because they just got disenchanted with it. Maybe they had a bad experience
    and they no longer want to be part of the organization. And that's unfortunate.
    Hopefully, you're not the one that caused that feeling in that individual to where
    they wanted to leave the service. But, you know, people leave for a variety of

    it is I do, they'd probably come and tell you that that's that's not what an HT
    does. And so I've had a challenge with with progressing and making rank because
    ah viewed is not working in rate. Doing unconventional work is an H T, even though
    I kind of disagree with that that thought process, because I am filling the role
    or the billet oven ht. It just so happens that it's not traditional ht work. So
    somewhere somebody in the Navy felt that an HT needs to be doing this. And so
    that's what I'm doing. Um, and the way that I've overcome that is just continually
    to perform in whatever duty I've been given. So you know, if there's certain qualifications
    that I need to have, I get those and I totally understand them, and then I also
    help other people get them. So you have thio. If you're faced with a situation
    like that. You really have to perform and show that you deserve to be doing what
    you're doing and to get to where you're going. And so one of my biggest challenges
    is how do I make rank and show that I, you know, have leadership value and that
    I have value as an HT when I'm not doing that work.

  transcript: So I think the biggest failure that I've ever had was starting out.
    My career originally came in to be seal in the Navy. So after my initial a school
    training, I went on to their basic underwater demolition school, or buds, where
    I was there for a couple months and then got to basically the third night of hell
    week. Um, and I didn't complete the program. And so I finished out of that hell
    week not completing it and didn't graduate from buds after that. Um, and I was
    pretty devastated because that had been an initial dream and passion of mine for
    a very long time. Um, from there I kind of looked out and was able to get into
    the E o D community, not as an e o d technician, but just working with the community
    as a marine mammal handler. And I was still very young. So I also noticed that
    my maturity level probably wasn't right at that time when I was trying to go through
    to become a seal. And also I was, uh, newly married. I had a child already another
    one on the way. And so in retro spec looking back necessarily wasn't a bad decision
    of what happened, and I actually learned a lot from that. There's a lot of things
    that I even learned in the time that I was there that I have used since I've been
    in a ce faras Ah, you know, value and integrity and leadership skills that I've
    taken with me. Um and so, you know, even being devastated after that failure,
    you know, it's gonna happen, and you're able to bounce back from that and just
    find the silver lining and everything and then find the good situation that you're
    in and build on that piece.

    the norm. Or it was, you know, a stretch that it was gonna be an achievable goal.
    But we still put forth an effort. We tried our best, and in the end, you know,

    that they did the best they could. They feel that they were led the best they
    possibly could, and we still failed. All right, that's OK. So their support from
    them piers, obviously they're working with you side by side on things to get that
    accomplished. And then the superiors, you probably were the ones that gave you
    the task and knew that it was somewhat unachievable that just wanted to see if
    you could get there and you failed. Well, you know they're going to support you

    learn from those mistakes and keep moving. If you constantly dwell on that professional
    bump, then you're gonna find that it's just going to continue to compound and
    snowball into other ones that you're gonna continue to have. And it's a lingering.

    your teams watch scheduled. Obviously, you shouldn't be creating different working
    hours for yourself that aren't also aligned with your team's working hours. So
    you know if you're coming in late leaving early. But you're you're expecting your
    team to come in early and leave late. I mean, that's completely opposite of what
    should be happy. If anything is a leader, you should probably be the one that's
    there before everybody else on. More than likely, you're gonna be there after
    everybody leaves just to make sure everything's kind of buttoned up, close down
    and put away properly. So But, you know, as you move up in your leadership positions,
    you should be able to get more flexibility adjusting your working hours. You're
    still meeting mission objectives. A CZ well is balancing that that work in plate

    if your family needs to. First thing you need to do is just communicate that up
    to your chain of command and let him know that based on your situation, you think
    it best if you were to move your duty station from point A to Point B. Also look
    and see what programs out there are available. Currently. For example, there happens
    to be one that's currently in play that if you happen to have a child who is currently
    in high school and is at least two years away from graduating, you can apply for
    this and have admin. And 13 06 gets put into your detailer where you can stay
    within the same geographical region. So that way your student is gonna become
    a senior in high school isn't having to move in that high school, which could
    disrupt the ability for them to graduate. So you kind of have to do a little bit
    of a guest investigative work and see what programs air out there, which best
    suits your family situation and needs, and if you have to apply for those, apply
    form. But the biggest thing is communicate that with your chain of command and
    communicate that with your detailer placement coordinator. Make those changes
    happen in your favor.

    was that I missed the birth of both of my kids. Do the fact that I was really
    focused on where I was out of my career. So when my daughter was being born, I
    was actually in training at the time, and they had asked me if I wanted to stop
    training and go home for her birth, be there at least for a week or two. And,
    you know, I kind of talked it over with my wife and declined that because I knew
    that if I had done that, it was gonna actually have com pounding effects were
    gonna push me back in a particular training cycle. Toe wear something that I should
    be graduating with was gonna now leave me there for another six months. What your
    turn was gonna affect when I could move my wife and now a new daughter out to
    where I was gonna be stationed ultimately. So I kind of weighed those pros and
    cons and felt that, you know, I should continue on with the training. The other
    time was on deployment. My wife was pregnant When I left, I knew that she was
    gonna be do while I was deployed. My command actually asked me if I wanted to
    skip out on the deployment and stay back, do something different and I declined.
    And then, while I was out on deployment and she had had the had our son, they
    asked if I wanted to go home for that. And I also declined having talked it over
    with her only because I knew that if I had left, it was gonna affect kind of mission
    outcome in the operations that were doing their theater. So I declined those retrospect.
    I mean, obviously, I miss being there for the birth of both my kids, but knows
    that was definitely a conflict that I had to deal with between home life and work
    life.

    And so they're leaving a little bit later, and then you're gonna show up to your

    And there it was, hiccups along the way with the movers to where their truck broke
    down. Or they had additional loads that needed to get so that the date that they
    originally projected as their delivery date of your household goods. Now it's

    on a place that you're not living in anymore for 678 months over long your own
    deployment. That's money that you could essentially be pocketing in saving, um,
    also to your finances. So you want to make sure your financial stuff is in order?
    Do you have certain bills that need to be paid? Uh, get those paid off also, too.
    Is there gonna be re occurring bills that you're gonna be responsible for paying?
    How are you gonna pay those? Does it pay automatically? Or do you need to set
    up some sort of allotment to pay those while you're on deployment? Because you

  transcript: staying in touch with your family on deployment is extremely easy now
    because of the way that of all the new technological advances that we have that
    we didn't have before, you know, in the past, and I have made a deployment, this
    was even just in 2002. Really? The way I was able to stay in touch with my family
    was ah, weekly telephone call that we did at a payphone bank that was there on
    base. So you actually had to have calling cards, and then you dial up based on
    the time zone difference, you'd hope you get ahold of somebody. Ah, and then you
    talk with him until you're calling card ran out. Or, you know, you did 20 minutes
    or so. And then, of course, writing letters. I was another way to keep in constant
    communications. Now, I mean, when you deploy, you've got your cell phone, you
    might be overseas. But there's applications that you can download where you can
    actually make video calls or phone calls. You know, using WiFi and the Internet,
    you can still send letters home. If you want. You can use email you've got, you
    know, Skype and Facebook and video chat. So it's actually incredibly easy nowadays
    to stay in touch with your family on a near daily basis than it was in the past.

    you go on deployment. So who is the commando own? Bud Zeman? Who can they get
    a call? Who can they contact when you're gone? In case they do need to get a hold
    of you, this is their lifeline. That they can call. It would be that pivot point
    for you. What resource is there gonna be available to them while you're gone as
    faras medical, dental, educational stuff, counselors, career decisions, things
    like that for your family. So that's definitely something that you need to look
    at and make sure your family knows those resource is and has those phone numbers.
    And, of course, the other way is just try and stay in as much communication with
    them as possible, using things like your cell phone or applications that you can
    download on your phone or your email or doing video calls things like that to
    to stay engaged with your family while you're gone.

  transcript: military vacation or, you know, accruing leave. Um, it's routine, so
    you get so many days per month every every month that you're in service. You get
    X amount of days at a crew to your leave and depend upon your situation. You can
    have sometimes up to 90 days of leave saved on the books. If you've been on a
    deployment status for regular Navy work, usually only allowed to keep 60 days
    of leave on the books and you work with your chain of command in order to use
    that, so you'll find that they'll be, you know, several times throughout the year.
    We're already gonna get some time off, whether it's a three day weekend because
    of federal holiday or its say Thanksgiving, where you're given time off for that,
    or what's also commonly referred to his holiday stand down during the Christmas
    time and the New Year's time frame. Usually given time off for that toe, where
    you probably don't even necessarily need to use. Leave the days that you're trying
    to use leave or usually normal working days, and that's where you're gonna communicate
    that to your chain of command and ahead of time and ask for, you know, X amount
    of leave to go on vacation. Depending upon where you work, they may regulate how
    much leave you can take at a certain time period. I've worked some places where,
    you know, I could take 30 days off if I really wanted to. They would allow me
    to do that. Now, I never would do that because I know that I'd miss certain things
    and I'd be be behind in the in the work and position that on that. But if I want
    to take 30 days, I had no problem approving that. I've been other places where,
    you know, two weeks was like the maximum, and that's probably all you're gonna
    be able to get in one sitting, so you have to kind of plan for that communicated
    to your chain

    to day. And maybe you've tried to make changes and it just doesn't know is not
    making a difference in that. Then perhaps it's time for you to look at a different
    avenue to go down. This isn't for you. You've been disenchanted and you no longer
    want to be in the service. But more than likely, you're gonna be able to find
    opportunities to stay happy and always find kind of the silver linings and everything
    that you're doing and understand that the work that you're doing is bigger than
    yourself. And there's a purpose and a point toe why you're here.

  transcript: when you get to choose whether you're gonna live on base or off base
    is really dependent on where you're getting stationed and the command that you're
    at. So that's some commands and depend upon the size of the command. What they
    have is resource is you may have to live on base or even on the ship until you
    reach a particular rank or, you know you're married and have, ah have kids independence
    than you know. You're gonna have that flexibility to live out of town. But as
    a single individual independent upon your rank, you might be kind of forced to
    stay on base or live on the ship, but also is depending on your command. One particular
    place that I was stationed at, We're a small unit and even, you know, the E three's
    Andy Fours that were single were able to still get basic allowance for housing
    and live out of town because the barracks that were on the base just could not
    accommodate the people that were stationed with our unit and the particular working
    hours that we worked. They were unable to meet galley hours in order to get those
    rations at the galleys, so they were also given basic allowance for substance,
    So it's really just depending on where your station and what your dependency situation
    is.

    And I would probably recommend doing that. There's a lot of benefit to being a
    homeowner financially as well as just personally. And, um, you know, as you get
    ready to leave that area, you have several options. You can either rent your place
    out and continue to make income while you're paying the mortgage down. Or you
    can go and try and sell it. Um, or you might decide that you want to rent because
    it's easier. It's actually may be cheaper. Maybe you don't need a home because
    you're single individual, and so all you really need is a studio size apartment,
    and you're able to get away with that or you're not gonna be in that area long

    gonna be dependent on what your current financial situation is. To begin with.
    Some people come into the service, start out with nothing in their bank accounts
    where other people already have. Ah, nice nest egg built up. So that's gonna be
    dependent on where you're at. Starting out financially, however, you need to,
    you know, be good stewards with your money and make sure that you're not spending
    it on frivolous things because I can catch up with you in the long run. You need
    to live within your means and make sure that you're also putting some money away
    monthly Uh, toe for that kind of buffer, that savings buffer. And you could do
    that. Bye already having certain money allocated from your paycheck before you
    even receive it? Go directly to, say, a savings account or some other type of
    savings vehicle before you even actually touch that money. And so that's what
    I'd recommend is is taking a percentage of your money from every paycheck and
    making sure that you're paying yourself first by having to go to some sort of
    savings account and live within your means.

    misconception that you don't pay taxes. When you're in the military, you absolutely
    do. You'll find those things on your W two form that you're able to access on.
    Look at any time on the my pay website and you need to file your taxes just like
    anybody else files their taxes by the deadline. That's due one advantage that
    you do have about being in the military when it comes to. Filing your taxes, though,
    is if you're on deployment during that tax season time frame and you're unable
    to make those taxes or pay those on time or file your taxes, you're given kind
    of, ah 180 day buffer to get your taxes turned in after the date that most everyone
    else has to have their taxes done. Another advantage is if you're deployed to
    a non taxable region, then you're not actually taxed on your paycheck while you're
    there. And so, at the end of the year, when you're filing your taxes, you'll notice
    that you'll be in a lot a lot less. You'll be in a lower tax bracket because the
    income that you earned while you're deployed away fromthe states. You weren't
    being taxed on that and you won't be taxed on that. So that's kind of those two
    advantages that you have when it comes to taxes and being in the Navy.

    told, you know, Hey, you should probably go out and get yourself a house. Financially,
    I was capable of doing it. I was married. I had two kids. However, you know, we
    were renting the location that we're at wasn't bad. It was a very quick commute
    to work. But everyone around me was buying properties. And I was like, I really
    don't want to get into that because I know I'm gonna probably leaving soon, and
    I don't wanna have to deal with those responsibilities when I'm gone. Now, in
    retrospect, looking back, I would have been able to get in when the housing market
    was extremely low here in the San Diego area and would have doubled, and by now
    almost tripled the income that I would have invested on that property. So that's
    something that I really kind of kicked myself for. Not having listened to back

    that they're going through some things that they need Thio get help with and be

    that. But the biggest thing is just be respectful as well as let the chain of
    command handle the situation. And don't try and step outside what your job or
    lateral limits are with posting things on Facebook or social media before the
    chain of command actually has the opportunity to address the loved ones first.
    I've seen that happen before because now we're in this digital age where things
    can happen instantaneously, where somebody was either really hurt or even had
    died and the family found out about it via social media before the chain of command
    actually had the opportunity to either show up in person or called him directly
    and let them know that is definitely the wrong way to go about it. So let's make
    sure that it's being handled at the appropriate level and that you're respectful
    through the entire process.

    process. You know, that process is different from for everybody. Some people are
    able to just continue on like nothing's happened, where it takes other people
    a little bit longer to grieve, and you need to understand that you need to be
    accommodating for that, but also not so accommodating that is detrimental to your
    mission objectives. So you're gonna have to kind of work with that individual
    and really find out if they are getting the support that they need. What do they
    need to do to get to the next step in their grieving process? But don't feel like
    you don't ever try and rush or feel like You need to rush that individual either,
    because that's not your responsibilities to rush them through the grieving process.
    I just need to understand where they're at and how to get them the right support

    you these indicators where they're talking about, you know, things don't matter

    would give away, or they're having issues at home, and that's affecting their

    to find out why they're having a bad day. And if you're also noticing some of
    these flags that to you seem, you know, going down the wrong path, then you need
    to definitely pull that person aside and talk to them. Let him know that you care
    and listen. That's the biggest thing is. Ask him a few questions and then just
    let them talk. Let them vent. Let them get that grief off and listen to what they
    have to say and then from there, make the decision. If you need to get, get more
    support for them or if it's just, you know, a bad day and it's something that's
    gonna be ah, rectified tomorrow

    start bringing these type of thoughts or ideas up and that there's a support network
    for them. And the only way to do that is by already laying that groundwork down

    know that you care. Listen to him. Don't leave them alone. Ask him if you're able
    to take them to seek help, whether that's two medical or the chaplain or some
    other kind of resource. But the biggest thing is is get them that help that they
    need immediately before it turns into some sort of ah, snowball effect that's
    hard to come back from.

  transcript: one of the new administrative tasks that you'll have to do is a leader
    is, Ah, figure out what it is you're leading. You know? Why are you in the position
    that you are? So you need to understand fully what your job is? That's probably
    going to require you to read several documents, several guiding principles said.
    You can fully understand what your job is and how you're helping out the organization
    as a whole. And then the other administrative task that you're gonna deal with
    as a new leader is just understanding your people. So probably having to get into
    their records and research what their background is, what kind of previous training
    they already have, what areas maybe they need to get trained on based on the job
    and assignments that they're now gonna be doing. You're gonna also have to be
    recording their successes and failures when it comes time for evaluation periods
    and helping out with writing their evils. So some of the very first task you're
    gonna have is understanding your people on understanding your job, and you know
    we do that is reading and getting educated in those areas

  transcript: one way that you could make paperwork go faster is trying. Just streamline
    the process and figure out areas to reduce those administrative burdens. I mean,
    that's a direct order. Coming from Department of Defense is the major priority
    for all forces globally is reducing administrative burdens. So if you find yourself
    doing certain paperwork that you feel is just not necessary anymore, maybe there's
    a better way. Maybe this can be automated or done via computer and sent via email
    as opposed to something I have to print out, sign and route. Then find those innovative
    solutions and bring those up to your chain of command. And they should be accepting
    of those, since they've got overarching guidance, you know, from the top down
    that we need as a whole to reduce those administrative burdens. So just figure
    out a way to streamline those processes and make things more automated. Um, Tiu

  transcript: the first thing that you've got to do if you're trying to write an evaluation
    on somebody who's really deserving is you first. Gotta figure out who's the audience
    that you're writing this four and who's gonna be looking at it because different
    audiences they're gonna be reading this evaluation are gonna be looking for different
    things as well as where that person is actually in their career. You know, an
    individual who's any four. There's certain expectations that they should be achieving
    certain qualities. Qualifications or milestones at that level is any four is opposed
    to when somebody's saying EA six, they should probably already have certain things
    achieved. Now we're looking at them a little bit differently. So you need to understand
    who your audience is that you're writing this evil for and right to that, a za
    junior person that you're writing on someone who's probably any three e four,
    even he five. You know, it's probably more technical base that you're writing
    their evaluations on. How are they doing in their job? How are they improving
    technically, as well as some of their leadership skills as that individual moves
    up in rank, and now you're writing East. Sexy vows and chief, he vows, and higher.
    You know, what's most important now is how are they leading? How are they having
    an impact on the command and the Navy is a whole? And how are they professionally
    developing their subordinates and where the achievements of their subordinates.
    So in a leadership position, you know your success is derived directly from your
    subordinates success. So if your subordinates aren't being successful than you're
    failing as a leader. And so the way that you can show that an evaluation time
    is by making sure that those things were captured in those people's evaluations,
    as well as making sure that you're writing the writing, the evil to the level
    of the audience is gonna be looking at it.

  transcript: to write an evaluation on Sailor who's having problems, but it's still
    useful is you just again have to be honest in your writing. You can't, uh, you
    know, try and sugarcoat things or use flowery wording or adjectives to get around
    the issue. Hopefully, you've been doing your job as a leader anyway and have been
    mentoring that person along the way and telling them early on that they've been
    having issues and have identified those to try and have them fix them. You didn't
    wait till evil time to now drop the bomb on them that they haven't been performing
    the way that you've expected over the last year. You know, if you're doing that,
    shame on you. As a leader, you need to have gotten with that person early on to
    fix it. But let's assume that you have done that and they still, you know, aren't
    the the best or having issues. But they're still workable. We'll talk to that
    in the evaluation. Not everyone can be the Shining Star. Not everyone's gonna
    have that early promote evaluation. Some people have to be promotable, and that's
    just the reality of things. There's still worth keeping around they still can
    do the job, but they're just not necessarily ready for that next next line of
    responsibility or that next line of being promoted. And that's just the reality
    of things. You have to be honest in your reporting when you're writing evaluation,
    and you have to be honest when you're mentoring and counseling your people.

  transcript: a red flag in an evaluation that could be easily missed If you don't
    train your eye to it is just recognizing if the evaluation is generic in nature,
    you know, is it sure it might talk about some great things, but it does it answer
    the questions. So what? You know, for example, you know, semen. So and so did
    this period. Okay, so what, you know, how is that quantified? How is that bringing
    to achieving an objective or mission, you know, So if you can't answer the question,
    So what? When you're reading a sentence in an evaluation, that is probably poorly
    written as well as if the evaluation is just written in general terms. And there's
    really no quantifiable data there that really highlights what the individual is
    done for that entire year in those 18 lines that you get in the evil right up.
    Also, if things don't match, for example, the way the current evils air done,
    there's trade averages, and every single one of those trade averages can be a
    one through five. And so, for example, if somebody has a five marked in leadership
    is a trade average. But then you see nowhere in their evaluation right up in those
    18 lines where it talks about what they did is a leader to get that top five spot
    in the trade average. That should be a red flag. Why is this person getting marked
    the highest they possibly can in that leadership attributes. But yet nowhere in
    their evaluation does it talk about what they did is a leader that should be a
    red flag and something for you to recognize.
