    to a little bit more they understand that you''re very similar to them you might
    even have a very similar story that they have which creates that relationship
    and build that trust and communication and then other times depend upon the situation

    to trying to get them there I mean there''s different things you can do when the
    first things that I recommend is you know taking a pause taking a step back and
    reassess what''s going on is there something that you''re missing as a leader
    that maybe isn''t necessarily coming down to their level to help them make that
    mission achievement is there something going on personally in their life that
    you''re not aware of that has them you know not fully engage with their at work
    to make that mission accomplishment might find that after you talk with them that
    there is something going on personal and they''re unable to focus and so that
    was the issue and so you can try and help them resolve that issue or get them
    to the people that can help them resolve that in that way it''ll help hopefully
    bring them back online and get them focused again if you''ve kind of tried all
    that and you''re you''re basically at your wits and you really don''t know what
    to do obviously need to communicate that on up and say listen here the steps that
    I''ve taken to try and help my team make this mission successful or meet mission
    objectives and we''re just missing it tried ABCD any and we were you know here''s
    what we''ve done here''s the relevant proof that we''re making the best attempt
    it''s just it''s not achievable based on the situation that we have or the equipment
    or even the people that I have were unable to make that you have to communicate
    that up and communicated up early so that way set certain things to be put in
    line to maybe help bring that team or maybe they re assess what they''re asking
    you to do and and realize that that actually is unachievable and where it''s a
    big ask and nobody looked at it that way and now that you''ve tried everything
    and you''ve put out several you know courses of action and you''ve tried all those
    and are not working maybe we need to re assess what''s going on so you might find
    that''s helpful if it is achievable and you''ve just tried everything then the
    next piece is maybe you start to do a little bit of a counseling session with
    if it a particular individual and you''ve tried everything you might have to do
    some counseling with them '

  transcript: 'there are so many different ways in the navy that you can reward your
    sailors for good performance when you first have to do is just figure out what
    motivates your people you know because what motivates one person is gonna be different
    from somebody else if I''ve got somebody who''s been performing really well and
    I know that they enjoy time off then that might be what I reward them with his
    an extra day off we''re going home early or something like that if I got another
    individual who doesn''t really care about time off because they''re really driven
    and just like to work and perform up maybe I actually given more responsibility
    because that''s what they''re been seeking they want to show that they''re capable
    of taking on more so I give them that might have other individuals that are really
    you know looking for that kind of a ward or credit or something so put him in
    for the award so you you have to really just understand what drives a motive each
    each one of those individuals and then you know work towards that whenever they''re
    doing good things but always let your people know when they''re doing something
    good you know even just that that subtle it in the middle of the day Hey really
    doing you know I appreciate what you''re doing or that looks great even just that
    single comment when they''ve been working hard like that looks great are you really
    doing well there that might be enough to continue to push them on to finish that

    in your leadership styles how you can award them and reward them as well as what
    you can do with them putatively when you start dealing with civilians or certain
    lines that you just can''t cross that you might have to understand what their
    actual statement of work is and where they''re lateral lines and limits are because
    what you think you could ask a military person to do they''ll be able to do but
    a particular civilian whether government employer contractor is pretty much limited
    to what statement of work says that they can do I if you start asking them to
    do things out of that scope you can get them in trouble you can get yourself in
    trouble so you really got to understand you know what their limits are and then
    work around that and understand that you can''t necessarily hold them to the same
    punitive standard as you could a military member but they also do have their avenues
    to where let''s say you do have a civilian employee is not meeting the standards
    becoming difficult obviously you can''t discipline them yourself you might have
    to go directly to their supervisor or the the the contract supervisor whoever

    which was we had a particular piece of gear one of our you you vis which is about
    twelve feet in length and weighs about six hundred pounds and it''s really been
    tied to launching recovering from an eleven meter read and these eleven meter
    ribs you can only move them in theater from one place to another based on particular
    err strategically for choir miss that are there it''s very difficult to kind of
    get aircraft that you can fit an eleven meter ribbons side so we thought outside
    the box and figured how can we move this piece of equipment using the most smallest
    platform that we have in our arsenal which is a very small combat rubber rating
    crafter creek so this was out on deployment and we found kind of a construction
    site that had some left over plywood and foam and we basically developed a sled
    device that we were able to pull this vehicle up on two in tow behind our smallest
    platformer smallest creek that had just a thirty five horsepower engine and still
    be able to be combat effective and deploy the equipment searching for mines all
    across the theater so from that are admiral happened actually see what we have
    developed out of wood and phone Khan and got nicknamed the spruce goose and later
    he actually funded a program to develop a more robust proto type and here we are
    five years later we actually have eighteen of these operational prototypes being
    worked right now they''ve gone through several different iterations and there
    now part of the X. MCM companies tower table of allowances and they deploy with
    these things that provide us an opportunity to basically get to where we need
    to without being strong arm to using the eleven meter crew of red '

    retire from here but because I enjoy the work that I''m doing so much and as long

    trying take hold of something and and leave from the get go or else you''re not

    to get together with them first and kind of understand what their challenges are

    is obviously getting to understand your people first and and understanding what
    their strengths and weaknesses are and how you can use those to progress not only
    their personal and professional development for but the group as a whole as long
    as the group is moving forward and that in turn is going to allow the commands
    mission to move forward and increase mission readiness which in and will then
    move the entire navy''s mission forward as well and if every command is doing
    that then the the entire projection of the navy is going to be in a more positive
    direction so you can see where that starts with the very most junior person and
    understanding what their strengths are and promoting those type of attributes
    and how that then rolls into the platoon or division or department that you work
    and strengthens that entire organization and that in turn strengthens the command
    moves on towards the rest of the fleet and then in turn the navy as a whole so
    I think you know the very first steps is is understanding what your junior personnel
    on the personal at your leading whether their junior or your peers or what have
    you what their strengths and weaknesses are and what their direction what influences

    because that way the individual feels like they can open up more as opposed to
    trying to be a little stifled because they see this or you know the chief from

    important thing and then afterwards one of the board members pulled me aside and
    he said no your mission is always the single most important aspect to everything
    because without understanding the mission with that priority is and you can''t
    really understand how to prioritize your people and take care of them and so you
    need to really understand the mission if you don''t need to get out and read what
    your commander''s intent is what they''re guiding principles mission and vision

    the entire triad weather communities is very formal and your dress them by their

    kind of be looked at and ostracized as an outsider if you are too formal if you

    more informal get it works that same way people gonna look at you a little bit
    different not take you seriously and is going to jeopardize your role as a leader

    at your leading still understand where that leadership line ladies so sure you
    might work side by side with your people I''ve even on certain appointments I

    and mines under the water and now we''ve moved forward using unmanned underwater
    vehicles to do this line of work so what that does is it you know reduces the

    miles away and you''re still using equipment to do that as well as it''s helping
    to reduce that time line that we have in mind countermeasures so as you know things

    has their own you know guidance in mission and vision statement and then continue

    to than the president''s objective if you can understand from that latter well
    you know that that there was a ladder rungs from you know your boss all the way

    bit to understand that you that''s probably the single most important document
    of your entire career U. sensually have eighteen lines to summarize what you''ve
    done in a year to show like the good work that you''re doing and how you''re impacting
    mission readiness is so I wish I''d known earlier the kind of things that it takes
    to actually write a good evaluation because not only would it help me out personally
    but then as you move up as a leader your sensually writing those evaluations on
    your people if your horrible it at eve all writing then your people are gonna
    suffer they could be doing the best work across the board but if you can''t put
    that down in paper and quantify that in eighteen lines are less than your folks
    are gonna get overlooked for promotions so you know ask early on how do I write
    a good even I''ll and what do I need to do to write those evaluations to meet
    what''s being looked at '

    leadership and ask them what their expectations are of you and what they want
    to see happen not within just your individual division or platoon or department
    but for the command as a whole so you got to really understand what those goals

    doing a variety of different things is probably just that time away from my family
    there are there it I''ve I''ve missed both of my kids being born because of training
    or deployment in so those are things you can never get back and so that''s probably
    been the most challenging for me is that time away even though I do have an understanding
    family wife who''s can can operate independently and two kids now that are in
    high school and are able to kind of work on their own they don''t necessarily
    need me around all the time I still want to be there to see them you know grass
    and succeed in and help out and do the fatherly thing but they also understand
    that that''s not always going to be the case work in a line of work that we do
    so but that doesn''t mean to me is it still was a personal challenge was was being

    of integrity is as cliche as it sounds we hear it coming to boot camp all throughout
    your career you have to have that integrity but it''s true and that''s why it''s
    brought up because if you can have that self integrity to to make sure that you''re
    doing what needs to be done regardless of the situation regardless who''s around
    then internally that''s going to reflect on the people you''re gonna lead and
    they''re gonna want Amir that and model your behavior as well as the folks that
    are your leadership are going to notice that you have that integrity and that
    it''s kind of being reflected within the folks that you''re leading which in turn
    they''re gonna be able to trust you with more responsibilities and probably give
    you a lot more flexibility as well because I understand that this isn''t this
    individual has a lot of integrity folks there leading have a lot of integrity
    we can trust that person as well as that department or division that they''re
    leading to get this job done without a lot of micro management or oversight so
    again as cliche as it sounds you know it I think integrity is probably that most
    important aspect '
