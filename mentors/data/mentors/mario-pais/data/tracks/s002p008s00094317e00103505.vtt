00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.560
if you decide to take a difficult assignment you know that may affect

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.260
 your relationship with your family and friends because you could possibly

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.970
 lose that connectivity that you have with them but the nice thing

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.670
 is that we can move forward here you know technology's always advancing

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.380
 and so you know those days where it was a little bit more challenging

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.080
 to stay in touch with people when you're on difficult assignments

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.790
 are traveling all the time there really isn't that big of an

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.500
 issue anymore with with the events of cell phones in video cameras

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.200
 and email and just so simple ways of staying in touch so you have to

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.910
 kind of look at what the pros and cons are and if the pros outweigh

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.610
 the cons and you know go for that and just kind of communicate that

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.320
 there may be some challenges that you're taking this assignment but

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.020
 in the long run it's going to be best for your career hopefully ultimately

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.730
 your family and friends as well
