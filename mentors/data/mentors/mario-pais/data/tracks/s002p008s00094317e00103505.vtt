00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.560
if you decide to take a difficult assignment, that may affect your relationship

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.260
 with your family and friends, because you could possibly lose

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.970
 that connective ity that you have with them. But the nice thing

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.670
 is that we've moved forward here, technologies always advancing. And

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.380
 so you know, those days where it was a little bit more challenging

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.080
 to stay in touch with people. When you're on difficult assignments or

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.790
 traveling all the time, it really isn't that big of an issue any more,

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.500
 with with the evidence of cell phones and video cameras and e mail,

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.200
 just those simple ways of staying in touch. So you have to kind

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.910
 of look at what the pros and cons are. And if the pros outweigh the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.610
 cons and you go for that just kind of communicate that there may be

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.320
 some challenges that picking this assignment. But in the long run,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.020
 it's gonna be best for your career. Hopefully, ultimately your family

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.730
 and friends, a swell
