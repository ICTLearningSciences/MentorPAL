00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.770
how often you'll have to move is really dependent on what kind of job

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.700
 you d'oh! Um, you know, in the community that I've been in, I've seen

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.620
 individuals do their entire career here in San Diego. They've just

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.540
 moved from one duty station to the next. But because of the community

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.470
 being the E o. D community, there's several E O. D mobile units here

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.390
 in San Diego. There's also Sir Ah, training unit, which is considered

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.310
 the shore duty for you D folks here in San Diego. So I've seen

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.230
 people do an entire 20 years and lived in San Diego their entire time.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.160
 They've just moved around from one mobile unit to another. Ah, whereas

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.080
 depending upon other jobs, you might find yourself having to

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.000
 move from one coast to the next or even overseas. It just really is

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.930
 dependent on the job that you do and what your duty is and where you're

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.850
 at progressing in your career ladder
