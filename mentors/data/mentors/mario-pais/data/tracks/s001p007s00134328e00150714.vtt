00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.660
So how much leadership should you take on if you're coming in to say that

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.470
 that first leadership position is a petty officer, probably the

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.280
 lpo. The first thing you want to do is establish those expectations

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.100
 between your L CPO and whoever you're. All I see is, you know, what

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.910
 are their expectations of you as now the lpo, the person who's really

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.720
 down there every day dealing with sailors face to face, who probably

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.530
 knows more intimately about There are things that are going on, you

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.340
 know, they're the command as well as behind the scenes, you know,

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.150
 So you need to get with your leadership and understand. Okay, what

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.960
 are your expectations is the lpo, and then also let them know what your

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.780
 expectations are As them is your leaders, they're not going to be

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.590
 able to provide good service to you or the folks that you're leading

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.400
 as an L. P O. If you don't provide them what it is you're looking

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.210
 for, and as a leader, you've got to be able t talk to those that are

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.020
 in charge of you and ask them what their expectations are as well

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.830
 as what you expect of them as your leadership. You can't be afraid to

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.640
 do that. That's one of those challenges now that you're a leader is

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.450
 t Go out and talk to those folks that that are your superiors and

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.270
 kind of give them your expectations as well. And I think that kind of

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.080
 opens up that dialogue and provides that cross. You know, that that

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.890
 flat line of communication. So that way, everybody is kind of running

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.700
 on the same gear.
