00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.840
so how much leadership should you take on if you're coming in to say that

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.840
 that first leadership position as a petty officer probably the PO

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.830
 the first thing you want to do is establish those expectations between

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.820
 your L. CPO and whoever you're all I see is it what are their expectations

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.810
 of you as now the LPO the person who's really down there

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.810
 every day dealing with the sailors face to face who probably knows

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.800
 more intimately about their things that are going on you know they're

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.790
 the command as well as behind the scenes you know so you need to get

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.790
 with your leadership and understand okay what are your expectations

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.780
 as the PO and also let them know what your expectations are as them

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.770
 as your leaders no they're not gonna be able to provide good service

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.760
 to you or the folks that you're leading as LPO if you don't provide

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.760
 them what it is you're looking for and as a leader you've got to

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.750
 be able to stay to talk to those that are in charge of you and ask

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.740
 them what their expectations are as well as what you expect of them

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.740
 as your leadership you can't be afraid to do that that's one of those

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.730
 challenges now that you're a leader is to to go out and talk to those

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.720
 folks that that or your superiors and and kind of give them your

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.710
 expectations as well and I think that kind of opens up that dialoguing

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.710
 and provides that cross you know that that flat line of communication

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.700
 so that way everybody's kind of running on the same gear
