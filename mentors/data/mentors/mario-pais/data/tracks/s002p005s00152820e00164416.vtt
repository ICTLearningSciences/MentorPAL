00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.650
you might find that certain sailors in your team cause problems and one

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.450
 way that you can improve that is making sure they all understand what

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.240
 their purpose is. You'll find a lot of times that people really

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.040
 don't know why they're doing what they're doing or why they're there.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.840
 A simple way to find that out is just sit down with each person individually

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.640
 and ask them, Why are you here? Don't be condescending when

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.440
 you ask, obviously. But see if they actually understand what their

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.230
 purpose is. Why are they doing the job that they're doing? Why are

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.030
 they coming in every day from 9 to 5, working on this particular mission?

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.830
 Objective equipment. What have you and really peel that back?

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.630
 You'll find a lot of people really don't understand why they're doing

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.430
 what they're doing, and you got to keep kind of probing and don't

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.220
 take their first answer as the full one because it's more than likely

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.020
 gonna be superficial. You might have to actually educate them on

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.820
 why they're here and how they fit into the bigger picture. And once

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.620
 they really understand that, and why that they're why they're doing

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.420
 what they're doing and how they're actually part of, ah, larger goal.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.210
 Then they're gonna have that buy in, and hopefully that will start

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.010
 improving the issues that you're having with some of those people.
