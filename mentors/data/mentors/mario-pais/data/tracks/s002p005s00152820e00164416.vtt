you might find that certain sailors in your team cause problems in one

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.850
 way that you can improve that is making sure they all understand what

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.840
 their purposes you'll find a lot of times that people really don't

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.840
 know why they're doing what they're doing or why they're there a simple

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.840
 way to find that out is just sit down with each person individually

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.840
 and ask them you know why are you here don't be condescending

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.840
 when you ask obviously but see if they actually understand what their

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.830
 purpose is why are they doing the job that they're doing why are they

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.830
 coming in every day from nine to five working on this particular

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.830
 mission objective equipment what have you and and really people that

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.830
 back you'll find a lot of people really don't understand why they're

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.820
 doing what they're doing and you gotta keep kind of probing and don't

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.820
 take their first answer as the form because it's more than likely

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.820
 going to be superficial you might have to actually educate them on

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.820
 why they're here and how they fit in to the bigger picture and once

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.820
 they really understand that and why that third why they're doing what

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.810
 they're doing and how they're actually part of a larger goal then

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.810
 they're gonna have that buy in and hopefully they'll start improving

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.810
 the issues that you're having with some of those people
