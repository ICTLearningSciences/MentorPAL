00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.060
The Navy's marine mammal program has been in existence since, ah, the

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.280
 early seventies, where they were using dolphins and sea lions to conduct

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.490
 different operations. For example, the dolphin's back in Vietnam

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.710
 were actually brought there, and we're doing anti swimmer, anti diver

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.920
 defense in Cam Ranh Bay. Um, and then the sea lions came online

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.140
 when they discovered that it was a lot more faster and effective to

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.350
 use. These see lines that can dive down to several 100 feet of depth

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.570
 to recover training minds, as opposed to sending down a diver who could

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.780
 take, you know, hours to get down to a depth of that hook up and

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.000
 then come back to the surface. So the Navy's been using marine mammals

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.210
 since then to basically conduct, you know, mine countermeasures

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.430
 as well as, AH, anti swimmer and diver defense, and they still continue

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.640
 to have them. Even though we are moving forward with advanced technology,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.860
 the marine mammal systems are still an option for the Navy

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.070
 to use
