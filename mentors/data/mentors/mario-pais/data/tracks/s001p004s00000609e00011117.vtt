00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.470
so at some common misconception about my field or or let's say more in

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.080
 general terms leadership positions let's go that route is that the

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.700
 leader is expected to know everything and that's not necessarily true

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.310
 right the leaders we put our pants on the same as everybody else there's

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.930
 no mystery here we just might have a little bit more experience

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.540
 and time doing something so doesn't necessarily mean that we know

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.160
 all the answers to everything however as the leader should be able

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.770
 to try and find those answers so you might you might not necessarily

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.390
 know right off the bat what the answer is to particular question what

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.010
 you should at least know what resources you can go to to find out

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.620
 whether that's utilizing your peers within say the chiefs master the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.240
 wardroom or if you're an LP using your peers that are in the UFC P.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.850
 O. a or the other folks that you work with to find those answers when

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.470
 you're in that leadership position but don't have that misconception

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.080
 that I'm a leader I must know everything I must be able to answer

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.700
 everything right off the bat that's not the case you can take some

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.310
 time to get to an answer if need be make sure that you do it right

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.930
