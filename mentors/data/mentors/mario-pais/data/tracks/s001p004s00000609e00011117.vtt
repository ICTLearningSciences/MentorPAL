00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.470
so some common misconception about my field or let's same or in general

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.080
 terms, leadership positions. Let's go in that route is that you know

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.700
 the leader is expected to know everything, and that's not necessarily

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.310
 true, right? The leaders, We put our pants on the same as everybody

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.930
 else. There's no mystery here. We just might have a little bit

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.540
 more experience, a time of doing something. So it doesn't necessarily

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.160
 mean that we know all the answers to everything, however, as the leader

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.770
 should be able to try and find those answers. So you know, you

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.390
 might not necessarily know right off the bat what the answer is to

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.010
 particular question. But you should at least know what resource is You

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.620
 can go to to find that whether that's utilizing your peers within,

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.240
 say, the chief's mess with a wardroom or if you're in lpo using your

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.850
 peers that are in the you know F c p o. A. Or the other folks that

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.470
 you work with to find those answers when you're in that leadership

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.080
 position, but don't have that misconception that I'm a leader, I must

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.700
 know everything. I must be able to answer everything right off the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.310
 bat. That's not the case. You can take some time to get to an answer

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.930
 if need be, to make sure that you do it right.
