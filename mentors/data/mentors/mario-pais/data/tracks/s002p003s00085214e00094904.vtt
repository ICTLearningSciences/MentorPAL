00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.640
if I'm looking at getting feedback from a supervisor as trouble actually

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.440
 providing feedback is either unwilling or they're just not good at

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.230
 it I'll just have a blade in conversation with them you know I'll

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.020
 find a time where I can sit down with them and say you know listen I

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.820
 value your feedback I value your input I'm looking for that as an individual

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.610
 from you and seems that we have a challenge here what can

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.400
 we do to improve this relationship between you and I so that way you're

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.200
 able to provide the feedback that I'm looking for because I'm wanting

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.990
 that so that I can continue to do good work for you and for the

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.780
 organization as a whole she just gonna have to sit down and have that

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.580
 candid conversation with that person and let him know that you're

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.370
 not getting what it is you're looking for and is there is it an issue

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.160
 because of something maybe your doing internally or is it something

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.960
 that that individuals having that we need to figure out together

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.750
