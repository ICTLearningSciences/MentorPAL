00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.640
if I'm looking at getting feedback from a supervisor as trouble actually

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.440
 providing feedback because either unwilling or they're just not good

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.230
 at it. Um, I'll just have a blatant conversation with him. You know,

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.020
 I'll find a time where I can sit down with them and say, Listen,

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.820
 I value your feedback. I value your input. Um, I'm looking for that

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.610
 as an individual from you and seems that we have a challenge here.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.400
 What can we do to improve this relationship between you and I? So that

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.200
 way you're able to provide the feedback that I'm looking for because

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.990
 I'm wanting that so that I can continue to do good work for you

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.780
 and for the organization as a whole. So you just kind of have to sit

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.580
 down and have that candid conversation with that person and let him

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.370
 know that you're not getting what it is you're looking for. And is

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.160
 there isn't an issue because of something maybe you're doing internally,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.960
 Or is it something that that individuals having that we need to

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.750
 figure out together
