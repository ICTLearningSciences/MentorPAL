00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.850
The best plan for your family if they have an emergency and you're away

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.850
 is for them to make sure they have the phone numbers that they need

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.850
 ahead of time so that they can address those issues. Obviously, if

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.850
 it's an emergency, they ought to be going 911 right? But after that,

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 if they need to get a hold of you, you know there's the commando Bussmann

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.860
 that they could get ahold of who has a direct link to the commanding

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.860
 officer and the CMC of that unit. To then get ahold of you

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.860
 to try and get you home and they'll be able to use the resource is like

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.860
 Red Cross or some other avenue thio get you home if need be in the

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.860
 event of an emergency.
