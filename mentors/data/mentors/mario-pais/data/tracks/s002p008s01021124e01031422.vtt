00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.550
some of I said I was given that I wish I really what it took was when

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.260
 I first got station here in San Diego and I had for your orders which

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.960
 then ultimately turned into five and a half years at the same place

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.670
 was I was told you know Hey you should probably go out and and get

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.370
 yourself a house you know financially I was capable of doing it I was

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.080
 married I had two kids however you know we were renting the location

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.780
 that we're out wasn't bad it was very quick commute to work but

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.490
 everyone around me was buying properties and I was like I really don't

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.190
 want to get into that because I know I'm gonna probably be leaving

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.900
 soon I don't want to have to do with those responsibilities when I'm

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.600
 gone now in retrospect looking back I would have been able to get

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.310
 in when the housing market was extremely low here in the San Diego

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.010
 area and what of doubled in by now almost tripled the income that I

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.720
 would have invested on that property so that's something that I really

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.420
 kind of kick myself for not having listened to back in two thousand

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.130
 and two that you know now and twenty nineteen I probably should have

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.830
 done
