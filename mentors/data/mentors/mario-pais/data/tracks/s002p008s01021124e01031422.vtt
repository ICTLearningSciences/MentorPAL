00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.550
some advice that I was given that I wish I really would have took was

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.260
 when I first got stationed here in San Diego and I had four year orders,

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.960
 which then ultimately turned into five and 1/2 years at the same

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.670
 place was Ah, I was told, you know, Hey, you should probably go out

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.370
 and get yourself a house. Financially, I was capable of doing it.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.080
 I was married. I had two kids. However, you know, we were renting the

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.780
 location that we're at wasn't bad. It was a very quick commute to

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.490
 work. But everyone around me was buying properties. And I was like,

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.190
 I really don't want to get into that because I know I'm gonna probably

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.900
 leaving soon, and I don't wanna have to deal with those responsibilities

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.600
 when I'm gone. Now, in retrospect, looking back, I would have

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.310
 been able to get in when the housing market was extremely low here

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.010
 in the San Diego area and would have doubled, and by now almost tripled

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.720
 the income that I would have invested on that property. So that's

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.420
 something that I really kind of kicked myself for. Not having listened

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.130
 to back in 2000 and two that, you know, now and 2019 I probably

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.830
 should have done
