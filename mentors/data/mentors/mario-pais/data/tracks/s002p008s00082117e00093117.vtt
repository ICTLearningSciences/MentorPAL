00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.740
there's a variety of options out there to transfer a change your duty

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.630
 if your family needs to person you need to do is just communicate that

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.520
 up your chain of command and let him know that based on your situation

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.410
 you think it be best if you were to move your duty station from

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.290
 point a to point B. also look and see what programs out there available

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.180
 currently for example there happens to be one that's currently

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.070
 in play that if you happen to have a child who is currently in high

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.960
 school and is at least two years away from graduating you can apply

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.850
 for this and have admin and thirteen oh six gets put into your detail

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.740
 or where you can stay within the same geographical region so that

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.630
 way your student is going to become a senior in high school isn't having

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.520
 to move from that high school which can disrupt the ability for

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.410
 them to graduate so you kind of have to do a little bit of a guest

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.290
 investigative work and see what programs are out there which best suits

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.180
 your family situation and needs and if you have to apply for those

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.070
 apply form but the biggest thing is communicate that with your chain

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.960
 of command and communicate that with your detailer placement coordinator

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.850
 to hopefully make those changes happen in your favor
