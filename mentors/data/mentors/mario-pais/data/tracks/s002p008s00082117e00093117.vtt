00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.740
there's a variety of options out there to transfer. Change your duty if

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.630
 your family needs to. First thing you need to do is just communicate

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.520
 that up to your chain of command and let him know that based on your

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.410
 situation, you think it best if you were to move your duty station

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.290
 from point A to Point B. Also look and see what programs out there

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.180
 are available. Currently. For example, there happens to be one that's

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.070
 currently in play that if you happen to have a child who is currently

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.960
 in high school and is at least two years away from graduating,

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.850
 you can apply for this and have admin. And 13 06 gets put into your

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.740
 detailer where you can stay within the same geographical region. So

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.630
 that way your student is gonna become a senior in high school isn't

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.520
 having to move in that high school, which could disrupt the ability

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.410
 for them to graduate. So you kind of have to do a little bit of a guest

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.290
 investigative work and see what programs air out there, which best

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.180
 suits your family situation and needs, and if you have to apply

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.070
 for those, apply form. But the biggest thing is communicate that with

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.960
 your chain of command and communicate that with your detailer placement

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.850
 coordinator. Make those changes happen in your favor.
