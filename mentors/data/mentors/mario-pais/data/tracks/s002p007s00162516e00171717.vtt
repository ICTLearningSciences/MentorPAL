00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.320
support that I've had when I've taken a chance in the results been poor

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.780
 have been not only from subordinates and my peers but also just are

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.250
 my superiors as well because they're aware that maybe what we're trying

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.720
 to do was outside the norm or it was you know of a stretch that

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.190
 it was gonna be an achievable goal but we still put forth an effort

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.650
 we tried our best and in the end you know it just didn't happen so

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.120
 you know with the subordinates feel that like they know that they did

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.590
 the best they could they feel that they were led the best they possibly

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.060
 could and we still feel it failed all right that's okay so their

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.520
 support from them here's obviously they're working with you side

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.990
 by side on things to get that accomplished and then this appears you

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.460
 probably were the ones that they gave you the task and knew that it

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.930
 was somewhat unachievable the just wanted to see if you can get there

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.390
 and you failed well you know they're going to support you as well

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.860
