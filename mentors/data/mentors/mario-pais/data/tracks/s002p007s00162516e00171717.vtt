00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.320
of support that I've had when I've taken a chance and the results been

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.780
 poor have been not only from subordinates on my peers, but also just

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.250
 are my superiors as well, because they were aware that maybe what

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.720
 we're trying to do was outside the norm. Or it was, you know, a stretch

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.190
 that it was gonna be an achievable goal. But we still put forth

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.650
 an effort. We tried our best, and in the end, you know, it just didn't

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.120
 happen. So, you know, the subordinates feel that, like, they know

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.590
 that they did the best they could. They feel that they were led the

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.060
 best they possibly could, and we still failed. All right, that's OK.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.520
 So their support from them piers, obviously they're working with you

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.990
 side by side on things to get that accomplished. And then the superiors,

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.460
 you probably were the ones that gave you the task and knew that

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.930
 it was somewhat unachievable that just wanted to see if you could

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.390
 get there and you failed. Well, you know they're going to support

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.860
 you as well.
