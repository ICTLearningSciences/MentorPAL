00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.190
one way that you can tell if somebody is going to be a good mentor is

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.530
 their ability to ah, listen to you and relate to you as you're talking

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.870
 with that individual. You know, if you're able to hold an actual

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.210
 conversation and have good communication with that person, then you're

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.560
 going to know that they're probably gonna work out is a good mentor

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.900
 for you. If you're looking for that, um, you know what is what have

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.240
 they done in their career? Is it something that you want to mimic

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.580
 or mirror? Then that's probably an individual that you want to look

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.920
 at as a mentor as well.
