00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.660
certain resource is that you'd want to look at a CZ. You're moving into

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.460
 the leadership position, you know, and there's books and all those

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.270
 things out there that people have written hundreds of books on leadership.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.080
 Um, you know, if if that's the kind of thing that you're into

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.880
 and you like reading those type of books, go on Thio your nearest

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.690
 book website, find out the top 10 and start reading those, Um, I also

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.490
 recommend that you understand what your leaderships, overarching guidance

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.300
 and principles are so that you could be in step with what they're

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.110
 trying to do. And so that goes from not only you know your CEO's

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.910
 intent and guidance, but his boss's boss and his boss's boss's boss

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.720
 all the way up to the highest levels. And so you you have to read

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.530
 those kind of documents and understand that structure, and that's gonna

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.330
 help you out and becoming a leader and making sure that at the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.140
 very least, you're pointed in the right direction that your command

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.940
 and the Navy needs for you to be as your leading your subordinates.
