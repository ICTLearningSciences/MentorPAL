00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.390
ways that you can take lessons that you learned and any kind of leadership

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.930
 school our offer for schools and then trying to apply it in your

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.470
 day to day work is it you know you you've been just a lot you know

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.010
 a lot of times you might be drinking from the fire hose at these particular

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.550
 schools you're only going to remember so much maybe you've

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.090
 gotten those books you brought them back you've got your notes that

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.630
 you've taken in those schools reference those from time to time and

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.170
 trying to apply those theories and then and the lessons that you've

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.710
 learned you know little at a little bit at a time you know I could be

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.250
 able to take the entire thing walk right in and and know it all and

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.800
 be able to apply everything you've learned during that eight week

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.340
 school and think that you've got it but if you look at every little

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.880
 piece and then try and do it systematically bit by bit then you'll be

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.420
 able to really apply those lessons that you've learned and you might

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.960
 find that some of the stuff that you weren't those schools is kind

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.500
 of outdated and the curriculum maybe hasn't been updated in awhile

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.040
 and so it's no longer works that way but guarantee there's been some

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.580
 good golden nuggets that you've picked up at those schools that you

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.120
 can take in trying to apply a little at a time into you fully grasp

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.660
 the concepts
