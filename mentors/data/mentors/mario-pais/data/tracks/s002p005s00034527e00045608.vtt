00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.390
ways that you can take lessons that you learn in any kind of leadership

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.930
 school or officer schools and then try and apply it in your day to

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.470
 day work is, you know, you've ingested a lot. You know, a lot of times

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.010
 you might be drinking from the fire hose at these particular schools.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.550
 You're only gonna remember so much. Maybe you've gotten those

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.090
 books. You brought them back. You've got your notes that you've taken

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.630
 in those schools, reference those from time to time and try and apply

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.170
 those theories and then and the lessons that you've learned, you

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.710
 know, a little, a little bit at a time. You know, I could be able to

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.250
 take the entire thing, walk right in and and know it all and be able

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.800
 to apply everything you've learned during that eight weeks school

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.340
 and think that you've got it. But if you look at every little piece

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.880
 and then try and do it systematically bit by bit, then you'll be able

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.420
 to really apply those lessons that you've learned on. And then you

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.960
 might find that some of the stuff that you learn those schools is

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.500
 kind of outdated, and the curriculum maybe hasn't been updated in a

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.040
 while, and so it no longer works that way but guaranteed. There's been

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.580
 some good golden nuggets that you've picked up at those schools that

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.120
 you can take and try and apply a little at a time until you fully

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.660
 grasp the concepts.
