00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.660
I think a lot of times what gets romanticized is that we're constantly

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.480
 out there doing, you know, dangerous or hazardous work. And so a lot

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.290
 of times people are given credit or kudos for things that they might

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.100
 not necessarily do all the time on a daily basis. And so you know,

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.920
 not everybody in the Navy and not everybody, even in this community,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.730
 is an operator, a shooter, and is going down range, you know, creating

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.550
 havoc to the faux face to face. You know, there are other people

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.360
 out there that they're they're doing a lot of good work in the logistical

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.170
 side and the supporting side, or they're also considered enablers

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.990
 that allow those real special operators to go and do their work.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.800
 But you know, those enablers don't necessarily get the credit that

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.610
 they're do where they get looked at inappropriately. And, oh, you're

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.430
 in that community. So you must do this. We necessarily they don't.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.240
 So I think that might be something that gets romanticized a lot about.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.060
 But a lot of people don't really understand what goes behind making

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.870
 good operations work, and it's those people that do that
