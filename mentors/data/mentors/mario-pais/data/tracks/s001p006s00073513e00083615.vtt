00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.660
I think a lot of times gets romanticizes that were constantly out there

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.480
 doing you know dangerous or hazardous work and so a lot of times people

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.290
 are given creditor kudos for things that they might not necessarily

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.100
 do all the time on a daily basis and so you know not everybody

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.920
 in the navy and not everybody even in this community is a is an operator

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.730
 shooter is going down range you know creating havoc to the faux

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.550
 face to face you know there are other people out there that are that

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.360
 are doing a lot of good work in the logistical side the supporting

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.170
 side there also considered enablers that allow those real special

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.990
 operators to go and do their work but you know those enablers don't

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.800
 necessarily get the credit that there do or they get looked at in appropriately

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.610
 and you're in that community so you must do this when necessarily

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.430
 they don't so I think that might be something that gets romanticized

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.240
 a lot about but a lot of people don't really understand what

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.060
 goes behind making good operations work and it's those people that

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.870
 do that
