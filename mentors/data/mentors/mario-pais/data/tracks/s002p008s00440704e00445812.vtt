00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.500
one of the benefits you should take advantage of is going to be. What

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.150
 the Navy has is the thrift savings plan. And so that's where you're

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.800
 taking a portion of your money and you're putting it away for the future.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.440
 And there's a variety of different funds that you can invest your

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.090
 money in, and you can do up to a certain percentage of your paycheck

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.740
 every month on that money is gonna go away. And you're not really

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.390
 gonna touch that until you're, you know, later in your retirement

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.040
 years. And that money's just gonna grow, and you should be contributing

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.690
 to that every single month. So look into what new kind of benefits

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.340
 are being offered for the thrift savings plan, the blended retirement

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.980
 system, and take advantage of those things because, you know,

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.630
 you're not always gonna be in the Navy forever, and you need to have

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.280
 some sort of nest egg and savings plan built up for when you leave
