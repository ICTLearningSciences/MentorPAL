00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.450
if I could change one thing at my job, I think that would be the acquisition

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.060
 process. So a lot of times, you know you'll identify a shortfall

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.660
 or a need for a resource and because of certain things that are

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.270
 put in place right now, some of the bureaucratic red tape that you have

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.870
 to go through in order to get that resource the time you've identified

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.470
 it, that's usually the time that you actually need it. But then

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.080
 when you request it, it could take weeks, months, maybe even a year

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.680
 or more until you finally actually see it. And by then it's too late.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.290
 I needed that thing a year ago. So, you know, I think a CZ The

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.890
 Navy continues to move forward. They are looking at ways to streamline

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.490
 the acquisition process and get equipment, and resource is into the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.100
 end users hands a lot faster, but it can be frustrating right now

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.700
 when you need that piece of gear, that equipment today and as soon

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.310
 as that you're going to see it is probably gonna be months from now
