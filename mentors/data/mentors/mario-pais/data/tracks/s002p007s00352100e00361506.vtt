00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.710
if I could change one thing at my job I think that would be the the acquisition

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.570
 process so a lot of times you know you'll identify a shortfall

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.430
 or a need for a resource and because the certain things that are

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.300
 put in place right now some of the bureaucratic red tape that you

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.160
 have to go through in order to get that resource the time you've identified

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.020
 it that's usually the time that you actually need it but then

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.880
 when you requested it could take weeks months maybe even a year more

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.740
 into you finally actually see it and by then it's too late I needed

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.600
 that thing a year ago so you know I think you as the navy continues

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.460
 to move forward they are looking at ways to streamline the acquisition

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.330
 process and get equipment and resources into the end users hands

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.190
 a lot faster but it can be frustrating right now when you need that

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.050
 piece of gear that equipment today and the soonest that you're gonna

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.910
 see is probably gonna be months from now
