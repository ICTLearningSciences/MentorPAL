00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.030
the way that I'm preparing for my next promotion is by understanding you

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.220
 know what is the navy actually looking for for the individuals that

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.400
 they intend to promote to the next pay grade so every year the certain

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.580
 documents are published for those that are moving up in rank whether

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.760
 you're going from east six to the chief and chief to senior chief

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.940
 senior chief to pass chief petty officer there's documents that

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.130
 are posed to say this is what the navy is looking for on individuals

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.310
 that are not only meeting goals but also exceeding those and so my

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.490
 goal is if I want to get promoted the next rank is to understand where

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.680
 the navy is heading what it wants to do by reading those documents

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.860
 to making sure that I'm a lining the work that I'm doing today that's

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.040
 gonna give me my best opportunity to promote
