00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.030
the way that I'm preparing for my next promotion is by understanding what

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.220
 is the Navy actually looking for for the individuals that they intend

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.400
 to promote to the next pay grade. So every year, the certain documents

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.580
 are published for those that are moving up in rank, whether

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.760
 you're going from EA six toe Chief Chief to senior chief senior Chief

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.940
 Toe Master, Chief Petty Officer, there's documents that are posed

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.130
 to say, this is what the Navy is looking for on individuals that, um,

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.310
 are not only meeting goals, but also exceeding those. And so my goal

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.490
 is if I want to get promoted, the next rank is to understand where

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.680
 the Navy is heading and what it wants to do by reading those documents

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.860
 and making sure that I'm aligning the work that I'm doing to that,

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.040
 um, that's gonna give me my best opportunity to promote
