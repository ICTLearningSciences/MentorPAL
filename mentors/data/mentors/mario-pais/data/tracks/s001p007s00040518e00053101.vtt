00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.580
so I think one of the common things that I've seen leaders make that's

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.310
 a mistake and it is a challenge to kind of over com is not really understanding

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.050
 your people to the full intent as well as not understanding

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.780
 what your mission is in your requirements for that mission something

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.510
 that was asked me one time when I was sitting on SO keyboard years

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.240
 ago was you know what is more important the mission or your people

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.970
 and at the time I had said well my people the most important thing

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.700
 and then afterwards one of the board members pulled me aside and

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.440
 he said no your mission is always the single most important aspect to

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.170
 everything because without understanding the mission with that priority

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.900
 is and you can't really understand how to prioritize your people

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.630
 and take care of them and so you need to really understand the mission

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.360
 if you don't need to get out and read what your commander's intent

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.090
 is what they're guiding principles mission and vision are understand

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.830
 that and how you fit into that overall peace and then once you

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.560
 understand that you can then direct the folks that you lead into accomplishing

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.290
 that and once they know where they fit in and the overall

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.020
 spoke and how they can play a part in that big wheel and you'll notice

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.750
 that they're gonna make everything moved forward and everything

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.480
 kind of just will run seamlessly so you know without fully understanding

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.220
 your mission and without fully understanding your people that

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.950
 is going to put you out a hurdle and it's really hard it's really something

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.680
 hard to recover from
