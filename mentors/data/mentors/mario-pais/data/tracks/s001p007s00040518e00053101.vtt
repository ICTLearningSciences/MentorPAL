00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.580
So I think one of the common things that I've seen leaders make that's

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.310
 a mistake is a challenge to kind of overcome is not really understanding

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.050
 your people to the full intent as well. Is not understanding what

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.780
 your mission is in your requirements for that mission? Um, something

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.510
 that was asked to me one time when I was sitting on and eso que

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.240
 board years ago was you know what is more important, the mission or

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.970
 your people? And at the time I had said, Well, my people are the most

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.700
 important thing. And then afterwards one of the board members pulled

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.440
 me aside and he said, No, your mission is always a single most important

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.170
 aspect to everything because without understanding the mission

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.900
 and what that priority is, and you can't really understand how to

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.630
 prioritize your people and take care of them, and so you need to really

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.360
 understand the mission. If you don't need to get out and read

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.090
 what your commander's intent is, what their guiding principles, mission

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.830
 and vision are, understand that and how you fit into that overall

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.560
 piece. And then once you understand that you can then direct the folks

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.290
 that you lead into accomplishing that. And once they know where

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.020
 they fit in and the overall spoke and how they can play a part in that

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.750
 big wheel and you'll notice that they're going to make everything

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.480
 move forward and everything kind of just will run seamlessly. So,

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.220
 you know, without fully understanding your mission and without fully

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.950
 understanding your people, that is gonna put you out of hurdle and

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.680
 it's really hard. It's really something hard to recover from.
