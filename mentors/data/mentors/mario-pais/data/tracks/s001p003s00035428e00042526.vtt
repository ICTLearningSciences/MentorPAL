00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.720
some tips to earn the trust. Your team is just building that communication

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.590
 layer between you and them and opening up that dialogue. They shouldn't

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.470
 be able or they shouldn't be afraid to come to you to ask questions.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.340
 Whether that's, you know, you have an open door policy or

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.210
 there's a particular time that they know they can come to talk to you.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.080
 When they do do that, you're intently listening and you're building

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.960
 that open dialogue and communication, which in turn is gonna improve

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.830
 and build their trust with you as their leader.
