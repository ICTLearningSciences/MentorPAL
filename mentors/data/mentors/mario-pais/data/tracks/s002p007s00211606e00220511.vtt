00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.310
some of the most dangerous things that I've done on the job I also consider

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.770
 maybe being some of the most fun because I do have a tendency

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.230
 to gravitate towards you know adrenaline rush type type thing so you're

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.690
 working with explosives jumping out of helicopters diving working

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.150
 in small boats you know launching from the back of an L. H. D. at

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.600
 night where the sea states a little iffy in a small boat where you have

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.060
 the potential of getting overturned there on the well deck on the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.520
 stern gate near that can be kind of dangerous but also find those

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.980
 those challenges kind of exhilarating and fun so you know for me things

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.440
 that look kind of dangers have a tendency to also turn in to be

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.900
 something that's enjoyable and and find
