00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.940
some of the most dangerous things that I've done on the job. I also consider

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.020
 maybe being some of the most fun because I do have a tendency

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.110
 to gravitate towards, you know, adrenaline rush type type thing. So,

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.200
 you know, working with explosives, uh, jumping out of helicopters,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.290
 diving, working in small boats, launching from the back of Ah, L h

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.370
 D at night where the sea states a little, Um, if he in a small boat

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.460
 where you have the potential of getting overturned there on the well

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.550
 deck and on the stern gate, you know, that could be kind of dangerous.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.640
 But also find those those challenges kind of exhilarating and fund.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.720
 So, um, you know, for me, things that look kind of dangerous have

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.810
 a tendency to also turn in to be something that's enjoyable and fun.
