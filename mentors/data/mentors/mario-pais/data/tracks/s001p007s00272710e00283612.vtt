00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.160
one question that I wish I had asked earlier in my career was just how

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.480
 to properly do an evil how to write and evil. Um, you know, it took

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.790
 me a little bit to understand that that's probably the single most

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.100
 important document of your entire career. You essentially have 18 lines

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.420
 to summarize what you've done in a year to show, like the good work

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.730
 that you're doing and how you're impacting mission readiness. And

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.050
 so I wish that I had known earlier the kind of things that it takes

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.360
 to actually write a good evaluation, because not only would it help

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.670
 me out personally, but then, as you move up a za leader, you essentially

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.990
 writing those evaluations on your people. If you're horrible

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.300
 at evil writing than your people are going to suffer, they could be

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.610
 doing the best work across the board. But if you can't put that down

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.930
 on paper and quantify that in 18 lines or less than your folks are

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.240
 gonna get overlooked for promotions, so you know, ask early on, how

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.560
 do I write a good evil? And what do I need to do to write those evaluations

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.870
 to meet what's being looked at
