00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.160
one question that I wish I had asked earlier in my career was just how

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.480
 to properly do and even even how to write an email you know it took

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.790
 me a little bit to understand that you that's probably the single most

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.100
 important document of your entire career U. sensually have eighteen

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.420
 lines to summarize what you've done in a year to show like the good

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.730
 work that you're doing and how you're impacting mission readiness

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.050
 is so I wish I'd known earlier the kind of things that it takes to

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.360
 actually write a good evaluation because not only would it help me

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.670
 out personally but then as you move up as a leader your sensually writing

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.990
 those evaluations on your people if your horrible it at eve all

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.300
 writing then your people are gonna suffer they could be doing the

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.610
 best work across the board but if you can't put that down in paper and

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.930
 quantify that in eighteen lines are less than your folks are gonna

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.240
 get overlooked for promotions so you know ask early on how do I write

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.560
 a good even I'll and what do I need to do to write those evaluations

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.870
 to meet what's being looked at
