WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.010
one of my biggest biggest weakness is that I've made a valiant effort

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.170
 on improving however I still have a lot of work to do in that aspect

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.330
 is Nero I guess you could consider it my time management skills or

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.490
 basically is taking my work home with me a lot of times you know I'll

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.650
 be at work here from the morning till the late afternoon and then

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.800
 I end up taking some of that work home and I'm still working on it at

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.960
 home late at night my family you know is always wondering why am up

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.120
 till ten eleven o'clock working on something like did I do that during

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.280
 the day while I was at work and so it really kind of takes away

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.440
 from that family time and that's a huge weakness of mine that I have

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.600
 is just not being able to separate you know my work life style from

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.760
 my personal and family life and so I've been getting better at that

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.920
 I've actually made certain lakes stoppers where if I find myself at

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.080
 home working on something for work and it's now approaching you know

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.240
 eight or nine o'clock at night and I'm still doing it I I will stop

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.390
 where I'm at and and discontinue that and pick it up on the next

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.550
 day as opposed to continuing to work till ten eleven midnight on something

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.710
 so I'm trying to get better at that but there's definitely a

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.870
 weakness that I have that I feel I'm making improving steps towards

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.030
