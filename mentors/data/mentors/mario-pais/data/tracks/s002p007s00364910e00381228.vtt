WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.010
one of my biggest biggest weakness is that I've made a valiant effort

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.170
 on improving. However, I still have a lot of work to do in that aspect

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.330
 is um, no, I guess you could consider it my time management skills

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.490
 or basically, is taking my work home with me a lot of times. You know,

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.650
 I'll be at work here from the morning till the late afternoon,

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.800
 and then I end up taking some of that work home, and I'm still working

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.960
 on it at home late at night. Uh, my family, you know, it was always

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.120
 wondering why I'm up till 10 11 o'clock working on something like

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.280
 Didn't I do that during the day while I was at work? And so it really

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.440
 kind of takes away from that family time, and that's a huge weakness

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.600
 of mine That I have is just not being able to separate, you know,

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.760
 my work lifestyle from my personal and family life. And so I've been

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.920
 getting better at that. I've actually made certain, like stoppers

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.080
 where if I find myself at home working on something for work and it's

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.240
 now approaching, you know, eight or nine o'clock at night and I'm

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.390
 still doing It will stop where I'm at and discontinue that and pick

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.550
 it up on the next day as opposed to continuing toe work till 10 11

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.710
 Midnight on something. So I'm trying to get better at that. But that

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.870
 is definitely a weakness that I have that I feel I'm making improving

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.030
 steps towards.
