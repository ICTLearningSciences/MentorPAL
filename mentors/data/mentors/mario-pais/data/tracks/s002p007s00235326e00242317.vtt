00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.590
a trick that I use to keep stress from bowling over is, ah, one I'll talk

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.330
 about it, if I am feeling stressed, will either talk about it with

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.070
 the people that I work with or my spouse at home. The other thing

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.810
 is, I just try and find humor in most difficult, stressful situations.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.540
 Ah, even some that you think is risky or stressful. There's usually

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.280
 some sort of underlying humor that you can associate to it, which

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.020
 will lighten the mood and hopefully kind of keep the bring the stress

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.760
 level down.
