00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.120
a trick that I used to keep stress from blowing over is one I'll talk

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.400
 about it if I am feeling stressed either talk about it with the people

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.670
 that I work with or my spouse at home the other thing is I just trying

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.940
 to find humor in the most difficult stressful situations even

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.210
 some that you think is riskier stressful there's usually some sort of

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.490
 underlying humor that you can associate to it which will lighten the

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.760
 mood and hopefully kinda keep bring the stress level down
