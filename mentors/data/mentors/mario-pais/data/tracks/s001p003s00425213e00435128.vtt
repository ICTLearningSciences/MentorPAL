00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.790
I think something that kind of makes the did navy different than other

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.740
 branches is is the uniqueness of some of the job skills that we have

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.680
 and that you'll find there's a lot of different ratings within the

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.620
 navy that have a tendency to be a Jack of all trades you know they

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.570
 have a particular job skill that they were trained to do but as they

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.510
 move from one community to the next or duty station a duty station

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.450
 their roles and responsibilities their technical skills those kind of

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.400
 things improve and and kind of start trickling out and growing tentacles

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.340
 and you start realizing that okay not only do I need to be good

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.280
 at this but I also have to be good at that and you're gonna get train

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.230
 and learn how to do that so I think that's something unique to

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.170
 the navy is the fact that the flexibility in the jobs that you do as

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.110
 well as the adaptive nature and and the asked to be able to do sometimes

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.060
 more than what you were initially trained to do so you have those

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.000
 opportunities to kind of do a variety of different things
