00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.550
I think something that kind of makes the Navy different than other branches

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.240
 is, um, is the uniqueness of some of the job skills that we have

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.940
 that you'll find. There's a lot of different ratings within the Navy

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.640
 that have a tendency to be a jack of all trades. You know, they

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.330
 have a particular job skill that they were trained to do. But as they

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.030
 move from one community, the next or duty station to duty station,

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.730
 their roles and responsibilities, their technical skills, those kind

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.430
 of things improve and and kind of start trickling out and growing

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.120
 tentacles and you start realizing that Okay, not only do I need to be

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.820
 good at this, but I also have to be good at that, and you're gonna

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.520
 get trained and learn how to do that. So I think that's something unique

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.210
 to the Navy. Is the fact that, um, the flexibility and the jobs

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.910
 that you do, as well as the adaptive nature and, um, and the asked

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.610
 to be able to do sometimes more than what you were initially trained

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.300
 to do. So you'll have those opportunities to I kind of do a variety

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.000
 of different things
