00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.300
what I would recommend you do if you're getting ready to live overseas

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.750
 is, you know, research the area that you're gonna be going to. There's

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.200
 plenty of information out there online now where you can kind of

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.650
 understand where you're living, you know, the climate, the things to

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.100
 do in that area, what are considered cultural norms. So things to

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.550
 be aware of and the people that you're gonna be living with because

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.000
 places are very different than it is here in the States. And so some

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.450
 things that we feel are acceptable may not necessarily be like that

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.890
 when you go over there overseas. So you want to kind of do as much

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.340
 research about the area that you're gonna be going to is possible to

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.790
 really prepare yourself as well as if you have a family and they're

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.240
 gonna be going with you overseas. You gotta prepare them as well. So

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.690
 researching the school's what is that curriculum look like? If you've

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.140
 got kids that need to attend school, what kind of things are gonna

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.590
 be there for your spouse to do as far as work? Maybe it's on base

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.040
 or off base. What does she have his career plans, He or she So do as

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.490
 much research as you can before you. You leave for that assignment.
