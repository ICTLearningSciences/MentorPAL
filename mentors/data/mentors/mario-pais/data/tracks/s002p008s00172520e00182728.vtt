what I would recommend you do if you're getting ready to live overseas

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.150
 is no research the area that you're gonna be going to there's plenty

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.810
 of information out there online our you can kind of understand where

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.460
 you're living you know the climb it the things to do in that area

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.110
 what are considered cultural norms of things to be aware of in the

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.760
 people that you're gonna be living with his places are very different

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.420
 than it is here in the states and so some things that we feel are

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.070
 acceptable may not necessarily be like that when you go over there overseas

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.720
