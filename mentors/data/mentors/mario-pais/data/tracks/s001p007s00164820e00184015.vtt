00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.000
so one way that you can, um you build that camaraderie with your team

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.140
 without, you know, cutting close that Fratton ization line. Um, it's

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.290
 a challenge, to say the least, right? It really depends on communities

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.440
 as well. It varies across the board. Some communities are on first

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.580
 name basis with their folks throughout the entire triad, where other

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.730
 communities is very formal and you address them by their title and

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.870
 last name or just title only. So what you have to do is you first

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.020
 gotta figure out what kind of community or you in and what are the

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.170
 community norms and then work to those you know, if you're in a more

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.310
 informal community, you could kind of be looked at in Ostracised is

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.460
 an outsider if you are too formal. If you are in a community where

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.610
 things are no formal and you are becoming a little more informal again,

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.750
 it works that same way. People are gonna look at you a little bit

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.900
 different, not take you seriously, and it's gonna jeopardize your

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.040
 role as a leader. So you got a first kind of figure out what community

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.190
 in my end, and then once you're in that, you know, play to those

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.340
 community norms, but also make sure that the folks that you're leading

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.480
 still understand where that leadership line lays. So sure, you might

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.630
 work side by side with your people. I've even on certain employments.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.780
 I live in the same Ah, how's the same tent establishment with

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.920
 my E three? And I was the senior chief, you know, we all live together

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.070
 in the same community, but there still was that that line that he

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.210
 still knew ultimately that I was I was the leader in charge. But we

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.360
 did have, you know, informal style discussions. And talking together

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.510
 is a platoon. So it's It's a challenge to say. I think the first thing

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.650
 is you got to figure out what kind of community and you are in

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.800
 and what are those community norms and then work to that
