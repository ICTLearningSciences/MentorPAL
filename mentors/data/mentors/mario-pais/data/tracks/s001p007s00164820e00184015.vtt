00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.000
so the one way that you can meal bill that camaraderie with your team

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.140
 without you know cutting close that fraternization line it's it's a

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.290
 challenge to say the least right never it really depends on communities

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.440
 as well it varies across the board some communities are on first

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.580
 name basis with their folks throughout the entire triad weather communities

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.730
 is very formal and your dress them by their title and last

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.870
 name more just title only so what you have to do is you first got to

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.020
 figure out what kind of community are you in and what are the community

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.170
 norms and then work to those you know if you're in a more informal

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.310
 community you could kind of be looked at and ostracized as an outsider

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.460
 if you are too formal if you are in a community where things

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.610
 are you know formal and you were becoming a little more informal get

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.750
 it works that same way people gonna look at you a little bit different

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.900
 not take you seriously and is going to jeopardize your role as a

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.040
 leader so you got a first kind of figure out what community my end

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.190
 and then once you're in that you know play to those community norms

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.340
 but also make sure that the folks at your leading still understand where

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.480
 that leadership line ladies so sure you might work side by side

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.630
 with your people I've even on certain appointments I live in the same

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.780
 house the same tent establishment with my E. three and I was the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.920
 senior chief here we all live together in the same community but there

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.070
 still was that that line that he still knew alternately that I was

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.210
 I was the leader in charge but we did have you know informal style

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.360
 discussions and talking together is a platoon so it's it's it's a challenge

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.510
 to say I think the first thing is you got to figure out what

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.650
 kind of community yet you are in it and what are those community norms

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.800
 and then work to that
