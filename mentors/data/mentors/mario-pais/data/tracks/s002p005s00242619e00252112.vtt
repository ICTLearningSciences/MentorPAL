00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.770
a way that you can tell if you're able to influence someone or whether

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.700
 they're they're just not gonna change is body language is kind of key.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.620
 So let's say that you're trying to get something new across to a

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.540
 group of individuals and, you know, you start noticing that several

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.470
 individuals are nodding their head. Ah, they kind of have a tendency

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.390
 thio agree with you or the providing supporting comments. That's an

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.310
 individual that you can probably influence. It's going to get that

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.240
 buying and help you out. You got other individuals while you're putting

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.160
 out the same information, and their body language is indicative

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.090
 that they're disagreeing arms. Maybe you're crossed. They're not providing

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.010
 you eye contact. They're looking away. That's an individual

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.930
 who is gonna be a little bit more stubborn that you're gonna have to

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.860
 try and maybe convince or work on, uh, who has their heels kind of

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.780
 dug in and is reluctant to to make that change
