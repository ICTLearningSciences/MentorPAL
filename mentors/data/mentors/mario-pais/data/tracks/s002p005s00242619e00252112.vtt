00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.770
the way that you can tell if you're able to influence someone or whether

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.700
 they're you they're just not going to change is body language is

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.620
 kind of key so let's say that you're trying to get something new across

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.540
 to a group of individuals and you know you start noticing that several

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.470
 individuals are nodding their head they they kind of have a tendency

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.390
 to to agree with you or the providing supporting comments that's

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.310
 an individual that you can probably influences gonna get that by

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.240
 in and help you out got other individuals why you're putting out the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.160
 same information and their body language is indicative that they're

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.090
 disagreeing arms maybe crossed their not providing you eye contact

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.010
 they're looking away that's an individual who's going to be a little

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.930
 bit more stubborn that you're gonna have to try maybe convince or

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.860
 work on who has their heels kinda dog in is reluctant to to make that

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.780
 change
