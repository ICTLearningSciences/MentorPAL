00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.020
the way to respond to adapt death odd your commander on ship is you know

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.180
 obviously be respectful about it have have sympathy for those that

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.350
 are Avenue that were maybe close to that individual if you weren't

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.520
 and understand that they're going through some things that they need

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.690
 to get help with and be taken care of if they need to see other resources

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.850
 like counselors or some other site type of support system then

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.020
 you know you need to help them out and deal with that but the biggest

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.190
 thing is just be respectful as well as let the chain of command

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.360
 handled the situation and and don't try and step outside what your

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.520
 job or lateral limits are with posting things on Facebook or social

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.690
 media before the chain of command actually has the opportunity to address

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.860
 the love ones first I've seen that happen before because now we're

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.030
 in this digital age where things can happen instantaneously where

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.190
 somebody was either really hurt or even had died and the family found

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.360
 out about it via social media before the chain of command actually

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.530
 had the opportunity to either show up in person or call them directly

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.700
 and let them know that's definitely the wrong way to go about

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.860
 it so just make sure that it's being handled at the appropriate level

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.030
 and that you're respectful through the entire process
