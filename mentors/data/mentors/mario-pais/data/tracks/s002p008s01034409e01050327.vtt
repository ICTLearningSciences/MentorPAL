00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.810
the way to respond to a depth of death. Uh, your command or on ship is,

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.770
 you know, obviously be respectful about it. Um have have sympathy

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.730
 for those that are having that were maybe close to that individual If

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.690
 you weren't and understand that they're going through some things

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.640
 that they need Thio get help with and be taken care of if they need

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.600
 to see other resource is like counselors or some other type of support

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.560
 system. Then you know you need to help them out and deal with that.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.520
 But the biggest thing is just be respectful as well as let the chain

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.480
 of command handle the situation. And don't try and step outside

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.440
 what your job or lateral limits are with posting things on Facebook

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.400
 or social media before the chain of command actually has the opportunity

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.360
 to address the loved ones first. I've seen that happen before because

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.320
 now we're in this digital age where things can happen instantaneously,

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.280
 where somebody was either really hurt or even had died and

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.230
 the family found out about it via social media before the chain of

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.190
 command actually had the opportunity to either show up in person or

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.150
 called him directly and let them know that is definitely the wrong way

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.110
 to go about it. So let's make sure that it's being handled at the

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.070
 appropriate level and that you're respectful through the entire process.
