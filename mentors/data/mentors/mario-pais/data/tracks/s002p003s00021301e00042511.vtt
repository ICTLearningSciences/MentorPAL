WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.740
so a particular sea story that I can remember. It was actually when I

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.620
 first checked into, um ud mobile unit three, where I was gonna be doing

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.510
 marine mammal handling work. And so I showed up. You know, any four

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.390
 in my dress whites and I checked in, and, you know, the guys were

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.280
 already in the platoon space, like, Oh, you're the new checking I

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.160
 said, Yeah, absolutely. Like, Great. Um, we're going out to see real

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.050
 quick. So here, throw this on and come down out on the boat, and we're

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.930
 gonna go out and work these animals And, you know, I'm standing

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.820
 there with my packet of papers and my dress whites on, and they throw

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.700
 me like some smelly fish smelling close with shorts and a brown T

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.590
 shirt. They found, like, a pair of boots that I could wear and within

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.470
 10 minutes from checking in, uh, in my dress whites I'm wearing, you

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.360
 know, the smelly outfit walking down to where the boats are at to

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.240
 get sea lions on board that we're gonna go work for the day having

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.130
 them dive down to, like, 500 feet, carrying a line to attach to training

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.010
 minds for training these animals. Um, so while we're out there,

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.900
 that's where they, the lpo and the other, the other folks around on

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.790
 the boat, you really start to get to kind of know me. Then we got back

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.670
 there like, All right, go ahead and just shower up. Now you go upstairs

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.560
 and check into admin and get your other stuff ready to go and

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.440
 finish your check in process. I think that was kind of a unique experience.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.330
 There's kind of unconventional from what I heard of how you

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.210
 normally check in when you show up to a new command in the Navy. But

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.100
 I actually enjoyed it that way, looking back on it because it really

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.980
 got an opportunity for me to immediately understand what I was gonna

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.870
 be doing to talk with the folks that were gonna be leading me and

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.750
 the folks I was gonna be working with in kind of a un formal setting.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.640
 And then, you know, step back into the formal setting, put on my

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.520
 dress whites and then go and finish the check in process. I think

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.410
 that's kind of a unique experience, uh, for the Navy and a cultural

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.290
 experience that were very sea driven were very work driven. And so new

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.180
 guy shows up. It's me like, Hey, we're going out on the water to

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.060
 go do some work and then you can worry about the administrative stuff

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.950
 afterwards.
