00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.850
so a particular see story that I can remember was actually when I first

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.860
 checked in to you T. mobile unit three where I was gonna be doing

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.860
 marine mammal handling work and so I showed up you know an E. for in

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.860
 my dress whites and I checked in and you know the guys are already

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.870
 in the platoon space like you're the new check and I said yeah absolutely

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.870
 I like great we're going out to see real quick so here throw this

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.870
 on and come down out of the boat and we're gonna go out and work

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.870
 these animals and now I'm standing there with my packet of papers in

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.880
 my dress whites on and they throw me like some smelly fish smelling

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.880
 close we're shorts and a brown T. shirt they found like a pair of

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.880
 boots that I could wear and within ten minutes from from checking in

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.890
 in my dress whites I'm wearing you know this smelly outfit walking

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.890
 down to where the boats are at to get sea lions on board that we're

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.890
 gonna go work for the day having them dive down to like five hundred

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.900
 feet carrying a line to attach to training mines for for training these

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.900
 animals and so while we're out there that's where they they'll

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.900
 PO in the other the other folks around the boat you really start to

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.900
 get to kinda know me then we got back there like all right go head to

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.910
 shower up now you go upstairs and check into admin and get your other

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.910
 stuff ready to go and finish the check in process I think that was

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.910
 kind of a unique experiences kind of unconventional from what I heard

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.920
 of how you normally check in when you show up to a new command

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.920
 in the navy I actually enjoyed it that way looking back on it because

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.920
 it really got an opportunity for me to immediately understand what

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.930
 I was going to be doing to talk with the folks that we're gonna be

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.930
 leading me in the folks I was gonna be working with in kind of a on

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.930
 formal setting and then you step back into the formal setting put on

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.930
 my dress whites then go and finish the check in process I think that's

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.940
 kind of a unique experience the the for the navy in a cultural experience

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.940
 that were very C. driven were very work driven and so new

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.940
 guy shows up it's me like Hey we're going out on the water to go do

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.950
 some work and then you can worry about the administrative stuff afterwards

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.950
