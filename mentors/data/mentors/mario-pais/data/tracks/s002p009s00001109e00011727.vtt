00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.740
one of the new administrative tasks that you'll have to do is a leader

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.640
 is, Ah, figure out what it is you're leading. You know? Why are you

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.530
 in the position that you are? So you need to understand fully what

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.420
 your job is? That's probably going to require you to read several documents,

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.310
 several guiding principles said. You can fully understand what

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.210
 your job is and how you're helping out the organization as a whole.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.100
 And then the other administrative task that you're gonna deal with

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.990
 as a new leader is just understanding your people. So probably having

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.890
 to get into their records and research what their background is,

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.780
 what kind of previous training they already have, what areas maybe

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.670
 they need to get trained on based on the job and assignments that they're

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.570
 now gonna be doing. You're gonna also have to be recording their

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.460
 successes and failures when it comes time for evaluation periods

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.350
 and helping out with writing their evils. So some of the very first

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.240
 task you're gonna have is understanding your people on understanding

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.140
 your job, and you know we do that is reading and getting educated

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.030
 in those areas
