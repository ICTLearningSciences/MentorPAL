00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.700
being the military, you still pay taxes. A lot of folks are under a misconception

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.550
 that you don't pay taxes. When you're in the military, you

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.400
 absolutely do. You'll find those things on your W two form that you're

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.240
 able to access on. Look at any time on the my pay website and

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.090
 you need to file your taxes just like anybody else files their taxes

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.940
 by the deadline. That's due one advantage that you do have about being

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.790
 in the military when it comes to. Filing your taxes, though, is

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.640
 if you're on deployment during that tax season time frame and you're

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.490
 unable to make those taxes or pay those on time or file your taxes,

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.330
 you're given kind of, ah 180 day buffer to get your taxes turned in

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.180
 after the date that most everyone else has to have their taxes done.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.030
 Another advantage is if you're deployed to a non taxable region, then

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.880
 you're not actually taxed on your paycheck while you're there. And

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.730
 so, at the end of the year, when you're filing your taxes, you'll

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.580
 notice that you'll be in a lot a lot less. You'll be in a lower tax

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.420
 bracket because the income that you earned while you're deployed away

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.270
 fromthe states. You weren't being taxed on that and you won't be

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.120
 taxed on that. So that's kind of those two advantages that you have

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.970
 when it comes to taxes and being in the Navy.
