00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.700
be in the military you still pay taxes a lot of folks are under a misconception

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.550
 that you don't pay taxes when you're in the military you absolutely

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.400
 do you'll find those things on your W. two form that you're

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.240
 able to access and look at any time on the mypay website and you need

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.090
 to file your taxes just like anybody else files are taxes by the

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.940
 deadline that's do one advantage that you do have about being in the

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.790
 military when it comes to filing your taxes though is if you're on

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.640
 deployment during that tax season time frame you're unable to make

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.490
 those taxes or pay those on time to file your taxes you're given kind

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.330
 of a hundred eighty day buffer to get your taxes turned in after the

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.180
 date that most everyone else has to have their taxes done another

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.030
 advantage is if you're deployed to a non taxable region then you're

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.880
 not actually taxing your paycheck while you're there and so at the

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.730
 end of the year when you're filing your taxes you'll notice that you'll

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.580
 be in a little a lot less could be in a lower tax bracket because

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.420
 the income that you earn well you're deployed away from the states

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.270
 you weren't being taxed on that and you won't be taxed on that so it's

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.120
 kind of those are one two advantages that you have when it comes

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.970
 to taxes and being in the navy
