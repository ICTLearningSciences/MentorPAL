00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.460
the the first thing that you've got to do if you're trying to write an

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.070
 evaluation on somebody who's really deserving he first got to figure

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.690
 out who's the audience that you're writing this for and he's gonna

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.300
 be looking at it because different audiences there be reading this

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.910
 evaluation are gonna be looking for different things as well as where

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.520
 that person is actually in their career you know an individual who's

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.130
 any for their certain expectations that they should be achieving

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.750
 certain Qualls qualifications are milestones at that level as any for

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.360
 as opposed to when somebody's saying E. six they should probably already

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.970
 have certain things achieved now we're looking at them a little

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.580
 bit differently so you need to understand who your audience is that

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.200
 your writing this evil for and right to that you know is as a junior

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.810
 person that you're writing on someone who's probably need three

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.420
 E. for even the five you know it's probably more technical base that

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.030
 you're writing their valuations on how are they doing in their job

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.640
 how are they improving technically as well as some other leadership

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.260
 skills as an individual moved up in rank and now you're writing east

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.870
 sixty thousand chief he vows and hire new what's most important now

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.480
 is how are they leading are they having an impact on the command in

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.090
 the navy as a whole and how are they professionally developing their

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.700
 subordinates and where the achievements of their subordinates so in

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.320
 in a leadership position no your success is derived directly from

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.930
 your subordinates success so if your subordinates aren't being successful

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.540
 in your family as a leader and so the way that you can show that

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.150
 any valuation time is by you know making sure that those things are

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.770
 captured in those people's evaluations as well as making sure that

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.380
 you're writing the writing the eve al to the level of the audience

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.990
 is going to be looking at it
