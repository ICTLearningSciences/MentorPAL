00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.340
the first thing that you've got to do if you're trying to write an evaluation

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.830
 on somebody who's really deserving is you first. Gotta figure

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.310
 out who's the audience that you're writing this four and who's gonna

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.800
 be looking at it because different audiences they're gonna be reading

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.290
 this evaluation are gonna be looking for different things as well

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.780
 as where that person is actually in their career. You know, an individual

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.260
 who's any four. There's certain expectations that they should

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.750
 be achieving certain qualities. Qualifications or milestones at that

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.240
 level is any four is opposed to when somebody's saying EA six, they

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.730
 should probably already have certain things achieved. Now we're

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.210
 looking at them a little bit differently. So you need to understand

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.700
 who your audience is that you're writing this evil for and right to

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.190
 that, a za junior person that you're writing on someone who's probably

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.680
 any three e four, even he five. You know, it's probably more technical

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.160
 base that you're writing their evaluations on. How are they doing

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.650
 in their job? How are they improving technically, as well as some

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.140
 of their leadership skills as that individual moves up in rank, and

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.630
 now you're writing East. Sexy vows and chief, he vows, and higher.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.110
 You know, what's most important now is how are they leading? How are

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.600
 they having an impact on the command and the Navy is a whole? And

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.090
 how are they professionally developing their subordinates and where

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.580
 the achievements of their subordinates. So in a leadership position,

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.060
 you know your success is derived directly from your subordinates success.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.550
 So if your subordinates aren't being successful than you're failing

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.040
 as a leader. And so the way that you can show that an evaluation

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.530
 time is by making sure that those things were captured in those

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.010
 people's evaluations, as well as making sure that you're writing the

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.500
 writing, the evil to the level of the audience is gonna be looking

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.990
 at it.
