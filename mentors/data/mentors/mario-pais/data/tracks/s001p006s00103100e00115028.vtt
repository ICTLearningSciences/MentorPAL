00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.810
so what I do now that's different than what I thought I was going to be

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.780
 doing is not originally joined the navy to come in to be a navy seal

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.740
 and during that time you actually had to pick a source rating before

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.710
 you can go on to seal training so I asked the the detailer that

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.670
 was there at maps you know what's the short is a school you have because

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.640
 I have no intention on doing it and he said Hey all maintenance

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.600
 technician so I asked what's that it's welding okay yeah I give it

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.570
 to me I'll do that short school so went through boot camp when on my

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.530
 following a school for whole maintenance technician and welding and

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.490
 then went on to bud's where I didn't make it all the way through the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.460
 program so I ended up having to become a whole means technician where

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.420
 I ended up actually moving on to io de is my first command in doing

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.390
 marine mammal handling and working in that aspect and because of

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.350
 the job that I had done initially with the EOD I've actually been managed

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.320
 to maintain an entire career within this community and never

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.280
 really have actually worked within the whole maintenance tech job so

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.250
 you know originally came in to be a CEO and then all maintenance technician

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.210
 as a secondary platform and now here I am a senior chief in

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.180
 the navy that actually uses on man underwater vehicles to do mine countermeasures

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.140
 for the navy as a whole
