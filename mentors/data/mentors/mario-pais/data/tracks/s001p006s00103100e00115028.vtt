00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.630
So what I do now that's different than what I thought I was gonna be doing

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.400
 is originally joined the Navy to come in to be a Navy SEAL. And

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.180
 during that time, you actually had to pick a source rating before you

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.950
 could go on to seal training. So I asked, Ah, the detailer that was

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.730
 there at maps, you know, what's the shortest a school you have? Because

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.500
 I have no intention on doing it. And he said, Hey, all maintenance

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.280
 technician. So I asked, What's that? Oh, it's welding. Okay, Yeah,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.060
 Give it to me. I'll do that short school. So went through boot

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.830
 camp, went on in my following a school for home maintenance technician

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.610
 and welding, and then went on to buds where I didn't make it all

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.380
 the way through the program. So I ended up having to become a whole

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.160
 maintenance technician where I ended up. Actually, moving on to E. O.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.930
 D. Is my first command and doing marine mammal handling and working

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.710
 in that aspect and because of the job that I had done initially with

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.490
 E o. D. Have actually been managed to maintain an entire career within

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.260
 this community, and never really have actually worked within the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.040
 whole maintenance tech jobs. So, you know, originally came in to

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.810
 be a seal and then haul maintenance technician is a secondary platform.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.590
 And now here I am senior chief in the Navy that actually uses unmanned

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.360
 underwater vehicles to do mine countermeasures for the Navy as

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.140
 a whole.
