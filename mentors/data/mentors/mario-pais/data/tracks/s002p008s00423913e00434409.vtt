00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.910
when to worry about retirement or at least start thinking about it ought

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.970
 to be somewhere you know in your career could be early on it really

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.030
 just depends on what your overall goal is if you know that you want

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.090
 to make a career of the navy and you intend on doing a full twenty

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.150
 years then you've already started thinking about that early in your

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.210
 working towards those steps if you're for if you're at that middle

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.270
 point usually you're you've done ten years and now you're trying to

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.330
 decide to I do another ten to make a career in retired should I get

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.390
 out now well then you wanna have been thinking about that prior to

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.450
 hitting that ten year mark though if you made it past that then as you're

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.510
 getting kind of closer to those retirement time frames that's

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.570
 when you really need to start thinking about it and preparing there's

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.630
 different resources out there in training in schools at the navy offers

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.690
 to get you ready for retirement that you'll go to or do online

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.750
 so it really just depends on where you're at in your stage of your

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.810
 career and we need to really start thinking about those things
