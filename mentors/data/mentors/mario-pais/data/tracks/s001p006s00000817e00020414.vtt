00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.850
so one story that I can think of that really shows what its like working

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.850
 on my job is is a story that kind of has to do with innovation and

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.850
 outside the box thinking which we commonly have to do in the E. O.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.850
 D. community here one of which was we had a particular piece of gear

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.840
 one of our you you vis which is about twelve feet in length and weighs

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.840
 about six hundred pounds and it's really been tied to launching

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.840
 recovering from an eleven meter read and these eleven meter ribs you

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.840
 can only move them in theater from one place to another based on particular

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.840
 err strategically for choir miss that are there it's very

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.840
 difficult to kind of get aircraft that you can fit an eleven meter ribbons

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.840
 side so we thought outside the box and figured how can we move

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.840
 this piece of equipment using the most smallest platform that we have

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.840
 in our arsenal which is a very small combat rubber rating crafter

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.840
 creek so this was out on deployment and we found kind of a construction

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.830
 site that had some left over plywood and foam and we basically

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.830
 developed a sled device that we were able to pull this vehicle up on

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.830
 two in tow behind our smallest platformer smallest creek that had

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.830
 just a thirty five horsepower engine and still be able to be combat

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.830
 effective and deploy the equipment searching for mines all across the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.830
 theater so from that are admiral happened actually see what we have

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.830
 developed out of wood and phone Khan and got nicknamed the spruce

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.830
 goose and later he actually funded a program to develop a more robust

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.830
 proto type and here we are five years later we actually have eighteen

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.830
 of these operational prototypes being worked right now they've gone

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.820
 through several different iterations and there now part of the X.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.820
 MCM companies tower table of allowances and they deploy with these

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.820
 things that provide us an opportunity to basically get to where we

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.820
 need to without being strong arm to using the eleven meter crew of red

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.820
