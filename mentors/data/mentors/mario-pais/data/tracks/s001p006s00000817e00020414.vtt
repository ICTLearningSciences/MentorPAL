00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.990
So one story that I can think of that really shows what it's like working

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.130
 in my job is Ah is a story that kind of has to do with innovation

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.280
 and outside the box thinking, which we commonly have to do in the

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.420
 e o. D. Community here. Ah, one of which was we had a particular piece

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.560
 of gear, one of our U. U V s, which is about 12 feet in length and

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.700
 weighs about Â£600 and it's really been tied to launch in recovering

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.840
 from an 11 meter rib and these 11 meter ribs, you can only move them

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.980
 in theatre from one place to another, based on particular air strategic

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.130
 lift requirements that air there. It's very difficult to kind

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.270
 of get aircraft that you can fit in 11 meter rib inside. So we thought

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.410
 outside the box and figured, How can we move this piece of equipment

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.550
 using the most smallest platform that we have in our arsenal, which

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.690
 is a very small combat rubber rating craft or creek? So this was

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.840
 out on deployment and we've found kind of a construction site that

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.980
 had some leftover plywood and foam, and we basically developed a sled

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.120
 device that we were able to pull this vehicle up onto and tow behind

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.260
 our smallest platform, our smallest creek that had just a 35 horsepower

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.400
 engine and still be able to be combat effective and deploy the

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.540
 equipment searching for mines all across the theater. So from that

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.690
 our admiral happened, actually see what we had developed out of wood

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.830
 and foam, and it kind of got nicknamed the Spruce Goose, and later

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.970
 he actually funded a program to develop a more robust prototype. And

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.110
 here we are. Five years later, we actually have 18 of these operational

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.250
 prototypes being worked. Right now, they've gone through several

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.390
 different generations, and they're now part of the X m. C. M Cos

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.540
 tore table of allowances. And they deploy with these things that provide

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.680
 us an opportunity to basically get to where we need to without

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.820
 being strongarm to using the 11 meter rib
