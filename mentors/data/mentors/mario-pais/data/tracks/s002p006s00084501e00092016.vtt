00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.760
I think one person that I do admire the most would probably be President

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.660
 John F. Kennedy. I think him having been, you know, a navel naval

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.570
 person himself and served in the service. And then a lot of the great

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.470
 work that he was he was doing towards moving the country forward

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.380
 with some of the difficulties that we're having with, you know, civil

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.280
 rights and the war that we were getting and a lot of the organizations

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.190
 that he built up, including that of what is now a special warfare.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.090
 He's responsible for kind of creating that avenue. Um, he's somebody

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.000
 that I admire.
