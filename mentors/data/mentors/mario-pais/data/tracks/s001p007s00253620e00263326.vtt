00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.930
certain skills that I wish I had mastered before it started was probably

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.000
 administrative skills so you earlier on in my career I was very good

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.080
 at the technical aspect of the operating aspect it wasn't until

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.150
 I really moved on to recruiting duty where I really had a hard look

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.230
 at my administrative skills because at that time we still kind of hand

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.300
 wrote contracts out and there was a lot of pages with that and if

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.380
 you made a single clerical error you had to kind of start all over

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.460
 again with the paperwork in so doing for years a recruiting duty will

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.530
 definitely make you blot better your ministry of side and so I wish

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.610
 I kind of had known that earlier on because it would save me a lot

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.680
 of late nights and a lot of do overs with paperwork and things like

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.760
 that as I moved on to having to be more straight administratively sound

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.830
 as I moved up in leadership positions and and my career as a whole

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.910
