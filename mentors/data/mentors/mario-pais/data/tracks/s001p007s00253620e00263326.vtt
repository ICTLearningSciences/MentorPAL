00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.930
certain skills that I wish that I had mastered before I had started, um,

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.000
 was probably administrative skills. So, you know, earlier on in my

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.080
 career I was very good at the technical aspect and the operating aspect.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.150
 It wasn't until I really moved on to recruiting duty where I

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.230
 really I had a hard look at my administrative skills because at that

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.300
 time we still kind of hand wrote contracts out and there was a lot

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.380
 of pages with that. And if you made a single clerical error, you had

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.460
 to kind of start all over again with the paperwork. And so doing four

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.530
 years of recruiting duty will definitely make you a lot better at

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.610
 your administrative side. And so I wish I had kind of had known that

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.680
 earlier on, because it would have saved me a lot of late nights and

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.760
 a lot of do overs with paperwork and things like that, as I have moved

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.830
 on to having to be more strata administratively sound as I moved

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.910
 up in leadership positions and my career is a hole
