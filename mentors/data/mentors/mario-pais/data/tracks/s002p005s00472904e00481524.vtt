00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.400
so the way that I deliver bad news, a cz an example, like a family emergencies.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.960
 I'm definitely direct with the person. I don't try and dance

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.510
 around what the issue is. Obviously, if it's something that's a personal

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.070
 issue that the person needs to be aware of, such as a family

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.620
 emergency, I'm gonna pull that individual aside and somewhere quiet

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.170
 where just the two of us could discuss the issue. But I'm not gonna

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.730
 dance around. I'm going to get right to it and say, Hey, listen, just

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.280
 got a phone call. Such and such has happened. Um, you know, here's

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.830
 what we're gonna be able to do for you. What do you need help with

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.390
 and how can we make this happen? But the easiest way when it comes

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.940
 to bad news is just be direct and don't try and sugar coat it. I think

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.500
 people appreciate that because it able to get to the issue right

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.050
 away.
