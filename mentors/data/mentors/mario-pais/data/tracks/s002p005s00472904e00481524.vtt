00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.700
so the way that I deliver bad news as an example like a family emergencies

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.550
 I'm definitely direct with the person I don't try and dance around

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.400
 with the issue is obviously if it's something that's a personal

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.250
 issue that the person is to be aware of such as a family emergency when

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.100
 a poll that individual aside and somewhere quiet we're just the

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.950
 two of us can discuss the issue but I'm not going to dance around I'm

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.800
 going to get right to it and say Hey listen just got a phone call

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.650
 such and such happened you know here's what we're gonna be able to do

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.500
 for you what do you need help with and how can we make this happen

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.350
 but the easiest way when it comes to bad news is just be direct and

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.200
 don't try and sugar coat it I think people appreciate that because

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.050
 able to get to the issue right away
