00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.310
what else do you need to know while well let's talk one thing I think

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.760
 you you can take away is you know as a leader do not be afraid to fail

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.220
 that's okay because you learn from your failures and at least you

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.680
 put forth an effort and you tried and you kind of discovered what maybe

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.130
 your limits are and then you can figure out how to improve those

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.590
 limits so you know it's okay to fail you fail fast but then win big

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.050
 and come back from that and overcome that failure and and continue

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.500
 to keep trying and and being innovative in pushing the envelope but

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.960
 you just you can't be afraid to fail
