00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.310
What else do you need to know? Wow. Well, let's do. One thing I think

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.760
 you can take away is, you know, as a leader, do not be afraid to fail.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.220
 That's okay, because you learn from your failures. Ah, and at least

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.680
 you put forth an effort and you tried, and you kind of discovered

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.130
 what may be your limits are. And then you can figure out how to improve

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.590
 those limits. So, you know, it's okay to fail, you fail fast, but

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.050
 then win big and come back from that and overcome that failure. And,

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.500
 ah, and continue to keep trying and and being innovative and pushing

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.960
 the envelope. But you just you can't be afraid to fail.
