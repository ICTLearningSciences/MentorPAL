00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.860
one way that you can develop your interpersonal skills. Working with a

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.860
 team be a better teammate, is ah, is improving your level of communication,

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.870
 not just how you are able to get your responses across, but

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.870
 also just listening to others. And you really have to listen. A lot

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.880
 of times people, when they're being talked to, they're in their own

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.880
 minds, kind of thinking what they already want to say to that question

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.890
 or what their response is gonna be. And when you do that, you really

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.890
 aren't fully listening to what the other person is saying because

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.900
 you're more inside your own head trying to kind of figure out what

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.910
 you're going to say next. Um and you can miss a lot. So one of things

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.910
 you could do with your interpersonal communication skills is just

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.920
 truly listen like don't be in your own head trying to figure out what

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.920
 you're going to say next. But listen to what's being said. And if

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.930
 you have to take a moment to pause and then start thinking that's

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.930
 okay, because then you fully listen to what those other teammates had

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.940
 to say. You're going provide a much better response to that question

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.940
 or the overall conversation, which is gonna propel that team in a

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.950
 in a Ford direction
