00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.570
to write an evaluation a sailor who's having problems but is still useful

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.280
 is you just again have to be honest in your writing you can't you

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.000
 know trying sugar coat things or use flowery wording or adjectives

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.720
 to get around the issue hopefully you've been doing your job as a leader

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.430
 anyway and I've been mentor in that person along the way and telling

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.150
 them early on that they've been having issues and I've identified

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.870
 those trying to have them fix them June wait till you Val time

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.580
 to now drop the bomb on on that they haven't been performing the way

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.300
 that you've expected over the last year you know if you're doing that

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.020
 shame on you as a leader you need to have gotten with that person

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.730
 early on to fix it let's assume that you have done that and they still

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.450
 you know aren't dubbed the best or are having issues but they're

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.170
 still workable we'll talk to that in the evaluation not everyone can

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.880
 be the shining star not everyone's going to have that really promote

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.600
 evaluation some people have to be promoted bowl and that's just the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.320
 reality of things they're still worth keeping around they still can

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.030
 do the job but they're just not necessarily ready for that next next

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.750
 line of responsibility or that next line of being promoted and that's

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.470
 just the reality of things you have to be honest in your reporting

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.180
 when you're writing evaluation and you have to be honest when you're

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.900
 mentoring and counseling your people
