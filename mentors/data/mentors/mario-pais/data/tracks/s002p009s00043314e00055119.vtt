00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.400
to write an evaluation on Sailor who's having problems, but it's still

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.950
 useful is you just again have to be honest in your writing. You can't,

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.490
 uh, you know, try and sugarcoat things or use flowery wording or

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.040
 adjectives to get around the issue. Hopefully, you've been doing your

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.590
 job as a leader anyway and have been mentoring that person along

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.140
 the way and telling them early on that they've been having issues and

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.680
 have identified those to try and have them fix them. You didn't wait

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.230
 till evil time to now drop the bomb on them that they haven't been

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.780
 performing the way that you've expected over the last year. You know,

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.330
 if you're doing that, shame on you. As a leader, you need to have

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.880
 gotten with that person early on to fix it. But let's assume that

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.420
 you have done that and they still, you know, aren't the the best or

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.970
 having issues. But they're still workable. We'll talk to that in the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.520
 evaluation. Not everyone can be the Shining Star. Not everyone's gonna

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.070
 have that early promote evaluation. Some people have to be promotable,

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.610
 and that's just the reality of things. There's still worth keeping

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.160
 around they still can do the job, but they're just not necessarily

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.710
 ready for that next next line of responsibility or that next line

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.260
 of being promoted. And that's just the reality of things. You have

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.800
 to be honest in your reporting when you're writing evaluation, and

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.350
 you have to be honest when you're mentoring and counseling your people.
