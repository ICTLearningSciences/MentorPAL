00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.550
so some problems that you need thio understand early or else you could

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.250
 possibly have issues with them later on is your logistical requirements.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.960
 Um, as far as you know, what resource is, do you have? And if

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.660
 you don't identify where your shortfalls are in your resource is that's

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.360
 gonna play a part in what your overall mission success is as well

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.060
 as gonna play a part in the mission success of your personnel that

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.760
 you're leading. If you're missing those of those resource is and you

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.460
 don't identify them early and well, we all understand that. You know,

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.170
 things kind of take time, even if I under even if identify a shortfall

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.870
 right now in my resource is it could take anywhere from 36 months

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.570
 a year longer until maybe I see something back from that shortfall.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.270
 So if identify that early now, then hopefully that will catch up

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.970
 to when I actually needed and having those resource is identified

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.680
 will then allow me to move forward in the direction of my personnel

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.380
 as well as moving forward in the direction of the mission requirements
