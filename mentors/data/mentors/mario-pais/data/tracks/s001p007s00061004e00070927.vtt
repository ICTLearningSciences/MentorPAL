00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.800
so some problems that you need to understand early or else you could possibly

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.750
 have issues with them later on is your logistical requirements

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.700
 as far as you know what resources do you have and if you don't identify

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.640
 where your shortfalls are your resources that's going to play

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.590
 a part in what your overall mission successes as well as in a play

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.540
 a part in the mission success of your personnel that you're leading

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.490
 if you're missing those of those resources and you don't identify them

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.440
 early and we'll all we all understand that you know things kinda

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.390
 take time even if I under even if identify a shortfall right now in

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.340
 my resources it could take anywhere from three six months a year longer

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.290
 until maybe I see something back from that shortfall of identify

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.230
 that early now then hopefully that'll catch up to when I actually needed

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.180
 and having those resources identified well then allow me to move

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.130
 forward in the direction of my personnel as well as moving forward

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.080
 in the direction of the mission requirements
