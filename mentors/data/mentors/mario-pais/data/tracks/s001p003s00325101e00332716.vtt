I think we can encourage accountability is making sure that everyone that's

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.080
 working on that team knows that their their work is valued their

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.700
 opinions are valued and that the work that they're doing has merit

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.310
 if you have that buy in from everyone on the team and they're working

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.930
 together as a team people are gonna have a tendency to not only

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.540
 be accountable for themselves but they're gonna hold others accountable

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.160
 as well because they don't want the team more and or the mission

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.770
 to fail and the way you do that is by establishing that value in the

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.390
 work that they're doing as an individual and as a team as a whole

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.000
