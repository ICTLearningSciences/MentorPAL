I think what can encourage accountability is making sure that everyone

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.080
 that's working on that team knows that their, uh their work is valued,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.700
 Their opinions are valued and that the work that they're doing has

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.310
 merit. If you have that buy in from everyone on the team and they're

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.930
 working together as a team, people are gonna have a tendency to

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.540
 not only be accountable for themselves, but they're gonna hold others

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.160
 accountable as well, because they don't want the team or and or the

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.770
 mission to fail. And the way you do that is by establishing that value

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.390
 in the work that they're doing as an individual and as a team as

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.000
 a whole.
