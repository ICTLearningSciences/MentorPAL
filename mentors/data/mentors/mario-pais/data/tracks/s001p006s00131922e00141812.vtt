00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.780
so within my career I've had to move several times and it didn't Kerr

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.700
 some changes for that personally with my family and and those kind of

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.630
 things I've had to move from the west coast to the east coast back

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.560
 to the west coast again when I've made deployment some actually going

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.480
 out of country for you know six to seven months at a time and that

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.410
 that kind of takes a toll on you personally as well as what do you

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.340
 have to deal with with your family so I've been able to you know move

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.260
 my family to live back home with family and friends there's a support

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.190
 unit when I've been on deployments and then of course moving back

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.120
 and forth from coast to coast I have a tendency to where I will go

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.040
 out first he kind of establish that residency and get all of our household

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.970
 goods moved in and everything set up before I finally move

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.900
 my wife and kids out to to live in that home so it's some more easier

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.820
 transition for them to do and I kind of take on all the the heavy

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.750
 lifting in that aspect
