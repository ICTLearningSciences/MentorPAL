00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.780
So with in my career, I've had to move several times. Andi, it did incur

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.700
 some changes for that personally, with my family and those kind of

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.630
 things, I've had to move from the West Coast to the East Coast, back

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.560
 to the West Coast again when I've made deployments that I'm actually

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.480
 going out of country for 6 to 7 months at a time. And, uh, that

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.410
 kind of takes a toll on you personally as well as what you have to deal

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.340
 with with your family. So, um, I've been able to move my family

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.260
 to live back home with family and friends. There is a support unit when

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.190
 I've been on deployments on then, of course, moving back and forth

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.120
 from coast to coast. I have a tendency to where I will go out first

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.040
 and kind of establish that residency and get over. Our household

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.970
 goods moved in and everything set up before I finally move. My wife

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.900
 and kids out toe toe live in that home. So it's a more easier transition

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.820
 for them to dio, and I kind of take on all the heavy lifting in

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.750
 that aspect.
