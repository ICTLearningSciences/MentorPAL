00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.170
one way that's helped me to understand my my boss my superiors is to find

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.490
 a time to sit down with them and and go over what their expectations

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.810
 are and where we fit into the overall commands mission objectives

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.130
 lot of times as best done over lunch and sometimes I'll be the one

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.450
 to initiate that office all set up a time asking Hey would be good

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.760
 if if you and I can get together over lunch at such and such date and

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.080
 times that we can discuss you know where we're going with this department

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.400
 or division where you want to lead it and what our expectations

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.720
 are of one another and and that kind of takes you out of of of

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.040
 formal setting and put you in a more informal one where people have

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.360
 a tendency to open up and be a little more communicated and I've found

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.680
 that that's kind of work the best for me
