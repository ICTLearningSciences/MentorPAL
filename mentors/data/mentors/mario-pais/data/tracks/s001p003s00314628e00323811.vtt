00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.840
one way that's helped me to understand my my boss and my superiors is

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.820
 to find a time to sit down with them and and go over what their expectations

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.810
 are and where we fit into the overall commands, mission and

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.800
 objectives. A lot of times that's best done over lunch. Um, and sometimes

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.780
 I'll be the one to initiate that off. I'll set up a time and

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.770
 ask him, Hey, would it be good if you and I could get together over

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.760
 lunch at such and such day in times that we can discuss, You know where

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.750
 we're going with this department or division and where you want

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.730
 to lead it and what our expectations are of one another. And, um and

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.720
 that kind of takes you out of a formal setting and put you in a more

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.710
 informal one, where people have a tendency to open up and be a little

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.690
 more communicative. And I've found that that's kind of work the

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.680
 best for me
