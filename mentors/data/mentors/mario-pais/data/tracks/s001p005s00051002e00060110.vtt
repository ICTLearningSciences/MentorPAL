00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.780
so the decisions that I make on a daily basis can very based on the situation

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.710
 at hand right so for example as the L. C. P. O. of the U. M.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.640
 S. division there's times I have to deal with the sailors personal

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.570
 and professional development for example a sailor might come in and

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.500
 say that he have it he's having family issues or needs to get his wife's

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.430
 car registered how to go about doing that so I got to help him

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.350
 out with that it piece of work then other times I might be getting tasking

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.280
 from our Commodore even our admiral it Thaicom that's wanting

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.210
 to see where we're moving for with developing certain programs for

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.140
 the E. U. D. community especially the X. M. C. M. communion mine countermeasures

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.070
 so it varies from some of the very small minute personal

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.000
 face to face things all the way up to higher level examples working

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.930
 with Commodores and had admirals across the force
