00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.780
so the decisions that I make on a daily basis convey very based on the

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.710
 situation at hand, right? So, for example, as the LCP o of the U. S.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.640
 Division, there's times that I have to deal with the sailors personal

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.570
 and professional development. For example, a sailor might come in

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.500
 and say that he has. He's having family issues or needs to get his

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.430
 wife's car registered. How does he go about doing that? So I gotta

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.350
 help him out with that A piece of work then Other times I might be getting

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.280
 tasking from our Commodore, even our admiral, a TyCom that's

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.210
 wanting to see where we're moving forward with developing certain programs

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.140
 for the U. D community, especially the X m, c m community and

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.070
 mine countermeasures. So it varies from some of the very small minute

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.000
 personal face to face things all the way up to a higher level of

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.930
 examples working with Commodores and had admirals across the force
