00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.460
so some counseling skills that I've used that have helped me out throughout

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.060
 my career on a lot of it. I learned when I was on recruiting duty

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.670
 because you're basically meeting people for the first time and having

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.280
 to convince them that join the Navy is in their best interest.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.880
 It's an intangible product, and you're essentially selling it to them.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.490
 It's not something they can take home. They have to believe in what

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.100
 you're saying and believe in you, and so that kind of help me out

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.700
 with buildings, some of my counselor skills. And so I found that,

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.310
 you know, being ableto listen and you listen well and kind of ask probing

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.920
 questions to get behind that need or get behind. You know what

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.520
 that surface value is because there's always something underlying there.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.130
 That's something you want to try and get to. The only way you

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.740
 can do that is through listening well and then asking questions that

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.340
 kind of will elicit open ended responses to your questions that you

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.950
 ask
