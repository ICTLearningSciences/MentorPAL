if you have trouble listening well some strategies that you can do is

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.140
 get out of your own head you effective communication there's a difference

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.780
 between a conversation and communication no communication is being

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.430
 able to actually sit and listen to what the other person is saying

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.070
 without being in your own head trying to figure out what you're

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.720
 going to say next because then you're gonna miss certain things that

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.360
 that person is telling you so one step and you can do is if you find

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.010
 yourself when somebody's talking but you're in your own head trying

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.650
 to figure out how you're going to continue to keep the conversation

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.300
 going or what you're gonna try and say next just stop stop trying

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.940
 to clear your mind and listen to what the person saying and also just

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.590
 be honest a lot of times when waiting to get past your own personal

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.230
 flaws is to let other people know that you have those flaws you can

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.880
 tell that individual you know what I'm sorry I was half listening

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.520
 to what you're saying if you wouldn't mind could you please repeat it

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.170
 so that I can I can hear you a little bit better and we can continue

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.810
