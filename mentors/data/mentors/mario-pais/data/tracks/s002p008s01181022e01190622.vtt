one way that you can encourage people to talk about suicide or thought

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.320
 that they might be having is making sure that you've already foster

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.050
 that kind of culture within your organization that they understand

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.780
 it's okay to get help it's okay to talk to other people about these

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.520
 thoughts that they're having because there are support networks out

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.250
 there that they're not gonna be ostracized if they start bringing these

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.980
 type of thoughts or ideas up and that there's a support network

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.720
 for them and the only way to do that is by already lane that groundwork

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.450
 down that Hey you know just because you're thinking this way that's

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.180
 not uncommon there's a lot of people that have those type of thoughts

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.920
 some people even go through an act on those thoughts but before

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.650
 that actually happens know that it's okay for you to come and talk

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.380
 to somebody about it and that we have the support network to get you

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.120
 through that so you have to kind of lay that groundwork early on that

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.850
 it's okay to talk about and to get help
