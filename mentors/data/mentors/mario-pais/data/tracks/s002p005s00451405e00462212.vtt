00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.630
So what you can do if you're given an impossible situation and you're

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.410
 dealing with failures that you didn't cause is you still need to figure

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.190
 out Are you ultimately the one that's responsible? If you are the

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.980
 one that's responsible, then you still got to take ownership in that

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.760
 As hard as that pill is to swallow, you're responsible for the outcome

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.540
 of that situation in that mission. And so you need to take ownership

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.320
 of it, even if the failures necessarily weren't yours. Um, if

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.100
 it's something that was completely out of your control and you obviously

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.880
 need to bring that up to your chain of command and show the steps

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.670
 that you took to try and achieve this impossible mission and make

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.450
 it a reality and those factors that you we're out of your control,

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.230
 that caused you to fail but also to you wanna limit the amount of blame

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.010
 that you're putting on outside organizations or outside factors

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.790
 because at the end, you're still probably the one that's ultimate responsibly

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.570
 need to own that. So you're gonna have to walk around that

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.360
 very delicately, and ah, and figure out you know how you convey that

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.140
 measures to your superiors without placing blame on somebody else.
