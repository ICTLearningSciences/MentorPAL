00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.850
so what you can do if you're given an impossible situation and you're

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.860
 dealing with failures that you didn't cause is you still need to figure

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.860
 out are you alternately the one that's responsible if you are the

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.870
 one that's responsible then you still gotta take ownership in that

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.870
 as hard as that pill is to swallow you're responsible for the outcome

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.870
 of that situation in that mission and so you need to take ownership

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.880
 of it even if the failures necessarily weren't yours if it's something

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.880
 that was completely out of your control and you obviously need

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.890
 to bring that up to your chain of command and show the steps that you

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.890
 took to try and achieve this impossible mission to make it a reality

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.900
 and those factors that you were out of your control that cause you

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.900
 to fail but also to you want to limit the amount of plane that you're

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.900
 putting on outside organizations are outside factors because at

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.910
 the end you're still probably the one that's ultimate responsible need

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.910
 to own that so you're gonna have to walk around that very delicately

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.920
 and and figure out you know how you can convey that message to

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.920
 your superiors without placing blame on somebody else
