00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.730
what kind of lifestyle you can afford as a junior officer is really going

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.610
 to be dependent on what your current financial situation is to begin

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.490
 with some people come into the service start out with nothing in

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.370
 their bank accounts where other people already have a nice nest egg

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.250
 built up so it's gonna be depending on where you're at starting out

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.130
 financially however you need to you know be good stewards with your

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.010
 money and make sure that you're not spending it on frivolous things

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.890
 because I can catch up with you in the long run you need to live within

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.770
 your means and make sure that your also putting some money away

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.650
 monthly to it for that for that kind of buffer that savings buffer

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.530
 and you can do that by already having certain money allocated from

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.410
 your paycheck before you even receive it go directly to a say a savings

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.290
 account or some other type of savings vehicle before you even actually

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.170
 touch that money and so that's what I'd recommend is is taking

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.050
 a percentage of your money from every paycheck making sure that you're

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.930
 paying yourself first by having to go to some sort of savings account

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.810
 and live within your means
