00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.730
what kind of lifestyle you can afford is a junior officer is really gonna

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.610
 be dependent on what your current financial situation is. To begin

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.490
 with. Some people come into the service, start out with nothing in

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.370
 their bank accounts where other people already have. Ah, nice nest

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.250
 egg built up. So that's gonna be dependent on where you're at. Starting

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.130
 out financially, however, you need to, you know, be good stewards

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.010
 with your money and make sure that you're not spending it on frivolous

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.890
 things because I can catch up with you in the long run. You need

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.770
 to live within your means and make sure that you're also putting

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.650
 some money away monthly Uh, toe for that kind of buffer, that savings

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.530
 buffer. And you could do that. Bye already having certain money allocated

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.410
 from your paycheck before you even receive it? Go directly to,

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.290
 say, a savings account or some other type of savings vehicle before

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.170
 you even actually touch that money. And so that's what I'd recommend

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.050
 is is taking a percentage of your money from every paycheck and

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.930
 making sure that you're paying yourself first by having to go to some

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.810
 sort of savings account and live within your means.
