00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.310
part of my future that I'm most worried about is the time that I start

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.760
 getting ready to retire which you know I'm not sure when that's going

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.220
 to be but I am poaching that window soon essentially could retire

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.670
 after this tour of duty it'll put me at twenty one years and I really

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.130
 don't know what I'm gonna do next I do have several opportunities

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.580
 and things that I can do in the outside world if I do decide to retire

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.040
 but you know this is been my way of life for the last eighteen years

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.490
 soon to be the last twenty one years and so you know now moving

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.950
 to somewhere different where I don't have the same security that I'm

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.400
 used to the same medical dental benefits the same pay the same access

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.860
 to educational benefits I'm kind of out there finding on my own

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.310
 that's that's a little bit scary for me so your retirement actually

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.770
 I think is is what kind of worries me as I approach that time
