00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.990
part of my future that I'm most worried about is ah, the time that I start

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.120
 getting ready to retire, which, you know, I'm not sure when that's

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.260
 gonna be, but I am approaching that window soon. Essentially could

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.400
 retire after this tour of duty. It'll put me at 21 years. Um, and

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.540
 I really don't know what I'm gonna do next. I do have several opportunities

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.670
 and things that I can do in the outside world if I do decide

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.810
 to retire. But, you know, this has been my way of life for the last

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.950
 18 years, soon to be the last 21 years. And so, you know, now moving

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.080
 to somewhere different where I don't have the same security that

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.220
 I'm used to the same medical dental benefits, the same pay. Ah, the

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.360
 same access to educational benefits. I'm kind of out there fending on

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.500
 my own. That's that's a little bit scary for me, So ah, retirement,

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.630
 Actually, I think is what kind of worries me as I approach that time
