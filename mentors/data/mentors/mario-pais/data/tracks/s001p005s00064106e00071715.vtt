00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.860
so I do with all kinds of problems that very and and level of complexity

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.870
 some can be just my computer just doesn't seem to want to work for

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.880
 the day or my email is not seeming to work which can create frustration

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.890
 all the way up to logistical problems and requirements that we

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.900
 need to get X. amount of people ready to deploy within a moment's notice

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.910
 and I need to have X. amount of gear and equipment and flight

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.920
 scheduled going from one place to the other and needing to coordinate

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.930
 that so you know the problems can vary from something very small up

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.940
 to something very big which could impact operations in theater
