00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.460
So I deal with all kinds of problems that Varian in level of complexity,

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.070
 some congee, just my computer just doesn't seem to want to work for

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.680
 the day. Or my email is not seeming toe work, which can create frustration

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.290
 all the way up to logistical problems in requirements that

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.890
 we need to get X amount of people ready to deploy within a moments

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.500
 notice. And I need to have X amount of gear and equipment and flights

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.110
 scheduled going from one place to the other and needing to coordinate

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.720
 that. So you know the problems convey Ari from something very small

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.330
 up to something very big, which could impact operations in theater.
