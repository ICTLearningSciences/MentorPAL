00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.020
for me the failures that I'm most unhappy about or those that I have not

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.190
 had an opportunity to go back and fix it finish it was maybe I started

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.360
 a particular project and it just didn't get off the ground or

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.530
 start a particular program and we got to a point to where it was a complete

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.700
 failure and we've decided to move on and do something new but

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.880
 there's still that lingering thought of you know if only I could've

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.050
 applied this much more effort or maybe if I'd done this differently

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.220
 we could have at least completed it so you know my personality I don't

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.390
 like to leave things unfinished and so those failures that have

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.560
 not been fully vetted outer finished completely still kind of bother

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.730
 me from time to time
