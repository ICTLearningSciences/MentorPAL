00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.020
for me, the failures that I'm most unhappy about are those that I have

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.190
 not had an opportunity to go back and fix or finish, you know, So maybe

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.360
 I started a particular project and it just didn't get off the ground

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.530
 or I started particular program, and we got to a point where it

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.700
 was a complete failure, and we've decided to move on and do something

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.880
 new. But there's still that lingering thought of. You know, if only

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.050
 I could have applied this much more effort or maybe if I had done

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.220
 this differently, we could have at least completed it. So, um, you

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.390
 know my personality. I don't like to leave things unfinished. And so

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.560
 those failures that have not been fully vetted out or finished completely

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.730
 still kind of bothered me from time to time.
