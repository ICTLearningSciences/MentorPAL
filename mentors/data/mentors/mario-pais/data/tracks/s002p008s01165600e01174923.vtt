00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.400
options that you have to work with. A sailor who is sick and sometimes

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.950
 maybe for long periods of time, is working with your medical department

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.500
 to make sure that they're getting taken care of and the right approach.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.040
 Um, you you obviously want to make sure that the individual

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.590
 isn't just trying to get out of work by claiming they're sick all the

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.140
 time. That's something you can have with those discussions with your

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.690
 medical department and follow up with them. Uh, find out what information

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.240
 they can tell you based on HIPPA laws and those kind of things,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.790
 and they might be able to say, Yes, this person is going through

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.340
 this. Are there having this particular treatment plan, which consists

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.890
 of this and that way you're aware, and you can make those changes

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.430
 and adjustments to accommodate that individual? Ah, but you just

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.980
 need to kind of work with that individual as well as the medical department

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.530
 to figure out. You know, how we can get this person healthy

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.080
 again and operating at their full potential
