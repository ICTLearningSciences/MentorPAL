00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.430
So I end up doing a lot of travel in this community, even whether you're

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.020
 considered shore duty or sea duty. You're constantly traveling. Perfect

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.600
 example. I just got back from Guam this week. Um, the week of

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.180
 the month before that, I was in Florida. The month before that I was

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.770
 in Washington, So I'm constantly traveling, whether it's Conus, Rokko

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.350
 nous and I'm I'm in shore duty right now. I'm an instructor. So

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.930
 even on our sea duty, when you're actually operating, you're traveling

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.520
 as well. You're making 6 to 7 month deployments. You're traveling

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.100
 for exercises Conus and Oh, Conus as well. So we travel a lot for me.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.680
 That's that's kind of a positive. I enjoy traveling and seeing the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.270
 world. That's one of the reasons why I joined the Navy in the first

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.850
 place.
