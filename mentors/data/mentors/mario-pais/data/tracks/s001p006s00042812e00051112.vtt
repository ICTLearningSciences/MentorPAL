00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.760
so I end up doing a lot of travel is in this community even whether you're

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.670
 you're considered shore duty or sea duty your costly traveling

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.580
 perfect example I just got back from Guam this week the week of the

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.490
 month before that I was in Florida the month before that I was in Washington

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.400
 so I'm constantly traveling whether it's conus or conus and

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.300
 I'm in I'm in shore duty right now I'm an instructor so even on our

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.210
 sea duty when you're actually operating your traveling as well you're

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.120
 making six seven month deployments you're traveling for exercises

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.030
 conus and conus as well so we travel a lot and for me that's that's

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.940
 kind of a positive I enjoy travelling and seeing the world it's one

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.850
 of the reasons why I joined the navy in the first place
