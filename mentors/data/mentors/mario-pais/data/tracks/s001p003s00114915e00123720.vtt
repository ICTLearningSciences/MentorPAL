00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.850
some ways that my work colleagues and I socialize after work are either

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.860
 doing you know events where we can bring all of our families to like

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.860
 picnics things like that for example whenever we would go before

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.870
 we go out on the plane that we usually have some sort of family day

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.870
 for everybody within the platoon we'll do it on a weekend we'll do it

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.880
 somewhere whether it's at the beach or at a park or at some other

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.880
 kind of venue where all the families can get together it was significant

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.880
 others kids all that kind of mingling meet discuss and and kind

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.890
 of build that camaraderie not only as the platoon in the group but

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.890
 also too is the supporting family members that might have to come to

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.900
 support one another while we're away as well as support us while we're

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.900
 gone you know on deployment
