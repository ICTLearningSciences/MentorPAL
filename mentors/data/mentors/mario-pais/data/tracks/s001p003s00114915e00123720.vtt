00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.850
some ways. Ah, my work colleagues and I socialize after work are either

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.860
 doing events where we can bring all of our families to like picnics,

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.860
 things like that. For example, whenever we would go Ah, before we

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.870
 go out on employment, we usually have some sort of family day for everybody

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.870
 within the platoon. We'll do it on a weekend. Well, do it somewhere.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.880
 Whether it's at the beach or park are at some other kind of

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.880
 venue where all the families can get together. Significant others

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.880
 kids, all that kind of mingle and meet, discuss and kind of build that

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.890
 camaraderie not only as the platoon in the group but also to is the

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.890
 supporting family members that might have to kind of support one

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.900
 another while we're away as well as support us while we're gone, you

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.900
 know, on deployment
