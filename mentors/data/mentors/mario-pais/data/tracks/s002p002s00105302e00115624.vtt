00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.370
the navy's marine mammal program has been in existence since the early

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.880
 seventies where they were using dolphins and sea lions to conduct different

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.400
 operations for example the dolphins back in Vietnam were actually

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.910
 brought there and we're doing anti swimmer anti diver defense

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.430
 and cam Ranh bay and then the sea lions came online when they discovered

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.940
 that it was a lot more faster and effective to use the C. lines

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.460
 that can dive down to several hundred feet of depth to recover training

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.980
 minds as opposed to sending down a diver who could take you know

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.490
 hours to get down to a depth of that hook up and then come back to

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.010
 the surface so the navy's been using marine mammals since then to

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.520
 basically conduct you know mine countermeasures as well as anti swimmer

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.040
 and diver defense and they still continue to have them even though

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.550
 we are moving forward with advanced technology the marine mammal

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.070
 systems are still an option for the navy to use
