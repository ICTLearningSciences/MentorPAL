00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.810
some problems that you know I wouldn't try to resolve but would rather

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.770
 try and get help to the professional. Get that person help from a professional

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.740
 or use the resource is would be definitely anything that

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.700
 has to do with, like, marital problems. You know, I can give my advice

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.660
 and what I've done to keep my relationship going for the last 18

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.620
 19 years, being married with two kids. But after that, I'm gonna have

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.590
 that individual go and get the actual proper counseling they need,

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.550
 whether that's from the chaplain or fleeting family. Because, you

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.510
 know, I'm not a marriage counselor. I could just only give you, like

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.470
 my opinion on certain things to maybe help. But that's that's far as

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.430
 I can go. I'll get the right person to help that individual out. Also,

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.400
 anything that has to just do with, say, suicidal risk. You know,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.360
 I have been trained to recognize certain flags and tendencies and

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.320
 do what I can at my level. But after that I'm gonna get that individual

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.280
 to the right, either medical person or chaplain or support personnel

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.240
 that can really provide that individual with the help that they

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.210
 need because even though I'm trained to a certain level, I meant no,

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.170
 No needs are no way an expert in dealing with that. And so, God forbid,

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.130
 I'm responsible for somebody hurting themselves because I didn't

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.090
 get them the help that they needed. So those air kind of two examples

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.060
 I can think of that you're able to provide some level of help at

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.020
 your level, but you need to then get those individuals to the right

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.980
 people who are experts in that field.
