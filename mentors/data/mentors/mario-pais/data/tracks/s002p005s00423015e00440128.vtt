00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.810
some problems that you know I wouldn't try to resolve but would rather

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.770
 trying to get help to the profession you know get that person help

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.740
 from a professional or use the resources would be definitely anything

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.700
 that has to do with like marital problems you know I can give my advice

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.660
 and what I've done to keep my relationship going for the last

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.620
 eighteen nineteen years being married with two kids but after that I'm

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.590
 gonna have that individual go and get the actual proper counselling

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.550
 they need whether that's from the chaplain fleet and family because

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.510
 you know I'm not a marriage counselor I can just only give you like

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.470
 my opinion on certain things to maybe help but that's that's as far

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.430
 as I can go on get the right person to help that individual out of

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.400
 also anything that has to just do with say suicidal risk you know

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.360
 I have been trained to recognize certain flags and tendencies and and

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.320
 do it I can't my level but after that I'm gonna get that individual

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.280
 to the right either medical person or chap plan or support personnel

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.240
 that can really provide that individual with the help that they need

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.210
 because even though I'm trained to a certain level I'm at no no

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.170
 needs are at I'm no way an expert in dealing with that and so god for

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.130
 bid I'm responsible for somebody hurting themselves because I didn't

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.090
 get them the help that they needed so those are kind of two examples

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.060
 I can think of that you're able to provide some level of help at

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.020
 your level but you need to then get those individuals to the right

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.980
 people who are experts in that field
