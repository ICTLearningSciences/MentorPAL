00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.440
so, you know, in order lead honorably. You've gotta have that. That that

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.030
 word of integrity is as cliche as it sounds that we hear it coming

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:11.620
 into boot camp all throughout your career. You have to have that integrity.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.210
 But it's true. And that's why it's brought up. Because if

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.800
 you can have that self integrity to make sure that you're doing what

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.390
 needs to be done, regardless of the situation, regardless who's around,

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.980
 then internally, that's going to reflect on the people you're gonna

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.570
 lead. And they're gonna want a mere that and model your behavior

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.160
 as well as the folks that are your leadership are going to notice

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.740
 that you have that integrity and that it's kind of being reflected within

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.330
 the folks that you're leading, which in turn, they're gonna be

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.920
 able to trust you with more responsibilities and probably give you

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.510
 a lot more flexibility as well, because they understand that this isn't

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.100
 this individual has a lot of integrity, folks, that their leading

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.690
 have a lot of integrity. We can trust that person as well as that

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.280
 department or division that they're leading to get this job done without

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.870
 a lot of micromanagement or oversight. So again, as cliche as it

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.460
 sounds, you know, I think integrity is probably that most important

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.050
 aspect
