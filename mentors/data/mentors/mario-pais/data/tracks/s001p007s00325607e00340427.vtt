00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.640
so in order to lead honorably you've got to have that that that word of

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.430
 integrity is as cliche as it sounds we hear it coming to boot camp

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.220
 all throughout your career you have to have that integrity but it's

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.010
 true and that's why it's brought up because if you can have that self

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.790
 integrity to to make sure that you're doing what needs to be done

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.580
 regardless of the situation regardless who's around then internally

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.370
 that's going to reflect on the people you're gonna lead and they're

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.160
 gonna want Amir that and model your behavior as well as the folks that

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.950
 are your leadership are going to notice that you have that integrity

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.740
 and that it's kind of being reflected within the folks that you're

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.530
 leading which in turn they're gonna be able to trust you with more

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.320
 responsibilities and probably give you a lot more flexibility as

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.110
 well because I understand that this isn't this individual has a lot

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.890
 of integrity folks there leading have a lot of integrity we can trust

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.680
 that person as well as that department or division that they're leading

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.470
 to get this job done without a lot of micro management or oversight

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.260
 so again as cliche as it sounds you know it I think integrity

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.050
 is probably that most important aspect
