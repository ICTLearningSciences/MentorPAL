00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.680
having a conflict within your first few days of a new unit. That's that's

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.520
 entirely common. That's not uncommon at all. Your new S O. You got

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.350
 a new environment that you're trying to figure out and learn to and

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.180
 find out what those community norms are. And then, of course, you're

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.020
 new to the people that have been there already and are established,

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.850
 so they're trying to kind of figure you out as well. The biggest

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.680
 thing is communication. It kind of overcome those conflicts. You need

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.520
 to communicate to the people that you may be having a conflict with

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.350
 or communicate to your leadership that you are having a conflict

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.180
 and how you can overcome that. Um, that's but it's entirely common toe

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.020
 have some sort of conflict, whether it's external or internal. When

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.850
 you arrive to a new unit
