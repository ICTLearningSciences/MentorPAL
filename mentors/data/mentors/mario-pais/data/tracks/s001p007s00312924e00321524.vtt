00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.680
having a conflict within your first few days of of a new unit that's that's

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.520
 entirely common that's not uncommon at all of your new so you

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.350
 got a new environment that you're trying to figure out and learn to

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.180
 and find out what those community norms are and then of course you're

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.020
 new to the people that have been there already in our established

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.850
 and so they're trying to kind of figure you out as well the biggest

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.680
 thing is communication Akon overcome those conflicts you need to communicate

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.520
 to the people that you may be having a conflict with or communicate

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.350
 to your leadership that you are having a conflict and how you

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.180
 can overcome that that's it but it's entirely common to have some

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.020
 sort of conflict whether it's external or internal when you arrive

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.850
 to a new unit
