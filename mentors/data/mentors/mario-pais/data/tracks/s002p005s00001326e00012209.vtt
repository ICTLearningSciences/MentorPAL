00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.900
something that I do as a leader that I think is recommend for anybody

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.950
 in that you could imitate is to be a leader you also need to be a reader

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.000
 right so if you look at some of the greatest leaders that we've

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.050
 had you know in the military or just in in life in general if usually

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.090
 been well read individuals and so you know something that you can

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.140
 do is just start to read doesn't even have to necessarily be our books

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.190
 on leadership just read period start reading something that you

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.240
 like in a particular subject or category that you enjoy and then you

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.290
 can kind of start maybe moving into more other challenging subjects

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.340
 were start really trying to read up on leadership through books find

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.390
 people that you admire and see if they've written a book on leadership

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.440
 again most of our motor oil well respected military leaders probably

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.480
 have something that they've created a written even if it's not

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.530
 a book it's probably some sort of you know memorandum or doctrine that

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.580
 they've written and you can read that and try and then emulate that

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.630
 in in your day to day conversations and work ethic and and those

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.680
 kind of things
