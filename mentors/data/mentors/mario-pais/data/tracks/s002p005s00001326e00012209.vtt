00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.900
something that I do is a leader that I think recommend for anybody in

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.950
 that you could imitate is to be a leader. You also need to be a reader,

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.000
 right? So if you look at some of the greatest leaders that we've

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.050
 had, you know, in the military or just in in life in general they've

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.090
 usually been well read individuals. And so you know something that

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.140
 you can do is just start to read. It doesn't even have to necessarily

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.190
 be, Ah, books on leadership. Just read, period. Start reading something

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.240
 that you like in a particular subject or category that you enjoy.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.290
 And then you can kind of start maybe moving into MME. Or other

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.340
 challenging subjects. Or start really trying to read up on leadership

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.390
 through books, find people that you admire and see if they've written

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.440
 a book on leadership again. Most of our well respected military

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.480
 leaders probably have something that they've created or written. Even

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.530
 if it's not a book, it's probably some sort of, you know, memorandum

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.580
 or doctrine that they've written, and you can read that and try and

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.630
 then emulate that in your day to day Ah, conversations and work ethic

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.680
 and those kind of things
