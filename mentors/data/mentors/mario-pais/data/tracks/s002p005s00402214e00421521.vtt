00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.040
so some different risks that we take in this field in all kind of approach

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.230
 it twofold. One is, you know, what risk do we take duty wise and

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.410
 job wise, and then risk that you might have to take a ZA leader. So

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.600
 as far as the duty's concerned, you know, working with the E o d community,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.790
 um, and conducting mine countermeasures. We're working in

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.980
 austere environments around the world, operating from small boats in

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.160
 all varying types of sea state, sometimes with little to no oversight,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.350
 with maybe only the protection that we have with us in that small

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.540
 boat working around explosives or having to find certain minds. You

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.730
 know, working in a in a minefield or even near a minefield is just

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.920
 risky and inherent danger. Just that alone, um, you know, also being,

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.100
 ah, diver, You know, I'm dealing with the risks that you intend you

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.290
 you feel with diving, whether it's ah, cold water and the different

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.480
 gas laws and coming up too fast for ascending and those kind of different

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.670
 things. So a lot of different risk that we deal with as a job

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.850
 and duty side as a leader, you know, The risks that you're gonna

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.040
 deal with is far, as you know, people's careers, that you're working

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.230
 with their personal professional development. Are you steering that

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.420
 individual in the right way? Are you providing them the right advice?

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.610
 You know, there's a risk in that because they were gonna be taking

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.790
 what you say is potential gospel and truth, and you could possibly

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.980
 be staring them down the wrong path that has the make a wrong decision

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.170
 and it falls back on you. And so there is that risk that you're

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.360
 dealing with is you could possibly be jeopardizing other people's careers

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.540
 or livelihood, for that matter. So those are the things you gotta

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.730
 considering the risks that I deal with in my job, as well as that

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.920
 of being a leader.
