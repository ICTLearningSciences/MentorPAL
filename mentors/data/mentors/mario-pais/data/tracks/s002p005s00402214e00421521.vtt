00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.200
so some different risks that we take in this field not kind of approach

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.550
 it two fold one is you would restore we take duty wise and job wise

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.900
 and wrist that you might have to take as a leader so as far as the

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.250
 duties concern you know working with the E. U. D. community and conducting

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.590
 mine countermeasures and we're working in austere environments

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.940
 around the world operating from small boats in all varying types

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.290
 of C. state are sometimes with little to no oversight with maybe only

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.640
 the protection that we have with us in that small boat working around

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.990
 explosives or having to find certain mines you know working in a

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.340
 in a mine field or even near mine field is just risky in an inherent

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.690
 danger just that alone you know also it being a diver you know I'm

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.040
 dealing with the risks that you intend you and you feel with diving

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.390
 whether it's cold water and the different gas laws and coming up too

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.730
 fast for sending in those kind of different things so a lot of different

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.080
 risk that we deal with as a job and do decide as a leader you

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.430
 know the risks that you're going to deal with is far as you know careers

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.780
 that you're working with their their personal professional development

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.130
 are you steering that individual in the right way or you providing

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.480
 them the right advice you know there there's a risk in that

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.830
 his name they're gonna be taking what you say as as attentional gospel

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.180
 and truth and you could possibly be staring them down the wrong path

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.520
 that has the make a wrong decision and it falls back on you and

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.870
 so there is that risk that you're dealing with is you could possibly

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.220
 be jeopardizing other people's careers or livelihood for that matter

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.570
 so those are the things you gotta considering the risks that I deal

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.920
 with in my job as well as out of being a leader
