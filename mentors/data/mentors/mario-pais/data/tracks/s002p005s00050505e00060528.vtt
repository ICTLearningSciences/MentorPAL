00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.390
one thing that you need to know about yourself to lead a team is what

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.940
 are your flaws in what your weaknesses are again it's very easy to know

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.480
 what your strengths are but if you don't know what your weaknesses

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.020
 are and how to work on those and you're not gonna be able to improve

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.570
 yourself which in turn your can be able to improve your team so

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.110
 that I've usually done is no all sit down with the group as a whole

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.650
 after we've really developed like a good relationship in a team culture

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.200
 and I'll just ask the entire group you know no holds barred tell

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.740
 me like it is where where my family knew or how can I improve as your

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.290
 leader and actually get their opinion to be surprised the kind of

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.830
 things that you thought that you were doing right that you might be

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.370
 doing wrong in their eyes and then things that you thought were a weakness

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.920
 personally that they actually consider strength that you're

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.460
 doing correctly so you've got a every now and again sit down have those

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.000
 candid conversations with your team and let them tell you that the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.550
 emperor has no clothes and then take that criticism and work on it

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.090
