one thing that you need to know about yourself to lead a team is what

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.940
 are your flaws and what your weaknesses are again. It's very easy to

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.480
 know what your strengths are. But if you don't know what your weaknesses

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.020
 aren't howto work on those and you're not gonna be able to improve

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.570
 yourself, which in turn you're not gonna be able to improve your

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.110
 team. Something that I have usually done is I'll sit down with the

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.650
 group as a whole after we've really developed, like a good relationship

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.200
 in a team culture. And I'll just ask the entire group, you know,

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.740
 No holds bar. Tell me like it is, where where am I failing you or

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.290
 how can I improve is your leader and actually get their opinion? You'd

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.830
 be surprised the kind of things that you thought that you were doing

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.370
 right, that you might be doing wrong in their eyes and then things

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.920
 that you thought were a weakness personally, that they actually consider

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.460
 a strength of that you're doing correctly. So you've got every

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.000
 now and again sit down, have those candid conversations with your

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.550
 team and let them tell you that the emperor has no clothes and then

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.090
 take that criticism and work on it
