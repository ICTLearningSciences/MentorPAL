00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.810
something that you can do when your proposed different duty stations to

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.760
 pick from obviously talked to your family about where they'd like

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.720
 to go where they like to move to, it's gonna be different based on your

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.670
 current situation. You know, if you're just a single individual,

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.630
 then you're pretty flexible on where you can go on the station. If

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.590
 it's just you and spouse again, you're probably pretty flexible. If

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.540
 you have to move and be stationed elsewhere, then where you're currently

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.500
 located. Unless your spouse has a particular job to where it could

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.450
 be detrimental to her career, and moving and leaving from that area

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.410
 is he's gonna put her in a career situation. Then, of course, once

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.360
 you have Children now, you got to start thinking about moving them

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.320
 around from school to school and where they're at in their scholastic

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.280
 endeavors, is that gonna affect them? So how best can you work to

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.230
 keep kind of a stable lifestyle while also making progressing, hitting

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.190
 those career milestones? The biggest thing to do is just kind of

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.140
 talk to your family about the different places that you could be stationed

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.100
 at what looks good for you guys as a whole
