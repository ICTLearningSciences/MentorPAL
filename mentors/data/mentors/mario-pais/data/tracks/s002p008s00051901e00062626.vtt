00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.810
so that you can do when you're pose different duty stations to pick from

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.760
 so obviously talk to your family about where they'd like to go where

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.720
 they'd like to move to it's gonna be different based on your current

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.670
 situation you know if you're just a single individual then you're

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.630
 pretty flexible on where you can go on the station it is just you

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.590
 and a spouse yeah you're probably pretty flexible if you have to move

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.540
 in the station elsewhere than where you're currently located unless

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.500
 your spouse has a particular job to where it could be detrimental

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.450
 to her career and moving in leaving from that area is is gonna put

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.410
 her in a in a career situation and then of course once you have children

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.360
 now you got to start thinking about moving them around from school

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.320
 to school and where they're at in their scholastic endeavors is

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.280
 is that going to affect them so how best can you work to keep kind of

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.230
 a stable lifestyle while also making and progressing and hitting those

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.190
 career milestones the biggest thing to do is just kind of talk

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.140
 to your family about the different places you can be stationed at and

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.100
