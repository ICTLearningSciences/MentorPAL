00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.070
one particular leadership style that I hope is dying out would be that

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.300
 of the micro managing style. Um, it's been proven to not be very effective.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.520
 It creates trust issues if you're constantly having a micromanager

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.740
 people. Um, so I'm hoping that that's going away and that people

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.960
 start looking Maur towards, you know, being able to delegate down

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.190
 to the lowest person because that creates trust. It also builds responsibility.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.410
 And it also creates, you know, ah, leader of leaders.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.630
 So even the lowest guy feels that they have value and that they're

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.860
 able to lead something, even if it's just, you know, their own job that

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.080
 they're doing or another particular person is that the same rank

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.300
 is them. It's starting to build their responsibility, their leadership

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.520
 skills and that, you know, that feeds up a CZ well as it trickles

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.750
 down. So, um, I'm hoping that the style of like, micromanaging and

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.970
 that abusive style of leadership is going away
