00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.070
one particular leadership style that I hope is dying out would be out

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.300
 of the the micro managing style you it's it's been proven to not be

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.520
 very effective it creates trust issues if you're constantly having to

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.740
 micromanage your people so I'm hoping that that's going away and that

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.960
 people start looking more towards you know being able to delegate

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.190
 down to the lowest person because that creates trust it also builds

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.410
 responsibility and also creates you know of a leader of leaders so

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.630
 even the lowest guy feels that they have value and that they're able

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.860
 to lead something even if it's just you know their own job that they're

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.080
 doing or another particular person is at the same rank as them

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.300
 it's starting to build their responsibility their leadership skills

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.520
 and that you know that feeds up as well as it trickles down so I'm

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.750
 hoping that the style of like micro managing and that abusive style

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.970
 of leadership is going away
