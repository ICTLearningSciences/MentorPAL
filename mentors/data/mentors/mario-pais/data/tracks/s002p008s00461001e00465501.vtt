00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.940
some of the hobbies that I have time for our scuba diving, spear fishing,

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.030
 doing other things out on the water. And another one is hiking,

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.120
 uh, currently being stationed here in San Diego. Over the past several

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.210
 years, I've been slowly whittling away on the Pacific Crest Trail.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.300
 So the Pacific Crest Trail is about 2600 miles that go from the border

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.400
 of Mexico all the way to the border of Canada. And, um, when I'm

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.490
 able to take time, I take some time off work, and I usually do about

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.580
 a week at a time on the trail and usually bang out anywhere from

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.670
 80 to 100 miles. So currently I've got about 400 miles that I've done

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.760
 on the Pacific Crest Trail, and that's one of the hobbies that ideo

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.850
 I liketo like to hike and due out outdoor activities
