00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.940
some of the hobbies that I have time for our scuba diving spear phishing

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.030
 doing other things out on the water and another one is is hiking

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.120
 currently being station here in San Diego over the past several years

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.210
 I've been slowly whittling away on the Pacific crest trail so the

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.300
 Pacific crest trail is about twenty six hundred miles they go from the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.400
 border of Mexico all the way to the border of Canada and when I'm

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.490
 able to take time I take some time off work I usually do about a week

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.580
 at a time on the trail and usually bang out anywhere from eighty

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.670
 to a hundred miles so currently I've got about four hundred miles that

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.760
 I've done on the Pacific crest trail and that's where the hobbies

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.850
 that I do I like to like to hike in due out outdoor activities
