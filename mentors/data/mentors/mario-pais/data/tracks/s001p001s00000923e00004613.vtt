Hi, I'm Mario. I'm a senior chief petty officer in the Navy. Or I'm stationed

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.050
 in San Diego at Explosive Ordnance Disposal Training Unit One

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.150
 I've currently serving as the Navy Expeditionary Combat Commands lead

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.250
 unmanned underwater vehicle instructor and curriculum developer

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.350
 for the entire force. Having worked in that role, I've deployed multiple

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.450
 times to the fifth Fleet a O. R. Working in Bahrain and all throughout

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.550
 that region, up and down the Gulf and the Gulf of Aden. And

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.650
 in those areas, I'm married with two kids, both of which are in high

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.750
 school.
