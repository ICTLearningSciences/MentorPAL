00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.680
so a couple of good strategies toe have the right presence for your team.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.510
 A few examples, right? I think for me, which worked best is being

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.330
 approachable, being able to relate, setting an example and not sweating

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.160
 the small stuff because that can easily get in the way of the

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.990
 bigger goal or bigger mission. So if you were able to be approachable,

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.820
 kind of set that example as well as not sweating the small stuff,

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.650
 then, folks, we're gonna kind of look atyou and want to be able to

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.470
 come to you and ask you for help and know that what you're giving them

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.300
 is ah is honest feedback and that, you know what you're giving them

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.130
 is honesty.
