00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.680
so a couple of good strategies to have the right presents for your team

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.510
 the few examples right I think for me which works best is being approachable

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.330
 being able to relate setting an example and not sweating

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.160
 the small stuff you know because that can easily get in the way of the

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.990
 bigger goal a bigger mission so if you're able to be approachable

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.820
 kind of you know set that example as well as not sweating the small

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.650
 stuff then folks are going to kind of look at you and and want to be

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.470
 able to come to you and ask you for help and know that what you're

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.300
 giving them is is honest feedback and that you know what you're giving

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.130
 them is honesty
