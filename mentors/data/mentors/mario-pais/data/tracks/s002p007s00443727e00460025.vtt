00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.000
so you know depend upon where you're deployed in and what organization

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.150
 combatant commander that you're helping you know you might be during

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.300
 that full deployment costly working you know that's what the deployment

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.450
 is for is you're actually now applying all the training all the

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.600
 skills that you've achieved over the last several years or months

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.740
 or what have you and you're actually applying those on a in a realistic

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.890
 environment to conduct you know some sort of operation or or deployment

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.040
 schedule so you might find yourself just just working constantly

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.190
 and applying the skills that you retain however more than likely

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.340
 you are gonna have some down time throughout the deployment and it

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.490
 really just depends on where your station we're deployment is if you're

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.640
 on a ship in your deployed and you have some down time there's

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.790
 probably several activities they're going to be on board to kind of

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.940
 alleviate and break up that schedule of of just constant workload if

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.090
 maybe you're stationed overseas somewhere in your own a deployment

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.230
 and you're on a base I know definitely all those bases have some sort

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.380
 of you know M. W. R. facilities that provide things on base out of

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.530
 town that you can do and take advantage of those so really just depends

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.680
 what your deployment is where deployed how you deployed and you

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.830
 know what you're gonna be able to do for for relax
