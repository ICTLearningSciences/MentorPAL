00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.800
So you know, depending upon where you're deployed and and what Ah, organization

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.750
 or combatant commander that you're helping, You know, you

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.700
 might be during that full deployment, constantly working. You know,

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.660
 that's what the deployment is. Fours. You're actually now applying all

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.610
 the training, all the skills that you've achieved over the last several

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.560
 years or months or what have you and your actually applying those

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.510
 on a realistic environment to conduct some sort of operation or

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.460
 deployment schedule So you might find yourself just just working constantly

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.410
 and applying the skills that you've attained. Um however, more

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.360
 than likely, you are gonna have some downtime throughout that deployment,

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.320
 and it really just depends on where your station, where your

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.270
 deployment is. If you're on a ship and you're deployed and you have

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.220
 some downtime, there's probably several activities they're going

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.170
 to be on board to kind of alleviate and break up that schedule of just

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.120
 constant workload. If maybe you're stationed overseas somewhere and

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.070
 you're on a deployment and you're on a base, I know definitely all

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.020
 those bases have some sort of UMW our facilities that provide things

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.980
 on base out in town that you can do on take advantage of those. So

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.930
 it really just depends what your deployment is, where you're deployed

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.880
 and how you deployed. And, um, you know what you're gonna be able

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.830
 to do for for relax.
