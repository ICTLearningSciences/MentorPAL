right now I'm getting my college degree through Columbia College of Missouri

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.290
 I've actually done several college classes with the variety of

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.010
 different colleges throughout my career you know the navy has an agreement

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.730
 with with certain colleges that they'll all accept each other's

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.450
 credits so that way you're not necessarily pigeonholed to just

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.170
 going with one university or college and then you move in you know your

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.890
 stuff doesn't count anymore so you know here in San Diego Columbia

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.610
 College Missouri has a satellite school here and they've taken all

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.330
 my other credits from the other schools and universities that I've

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.050
 attended and I'm currently pursuing my bachelors in business administration

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.770
