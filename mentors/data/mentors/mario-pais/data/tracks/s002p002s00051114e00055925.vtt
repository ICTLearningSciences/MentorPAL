00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.860
so one way that you can you know improve morale if if given challenging

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.870
 task that's unexpected is it actually starts way ahead of that and

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.880
 that's you've got to kind of create and foster a culture with in your

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.890
 team that is used to having to deal with the unexpected and they

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.900
 understand why they're having to do it in the long run so you know when

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.910
 they do get throw these thrown these curve balls they're they're

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.910
 used to that and I understand that in the bigger scope there's a reason

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.920
 why they're having to stay late to work on something last minute

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.930
 because they have to accomplish an overarching objective mission or

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.940
 purpose but the only way that you can get them to start thinking that

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.950
 way is by having already foster that kind of culture earlier on

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.960
 you know prior to coming up with these these difficult situations
