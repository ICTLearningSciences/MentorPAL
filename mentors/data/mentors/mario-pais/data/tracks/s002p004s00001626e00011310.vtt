00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.910
What makes my leadership style unique is try and do my best to relate

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.970
 to the individual that I'm working with the people that I'm leading.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.030
 Um, one thing that I've learned is that you know, I'll never ask somebody

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.090
 to do something that I haven't myself already done or be willing

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.150
 to do. Um, I try and value everybody's opinion from the most junior

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.210
 person in the platoon. You know, up to my peers and leaders as well.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.270
 Um, I find that also setting realistic goals is important. That's

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.330
 gotten me through a lot of, ah, troubling times. And if we're working

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.390
 towards a larger goal, you've got to kind of have those steps to

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.450
 get to that large gold. So setting those realistic ones kind of helps

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.510
 build that team morale. Build that unit cohesion. Eventually, entire

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.570
 team is capable of achieving a lot more than they originally thought

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.630
 they could, because you've been fostering this kind of culture

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.690
 the entire time
