00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.220
what makes my leadership style unique is I'd trying do my best to relate

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.590
 to the individual that I'm working with the people that I'm leading

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.970
 one thing that I've learned is that you know all never ask somebody

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.340
 to do something that I haven't myself already done or be willing

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.710
 to do I try and value everybody's opinion from the most junior person

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.080
 in the platoon you know up to my my peers and leaders as well I find

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.460
 that also setting realistic goals is important element that's got

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.830
 me through a lot of troubling times and if we're working towards a

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.200
 larger goal you've got to kind of have those steps to get to that large

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.570
 goal setting those realistic ones kind of helps build that team

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.950
 morale build that unit cohesion eventually entire team is is capable

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.320
 of achieving a lot more than they originally thought they could because

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.690
 you've been fostering this kind of culture the entire time
