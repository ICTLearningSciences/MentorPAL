00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.740
military vacation or you know accruing leave it's routine so you get so

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.630
 many days per month every every month that you're in service you get

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.510
 X. amount of days and accrued your leave and depend upon your situation

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.400
 you can have sometimes up to ninety days of leave saved on the

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.290
 books if you've been on a deployment status for regular navy work

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.180
 usually only allowed to keep sixty days of leave on the books and you

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.060
 work with your chain of command in order to use that so you'll find

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.950
 that they'll be you know it several times throughout the year we are

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.840
 already going to get some time off whether it's a three day weekend

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.730
 because of federal holiday or it's say thanksgiving where you're

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.610
 given time off for that or what's also commonly referred to as holiday

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.500
 stand down during the the Christmas time and they had the new year's

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.390
 time frame usually given time off for that to where you probably

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.280
 don't even necessarily need to use leave the days that you're trying

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.170
 to use leave are usually normal working days that's where you're going

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.050
 to communicate that to your chain of command and ahead of time

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.940
 and ask for you know X. amount of leave it to go on vacation depend

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.830
 upon where you work they may regulate how much leave you can take at

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.720
 a certain time period I've worked some places where you know I could

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.600
 take thirty days off if I really wanted to they would allow me to

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.490
 do that no I never would do that because I know that I'd miss certain

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.380
 things I'd be hot be behind in the in the working position that I'm

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.270
 at but if I want to take thirty days I had no problem approving that

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.150
 have been other places where you know two weeks is like the maximum

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.040
 and that's probably all you're gonna be able to get in one sitting

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.930
 so you have to kind of plan for that and communicated to check
