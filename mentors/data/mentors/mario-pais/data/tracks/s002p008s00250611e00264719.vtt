00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.590
military vacation or, you know, accruing leave. Um, it's routine, so you

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.340
 get so many days per month every every month that you're in service.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.080
 You get X amount of days at a crew to your leave and depend upon

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.820
 your situation. You can have sometimes up to 90 days of leave saved

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.570
 on the books. If you've been on a deployment status for regular Navy

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.310
 work, usually only allowed to keep 60 days of leave on the books and

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.060
 you work with your chain of command in order to use that, so you'll

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.800
 find that they'll be, you know, several times throughout the year.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.540
 We're already gonna get some time off, whether it's a three day weekend

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.290
 because of federal holiday or its say Thanksgiving, where you're

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.030
 given time off for that, or what's also commonly referred to his

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.770
 holiday stand down during the Christmas time and the New Year's time

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.520
 frame. Usually given time off for that toe, where you probably don't

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.260
 even necessarily need to use. Leave the days that you're trying to

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.010
 use leave or usually normal working days, and that's where you're gonna

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.750
 communicate that to your chain of command and ahead of time and

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.490
 ask for, you know, X amount of leave to go on vacation. Depending upon

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:08.240
 where you work, they may regulate how much leave you can take at

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.980
 a certain time period. I've worked some places where, you know, I could

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.720
 take 30 days off if I really wanted to. They would allow me to

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.470
 do that. Now, I never would do that because I know that I'd miss certain

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.210
 things and I'd be be behind in the in the work and position that

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.960
 on that. But if I want to take 30 days, I had no problem approving

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.700
 that. I've been other places where, you know, two weeks was like the

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.440
 maximum, and that's probably all you're gonna be able to get in one

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.190
 sitting, so you have to kind of plan for that communicated to your

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.930
 chain
