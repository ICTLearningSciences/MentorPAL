00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.910
Ah, way that you can deal with an assignment that you don't like or that

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.980
 you don't feel is a good fit. Is, um first, try and maybe voice that

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.040
 Ah, to the people that are assigning you that, that you know, it's

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.100
 not something that you think you can do or that you want to be in.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.160
 Um, perhaps they can get it changed. But if you don't tell anyone

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.230
 about it, or at least tell the right people that nothing's gonna happen.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.290
 If you're still kind of stuck in that position, then you need to

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.350
 try and find out. Why am I here? There's gotta be a particular reason.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.420
 What is the bigger picture that I'm helping out with and find what

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.480
 your purpose is with doing there. More than likely, there is some

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.540
 sort of reason why they have you in that assignment or that job. Ah,

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.600
 and you just don't know what it is. So you need to find out what

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.670
 that purpose is, the bigger picture of it, and then, you know, be part

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.730
 of it and and go through and make the best of that situation
