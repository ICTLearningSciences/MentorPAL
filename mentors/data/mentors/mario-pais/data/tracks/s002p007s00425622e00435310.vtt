00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.910
way that you can deal with an assignment that you don't lie occur that

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.980
 you don't feel is a good fit is you first try maybe voice that to the

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.040
 people that are signing you that that you know it's not something

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.100
 that you think you can do or that you want to be in perhaps they can

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.160
 get a change but if you don't tell anyone about it or at least tell

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.230
 the right people and nothing's going to happen if you're still kind

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.290
 of stuck in that position then you need to try and find out why am

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.350
 I here there's gotta be a particular reason what is the bigger picture

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.420
 that I'm helping out with and find what your purpose is with doing

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.480
 there more than likely there is some sort of reason why they have

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.540
 you in that assignment that job and you just don't know what it is

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.600
 so you need to find out what that purpose is the bigger picture of it

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.670
 and then you know of it and and go through and make the best of that

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.730
 situation
