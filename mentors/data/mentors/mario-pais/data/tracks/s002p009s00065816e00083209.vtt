00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.120
a red flag in an evaluation that could be easily missed if you don't train

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.390
 your eye to it is just recognizing if the evaluation is generic

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.660
 in nature no is it sure it might talk about some great things but it

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.930
 does it answer the question so what you know for example you know

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.200
 semen so and so did this period okay so what you know how is that quantified

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.470
 how is that bringing to achieving an objective remission you

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.740
 know so if you can't answer the question so what when you're reading

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.010
 a sentence in an evaluation that is probably poorly written as well

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.280
 as if the evaluation is just written in general terms and there's

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.550
 really no quantifiable data there that really highlights with the individual

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.820
 is done for that entire year in those eighteen lines that

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.080
 you get in the in the evil all right up also if things don't match for

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.350
 example with the current you valves are done there's trade averages

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.620
 and every single one of those treat averages can be a one through

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.890
 five and so for example if somebody has a five marked in leadership

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.160
 is a trade average but then you see no where in their evaluation right

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.430
 up in those eighteen lines where it talks about what they did is

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.700
 a leader to get that top five spot in the trade average that should

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.970
 be a red flag why is this person getting marked the highest they possibly

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.240
 can and that leadership attributes but yet know where their valuation

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.510
 does it talk about what they did is a leader that should be

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.780
 a red flag is something for you to recognize
