00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.120
a red flag in an evaluation that could be easily missed If you don't train

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.390
 your eye to it is just recognizing if the evaluation is generic

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.660
 in nature, you know, is it sure it might talk about some great things,

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.930
 but it does it answer the questions. So what? You know, for example,

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.200
 you know, semen. So and so did this period. Okay, so what, you

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.470
 know, how is that quantified? How is that bringing to achieving an objective

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.740
 or mission, you know, So if you can't answer the question,

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.010
 So what? When you're reading a sentence in an evaluation, that is probably

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.280
 poorly written as well as if the evaluation is just written in

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.550
 general terms. And there's really no quantifiable data there that

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.820
 really highlights what the individual is done for that entire year in

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.080
 those 18 lines that you get in the evil right up. Also, if things

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.350
 don't match, for example, the way the current evils air done, there's

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.620
 trade averages, and every single one of those trade averages can be

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.890
 a one through five. And so, for example, if somebody has a five marked

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.160
 in leadership is a trade average. But then you see nowhere in their

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.430
 evaluation right up in those 18 lines where it talks about what

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.700
 they did is a leader to get that top five spot in the trade average.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.970
 That should be a red flag. Why is this person getting marked the highest

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.240
 they possibly can in that leadership attributes. But yet nowhere

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.510
 in their evaluation does it talk about what they did is a leader

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.780
 that should be a red flag and something for you to recognize.
