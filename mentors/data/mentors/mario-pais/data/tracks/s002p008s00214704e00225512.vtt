00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.630
stay in touch with your family on deployment is extremely easy now because

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.410
 of the way that of all the new technological advances that we have

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.200
 that we didn't have before new in the past and I had made a deployment

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.980
 this was even just in two thousand and two really in a way I

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.760
 was able to stay in touch with my family was weekly telephone call that

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.540
 we did at a pay phone bank that was there on base so you actually

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.330
 had to have calling cards and then you dial up and based on the time

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.110
 zone difference you hope you get a hold of somebody and then you

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.890
 talk with them until you're calling card ran out you know you did twenty

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.670
 minutes or so and then of course writing letters I was another

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.450
 way just keep in constant communications now I mean when you deploy

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.240
 you've got your cell phone you might be overseas but there's application

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.020
 that you can download where you can actually make video calls our

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.800
 phone calls you know using wifi and the internet you can still send

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.580
 letters home if you want you can use email you've got you know Skype

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.370
 and Facebook and video chat so it's actually incredibly easy nowadays

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.150
 to stay in touch with your family on a near daily basis than it

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.930
