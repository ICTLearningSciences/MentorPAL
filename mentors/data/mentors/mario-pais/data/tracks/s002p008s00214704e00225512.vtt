00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.630
staying in touch with your family on deployment is extremely easy now

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.410
 because of the way that of all the new technological advances that we

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.200
 have that we didn't have before, you know, in the past, and I have

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.980
 made a deployment, this was even just in 2002. Really? The way I was

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.760
 able to stay in touch with my family was ah, weekly telephone call

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.540
 that we did at a payphone bank that was there on base. So you actually

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.330
 had to have calling cards, and then you dial up based on the time

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.110
 zone difference, you'd hope you get ahold of somebody. Ah, and then

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.890
 you talk with him until you're calling card ran out. Or, you know,

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.670
 you did 20 minutes or so. And then, of course, writing letters. I was

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.450
 another way to keep in constant communications. Now, I mean, when

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.240
 you deploy, you've got your cell phone, you might be overseas. But

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.020
 there's applications that you can download where you can actually make

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.800
 video calls or phone calls. You know, using WiFi and the Internet,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.580
 you can still send letters home. If you want. You can use email you've

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.370
 got, you know, Skype and Facebook and video chat. So it's actually

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.150
 incredibly easy nowadays to stay in touch with your family on a

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.930
 near daily basis than it was in the past.
