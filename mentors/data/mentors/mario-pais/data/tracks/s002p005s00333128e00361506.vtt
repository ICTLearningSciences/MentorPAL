00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.840
one particular time where I had a disagreement with the people that I

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.840
 was leading and how to handle that situation was when it came to working

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.830
 hours so I had just moved into a new command I'd taken leadership

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.830
 of this new division they were all instructors and prior to their

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.820
 previous leader their you know their major focus was time off like

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.820
 they were under the impression that this you shore duty is supposed

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.810
 to work as less as possible and they really didn't care about how other

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.810
 people's careers were progressing so I came into that situation

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.800
 and realize that more than half of those individuals in there were still

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.790
 lacking on certain qualifications or certain milestones that they

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.790
 should have already hit having been at that command for as long as

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.780
 they had and so I kind of put out that listen we know things are gonna

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.780
 change a little bit this time of you getting out of here by noon

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.770
 every day since you don't have a class in session you know is going

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.770
 away until you can show me that you've achieved this particular qualifications

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.760
 that your least working towards it and making an admirable

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.750
 effort no working hours are gonna be what's set by the commanding

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.750
 officer as eight to four and we got into a pre heated discussion in

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.740
 an argument about that there's people that were very adamant that

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.740
 thing shouldn't change we should be able to do what we want to do and

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.730
 leave when we need to and I tried to explain to them that listen in

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.730
 the long run you know you're probably gonna thank me for this even

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.720
 after you leave the commander not gonna quite understand what I'm getting

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.720
 at but understand that there is a method to my madness and the

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.710
 whole point of that was that it not only is going to increase your

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.700
 personal and professional development it's gonna enhance your career

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.700
 over also improving the commands mission readiness because the more

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.690
 people that we have qualified as say master training specialist and

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.690
 that's going to improve our commands mission readiness we're gonna

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.680
 have a lot more effective training that's going to reciprocate down

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.680
 to the people that we are training here on a daily and weekly basis

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.670
 and then ultimately you're gonna look back and be glad that you got

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.660
 this qualification because of the opportunities you're gonna have not

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.660
 only in the service but when you get out and so after that he discussion

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.650
 eventually got the buy in people started to work on those qualifications

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.650
 they got them done and then we were able to go back to

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.640
 having kind of a you know flexible working hours because everyone was

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.640
 where they needed to be with their milestones in qualifications but

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.630
 it was incredible challenging it tested my fortitude on being very

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.630
 direct and not budging on with the rest of the group wanted to do which

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.620
 was you know maintain the status quo
