WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.750
one particular time where I had a disagreement with the people that I

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.650
 was leading. Um, and how to handle that situation was when it came to

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.550
 a working hours. So I had just moved into a new command. I had taken

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.450
 leadership of this new division. They were all instructors. And,

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.350
 uh, prior to their previous leader, they're, you know, they're major.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.250
 Focus was time off, like they were under the impression that this

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.140
 assure duty is supposed to work as less as possible. And they really

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.040
 didn't care about how their people's careers were progressing. So I

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.940
 came into that situation and realize that more than half of those individuals

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.840
 in there we're still lacking on certain qualifications or

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.740
 certain milestones that they should have already hit, having been at

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.640
 that command for as long as they had. And so I kind of put out that.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.540
 Listen, things are gonna change a little bit this time of you getting

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.440
 out of here by noon every day since you don't have a class in session,

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.340
 you know is going away until you can show me that you've achieved

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.240
 this particular qualification that you're least working towards

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.140
 it and making an admirable effort. Working hours are gonna be what

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.040
 set by the commanding officer as 8 to 4. And we got into a pretty heated

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.940
 discussion and argument about that. There's people that were very

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.840
 adamant that things shouldn't change. We should be able to do what

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.730
 we want to do and leave when we need to. And I tried to explain to

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.630
 them that Listen, in the long run, you know, you're probably gonna

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.530
 thank me for this even after you leave the command. You're not gonna

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.430
 quite understand what I'm getting at, but understand that there is

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.330
 a method to my madness. And the whole point of that was that it not

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.230
 only is going to increase your personal and professional development

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.130
 is gonna enhance your career, but we're also improving the commands

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.030
 mission writing this because the more people that we have qualified

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.930
 as, say, master training specialists and that's going to improve our

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.830
 commands, mission readiness, we're gonna have a lot more effective

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.730
 training that's gonna reciprocate down to the people that we are training

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.630
 here on a daily and weekly basis. And then ultimately you're

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.530
 gonna look back and be glad that you got disqualification because of

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.430
 the opportunities you're gonna have, not only in the service, but

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.320
 when you get out. And so after that, he'd discussion, eventually got

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.220
 the buy in. People started to work on those qualifications. They got

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.120
 them done. And then we were able to go back to having kind of a flexible

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.020
 working hours because everyone was where they needed to be with

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.920
 their milestones and qualifications. But it was an incredible challenge,

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.820
 and it tested my fortitude on being very direct and not budging

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.720
 on with the rest of the group wanted to do which was, you know,

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.620
 maintain the status quo.
