00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.470
what you need to know most about your team members of what is what drives

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.080
 them. Everybody has something that's different. They have their

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.700
 own personal backgrounds. Everyone's got a different diversity. They've

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.320
 grown up differently. Some of them have different morals and personalities,

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.940
 so you got to kind of figure out what each individual is,

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.550
 what makes them tick, what drives them and then use that to your advantage,

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.170
 as well as to theirs to improve the team as a whole and move

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.790
 forward with the mission objectives.
