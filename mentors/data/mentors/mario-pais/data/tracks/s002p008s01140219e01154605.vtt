00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.560
in order for you to really tell the difference between somebody who could

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.270
 possibly be a suicide risk and somebody was just having a bad day

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.980
 is you have to actually know your people. No, prior to that occasion

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.690
 happening, So you really got to know is you know Seaman Smith, for

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.400
 example, is this just a bad day for them Or they really out of character?

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.110
 And you're noticing a habitual pattern that they're coming into

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.820
 work every day, Not really themselves. When normally that individual

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.520
 is a very bubbly person or energetic or enthusiastic, and over

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.230
 the last few days they just haven't been, and they're starting to kind

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.940
 of give you these indicators where they're talking about, you know,

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.650
 things don't matter to them anymore. They're giving away things that

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.360
 you normally wouldn't think they would give away, or they're having

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.070
 issues at home, and that's affecting their their life at work. So

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.780
 you have to really kind of understand your people to first figure

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.490
 out if, in fact, that's just an individual having a bad day or if they're

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.200
 starting to show some sort of, you know, suicidal tendencies there,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.910
 and if you're concerned as you should be is the leader. You should

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.620
 talk to him about it regardless, even if the pretty if it's just

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.330
 having a bad day, you should still talk to them to find out why they're

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.040
 having a bad day. And if you're also noticing some of these flags

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.750
 that to you seem, you know, going down the wrong path, then you

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.450
 need to definitely pull that person aside and talk to them. Let him

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.160
 know that you care and listen. That's the biggest thing is. Ask him

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.870
 a few questions and then just let them talk. Let them vent. Let them

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.580
 get that grief off and listen to what they have to say and then from

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.290
 there, make the decision. If you need to get, get more support for

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.000
 them or if it's just, you know, a bad day and it's something that's

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.710
 gonna be ah, rectified tomorrow
