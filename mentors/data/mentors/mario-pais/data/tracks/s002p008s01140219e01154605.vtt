00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.700
in order for you to really tell the difference between somebody who could

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.540
 possibly be a suicide risk and somebody's just having a bad day

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.390
 is you have to actually know your people your prior to that occasion

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.240
 happening so you really got to know is you know Stephen Smith for example

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.080
 is is just a bad day for them or they really out of character

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.930
 and you're noticing a habitual pattern that they're coming in to work

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.780
 every day not really themselves when normally that individuals very

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.620
 bubbly person or energetic current views yeah stick and over the

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.470
 last few days they just haven't been and they're starting to kind of

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.320
 give you these indicators where they're talking about you know things

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.160
 don't matter to them anymore they're giving away things that you

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.010
 normally would think they would give away or they're having issues at

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.860
 home and that's affecting their their life at work so you have to

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.700
 really kind of understand your people to first figure out if in fact

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.550
 that's just an individual having a bad day or if they're starting to

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.400
 show some sort of you know suicidal tendencies there and if you're

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.240
 concerned as you should be is the leader you should talk to about it

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.090
 regardless even if the proof is just having a bad day you should still

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.940
 talk to them to find out why they're having a bad day and if you're

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.780
 also noticing some of these flags at two you seem you know going

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.630
 down the wrong path then you need to definitely pull that person aside

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.480
 and talk to them let him know that you care and listen that's the

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.320
 biggest thing is asking a few questions and then just let them talk

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.170
 let them vent let them get that grief off and listen to what they

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.020
 have to say and then from there make the decision if you need to get

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.860
 get more support for them or if it's just you know a bad day and it's

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.710
 something that's going to be rectified tomorrow
