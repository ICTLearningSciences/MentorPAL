00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.170
My ideal team is a group of individuals that are able to think on their

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.500
 own that are creative, innovative, able to adapt, but then are able

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.820
 to also come together to accomplish ah, major goal. It's good to always

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.150
 have people that have their own individual ideas within a team,

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.470
 because you can always find out new, interesting ways to approach

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.800
 a problem and come to a new solution as opposed to everyone that has

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.120
 that groupthink mentality. So, you know, that's my ideal team is everyone

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.450
 that can think individually but be working towards that common

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.770
 group goal.
