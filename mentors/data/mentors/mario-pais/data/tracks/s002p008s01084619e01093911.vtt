if you're talking with an individual and they're starting to give you

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.910
 those indicators that they're having thoughts of suicide, the first

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.430
 thing is, you know, don't leave that individual alone. Try and talk

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.960
 with them. You can even ask them directly. Have you thought about hurting

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.490
 yourself or anyone else around? You start to see if if they're

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.020
 really gonna tell you most the time, you'll find that if somebody has

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.550
 really thought about it, they're probably gonna tell you that they

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.070
 have or they're gonna give you indications that they have started

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.600
 thinking about that and then obviously don't leave that person alone.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.130
 Take them somewhere to get help, whether that's two medical, whether

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.660
 that's to the chaplain or that's to some other sort of counseling

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.190
 function. But you know it's not your job to fix that person right then

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.710
 and there. You probably don't have the skills necessary to do that.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.240
 Your skills are still. Listen. Be a good listener, ask questions

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.770
 and then get them to the help that they need
