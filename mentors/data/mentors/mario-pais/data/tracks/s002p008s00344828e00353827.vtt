00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.690
service is that you're gonna find on a navy base differentiate based on

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.540
 where you're gonna be stationed. You'll find that the larger Navy

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.380
 bases pretty much have every kind of service you can think of right

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.230
 there on base. I mean, you'll have your medical, you'll have dental,

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.070
 you'll have shopping, you have places to eat. There's an M W. Are there

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.920
 that can do? Ah, extracurricular activities. I mean, there'll be

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.760
 financial service is on base counseling. Service is people to do your

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.610
 taxes, you know, whereas when you get to a smaller base, you might

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.450
 find yourself a little bit more limited and have to do things out

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.300
 of town in order to get those service is so it really just depends

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.140
 on where you're gonna be stationed. But, you know, the Navy's done a

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.990
 really good job of providing you with a lot of service. Is you need

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.830
 right there on base
