WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.900
something that I did that got a lot of press and actually made it back

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.940
 into my even my hometown newspaper was when I was a marine mammal when

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.990
 I was a marine mammal handler and were deployed the ball rain using

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.030
 the dolphins there, the U. S. So you know, they come in with celebrities

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.080
 all the time to do visits on base, and somehow they got win

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.130
 that there were Navy dolphins. They're in the area that we're trained

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.170
 to find enemies, swimmers and divers. And so they ended up setting

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.220
 up a meet and greet, um with some of the people that they brought

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.260
 through from the U. S. So so one of those individuals happen to be Ben

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.310
 Affleck who came down, and I basically showed him the dolphins that

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.360
 we worked with. I let him throw some fish to the Dolphins and actually

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.400
 do a couple of tricks. And, uh, there was a picture that was taken

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.450
 of Ben Affleck kind of kneeling down next to me is I'm handling

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.500
 this dolphin in front of them, and that got kind of distributed out

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.540
 to the Associated Press and was then, like, kind of published worldwide.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.590
 on many newspapers from California all the way to Florida To the

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.630
 where, you know, even my hometown newspaper in ST Pete had it there

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.680
 on one of the pages. San Diego had it. And there was other places

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.730
 that I was getting phone calls from friends and family around the country.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.770
 That was like, Hey, I saw you in our paper here, so Ah, that

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.820
 was kind of Ah, fun, unique experience. And I ended up saving, like,

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.860
 a clip of that paper, and I still have it somewhere in a file or folder.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.910
 But yeah, that was kind of a neat experience.
