00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.830
as a leader, you should start understanding. You know what those bigger

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.820
 goals are, As opposed to just working on something, you know, at the

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.800
 at the more subordinate levels. So sometimes you might have to go

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.790
 out of your way to find out what those overarching goals are. I need

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.770
 to ask those questions. You need to go to your leadership and ask

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.760
 them what their expectations are of you and what they want to see happen.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.690
 to you might have to go out of your way to find out what are my commands

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.680
 goals and how can I effectively make an impact in those goals or

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.660
 what are some deficiencies that my command has? And how can I kind

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.650
 of, you know, chip away at those deficiencies and turned them from

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.630
 something negative into positive and move in that direction?
