00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.830
as a leader you should start understanding you know what those bigger

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.820
 goals are suppose just working on something you know at the at the more

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.800
 subordinate levels so sometimes you might have to go out of your

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.790
 way to find out what those over arching goals are you need to ask those

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.770
 questions you need to go to your leadership and ask them what their

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.760
 expectations are of you and what they want to see happen not within

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.740
 just your individual division or platoon or department but for

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.720
 the command as a whole so you got to really understand what those goals

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.710
 are not always is someone going to force feed that to you might

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.690
 have to go out of your way to find out what are my commands goals and

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.680
 how can I effectively make an impact in those goals or what are some

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.660
 deficiencies at my command has and how can I kind of you know chip

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.650
 away at those deficiencies and turn them from something negative into

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.630
 a positive and and move in that direction
