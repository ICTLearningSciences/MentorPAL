00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.590
ways that you can help your team prepare for an upcoming tough mission

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.340
 first and foremost is obviously training and you have to have that

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.080
 foresight ahead of time to know that should be of particular mission

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.820
 coming down the line and then training to that and stressing them as

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.560
 much as you possibly can in that training environment to prepare them

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.310
 for that tough mission ahead so that way the first time that they're

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.050
 experiencing some of that toughness you know isn't during when

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.790
 that mission is happening but they will actually already experienced

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.530
 that during training set situations and scenarios because that's where

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.280
 you can apply fixes when you start noticing some of those deficiencies

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.020
 and building that mental tenacity and when that mental to nasty

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.760
 is built then you also start to see that physical capacity come out

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.500
 and they'll be ready for those tough mission so training ahead of

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.250
 time and and training and stressful environment that's going to get

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.990
 you prepared for those tough missions
