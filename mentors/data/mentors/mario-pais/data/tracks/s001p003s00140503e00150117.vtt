00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.590
ways that you can help your team prepare for an upcoming tough mission.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.340
 First and foremost is obviously training, and you have to have that

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.080
 foresight ahead of time to know that it's gonna be a particular mission

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.820
 coming down the line and then training to that and stressing them

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.560
 as much as you possibly can in that training environment to prepare

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.310
 them for that tough mission ahead. So that way, the first time that

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.050
 they're experiencing some of that toughness, you know, isn't during

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.790
 when that mission is happening. But they will actually already experienced

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.530
 that during training situations and scenarios, because that's

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.280
 where you can apply. Um, fixes when you start noticing some of

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.020
 those deficiencies and building that mental tenacity. And when that

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.760
 mental tenacity is built, then you also start to see that physical tenacity

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.500
 come out and they'll be ready for those tough missions. So training

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.250
 ahead of time and training and stressful environment that's

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.990
 gonna get you prepared for those tough missions
