00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.240
I think, you know, maybe one that is in our field as well as maybe just

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.640
 across the board as a whole is, um, you know, alcohol abuse and maybe

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.030
 the crimes that come with that, you know, depending upon the job

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.430
 that you're doing, a lot of times it can be stressful environment.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.820
 You're doing stressful things. And so for people to, um, kind of unwind

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.210
 from that and step out of that mindset. What time's the lean toe

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.610
 to the use of alcohol or other substances? Um, and you know, there's

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.000
 nothing wrong with having a drink here there. But if individuals start

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.400
 abusing that alcohol and then that starts leading to issues at

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.790
 work, missing work, problems with their home life, or even do you wise

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.180
 things like that, then that's something that you need to be really

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.580
 aware of. So you have to kind of understand your people understand

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.970
 what makes them tick, understand when they're having a good day and

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.370
 wins a bad day, even if they don't vocalize that and see if it has

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.760
 anything that has to do or related to, Ah, you know, alcoholism.
