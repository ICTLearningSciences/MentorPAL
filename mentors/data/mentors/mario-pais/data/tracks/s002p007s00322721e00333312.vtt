00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.240
I think you know maybe one that does it in a in our field as well as maybe

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.640
 just across the board as a whole is you alcohol abuse and maybe

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.030
 the crimes that come with that you know depending upon the job that

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.430
 you're doing a lot of times it can be stressful environment you're

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.820
 doing stressful things is for people to kind of on wine from that and

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.210
 and step out of that mindset well times a lean to to the use of alcohol

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.610
 or other substances and you know there's nothing wrong with having

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.000
 a drink here there but if individual start abusing that alcohol

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.400
 and then that starts leading to issues at work missing work problems

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.790
 with their home life or even do you wise things like that then that's

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.180
 something that you need to be really aware of so you have to kind

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.580
 of understand your people understand what makes them tick understand

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.970
 when they're having a good day and one's a bad day even if they don't

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.370
 vocalize that and see if it has anything that has to do or related

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.760
 to you know alcoholism
