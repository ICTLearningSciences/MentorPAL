00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.960
one way that I handled self doubt is trying to reflect on previous achievements

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.070
 that I've had before. Or maybe I doubted myself then. But

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.180
 then, having continued on and persevered, I was able to get through

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.280
 and be successful. So if I'm coming across another situation, I recognize

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.390
 that. Okay, I'm having self doubt again. What did I do the previous

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.500
 time to overcome this and try and use those same tactics to overcome

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.610
 the current self doubt that I'm having?
