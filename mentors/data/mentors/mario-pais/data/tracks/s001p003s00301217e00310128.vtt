00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.940
the relationship that you have with the people that are in charge of you.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.040
 In my opinion, he's to be kind of open and honest. Um, they need

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.130
 to know what your expectations are of them, and you definitely need

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.220
 to know what their expectations are of you. And if you're meeting those,

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.320
 so it's it's okay to occasionally get with them and ask, Hey,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.410
 you know, my meeting, your expectations of my meeting, the commands

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.500
 objective of mission objectives are weak heading the right direction

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.600
 and constantly reassess those things because those situations change

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.690
 and those objectives change all the time. But you want to have an

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.780
 open, honest relationship with your superiors, so that way they trust

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.880
 is built and they take what you say as a CZ truth. And they're not

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.970
 gonna doubt kind of the information that you're putting out
