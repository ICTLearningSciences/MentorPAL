00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.940
the relationship that you have with the people that are in charge of you

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.040
 in my opinion needs to be kind of open and honest they need to know

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.130
 what your expectations are of them and you definitely need to know

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.220
 what their expectations are of you and if your meeting those so it's

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.320
 it's okay to occasionally get with them and ask Hey you know my meeting

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.410
 your expectations of my meeting the commands objective a mission

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.500
 objectives are we heading in the right direction and constantly

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.600
 reassess those things because the situation is changing those objectives

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.690
 change all the time but you want to have an open honest relationship

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.780
 with your superiors so that way they they that trust is built

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.880
 and they take what you say as as truth and they're not gonna die out

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.970
 kind of the information that you're putting out
