00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.900
something that I did they got a lot of press and actually made it back

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.940
 into my even my hometown newspaper was when I was marine mammal when

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.990
 I was a marine mammal handler we were deployed to Bahrain using the

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.030
 dolphins there the U. S. so you know they come in with celebrities

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.080
 all the time do visits on bass and somehow they got wind that there

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.130
 were navy dolphins there in the area that we're trained to find enemy

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.170
 swimmers and divers and so they ended up setting up a meet and greet

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.220
 with some of the people that they brought through from the US so

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.260
 so one of those individuals happened to be Ben Affleck we came down

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.310
 and I basically showed him the dolphins that we worked with I let him

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.360
 you know throw some fish to the dolphins and actually do a couple

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.400
 of tricks and there's a picture that was taken of Ben Affleck kinda

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.450
 kneeling down next to me is I'm handling this dolphin in front of them

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.500
 and that got kind of distributed out to the Associated Press and

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.540
 was then like kind of published worldwide on many newspapers from California

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.590
 all the way to Florida to the where you know even my hometown

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.630
 newspaper in Saint Pete had it there on one of the pages San Diego

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.680
 had it there was other places that was getting phone calls from friends

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.730
 and family around the country that was like Hey I saw you in

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.770
 our paper here so that was kind of a fun unique experience and I ended

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.820
 up saving like a clip of that paper and I still have it somewhere

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.860
 in a in a file or folder but yeah that was kind of a neat experience

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.910
