00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.960
one of my favorite books, and I don't know if it's of all time. But one

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.060
 book that I have read more than others kind of over and over again

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.170
 is Steven Press Fields. Gates of Fire really enjoy that book. It's

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.270
 basically kind of a of a fictional take about the non fictional Battle

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.380
 of Thermopylae and, ah, you know, the Spartans going against Persia.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.490
 And there's a lot of good kind of, um, values on leadership and

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.590
 some nuggets in there that are kind of good takeaways is just an overall

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.700
 great story. So that's kind of one of my favorite books that I'll

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.800
 have a tendency to read if I don't have anything else to read, all

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.910
 kind of re read that book over again.
