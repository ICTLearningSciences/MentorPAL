00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.960
one of my favorite books and I don't know if it's of all time but one

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.060
 book that I have read more than others kind of over and over again is

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.170
 Stephen press fields gates of fire I really enjoy that book is basically

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.270
 kind of a of of fictional take about the non fictional battle

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.380
 of Thermopylae and the near the Spartans going against Persia and there's

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.490
 a lot of good kind of values on leadership in some nuggets in

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.590
 there that are kinda good takeaways just an overall great story so

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.700
 that's kind of one of my favorite books that all have a tendency if

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.800
 to read if I don't have anything else to read all kind of re read that

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.910
 book over again
