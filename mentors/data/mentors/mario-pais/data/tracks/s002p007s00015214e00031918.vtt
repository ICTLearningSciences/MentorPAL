00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.200
one challenge that I've faced kind of my entire career is the fact that

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.550
 I'm doing kind of unconventional work as a whole maintenance technician

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.910
 if you actually talk to somebody who is an H. T. you know and

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.260
 explain to them what it is I do they'd probably come and tell you that

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.610
 that's that's not what an H. T. does and so I've had a challenge

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.960
 with with progressing in making rank because I'm view it is not working

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.310
 in rate doing on conventional work is an H. T. even though I kind

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.670
 of disagree with that that thought process because I am filling the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.020
 role or the billet of NH T. it just so happens that it's not traditional

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.370
 H. T. work so somewhere somebody in the navy felt that an H.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.720
 T. needs to be doing this and so that's what I'm doing and the way that

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.070
 I've overcome that is just continually to perform in whatever duty

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.430
 I've been given so you know if there's certain qualifications that

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.780
 I need to have I'd I get those and I and I and I totally understand

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.130
 them and then I also help other people get them so you have to if

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.480
 you're faced with a situation like that you really have to perform and

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.830
 show that you deserve to be doing what you're doing and to get to

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.190
 where you're going and so it one of my biggest challenges is you know

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.540
 how do I make rank I and show that I you know have leadership value

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.890
 in that I have value as an H. T. when I'm not doing that work
