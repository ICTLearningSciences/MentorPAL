00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.200
one challenge that I've faced kind of my entire career is the fact that

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.550
 I'm doing kind of unconventional work as a whole maintenance technician.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.910
 If you actually talked to somebody who is an h ti umm you know

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.260
 and explain to them what it is I do, they'd probably come and tell

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.610
 you that that's that's not what an HT does. And so I've had a challenge

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.960
 with with progressing and making rank because ah viewed is not

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.310
 working in rate. Doing unconventional work is an H T, even though I

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.670
 kind of disagree with that that thought process, because I am filling

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.020
 the role or the billet oven ht. It just so happens that it's not traditional

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.370
 ht work. So somewhere somebody in the Navy felt that an HT

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.720
 needs to be doing this. And so that's what I'm doing. Um, and the

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.070
 way that I've overcome that is just continually to perform in whatever

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.430
 duty I've been given. So you know, if there's certain qualifications

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.780
 that I need to have, I get those and I totally understand them,

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.130
 and then I also help other people get them. So you have thio. If you're

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.480
 faced with a situation like that. You really have to perform and

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.830
 show that you deserve to be doing what you're doing and to get to where

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.190
 you're going. And so one of my biggest challenges is how do I make

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.540
 rank and show that I, you know, have leadership value and that I

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.890
 have value as an HT when I'm not doing that work.
