00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.780
so my workday has changed over my career's. I've progressed in leadership.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.700
 Obviously, when I was a junior person, my work day was really kind

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.630
 of delegated out to me by my Opio in my chief of the time. And so

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.560
 I knew kind of what I had to do for the day and what my set hours

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.480
 were as I've progressed in my leadership and throughout my career, you

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.410
 know, now, my work day, Um, it seems like it never ends, to be honest,

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.340
 because I have a lot more responsibilities that I need to look

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.270
 at and conduct. I've other people's careers that I'm also responsible

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.190
 for, as well as maintaining the program that we work in and moving

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.120
 that forward. So I would say that my work day and workload has increased

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.050
 as I progressed in my career. But that's expected, and that's

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.970
 something that you should you intend on seeing as you move up in leadership

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.900
 and throughout your career.
