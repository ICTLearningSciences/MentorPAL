00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.780
so my work days change over my career as I've progressed and leadership

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.700
 obviously when I was a junior person in my work day was really kind

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.630
 of delegated out to me by my PO and my chief at the time and so I

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.560
 knew kind of what I had to do for the day and what my set hours work

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.480
 as I progressed in my leadership and throughout my career you know

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.410
 now my work day seems like it never ends to be honest because I have

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.340
 a lot more responsibilities that I need to look at and and and conduct

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.270
 I bought other people's careers that I'm also responsible for as

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.190
 well as maintaining the program that we work in and moving that forward

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.120
 so I would say that my work day and workload has increased as I

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.050
 progressed in my career but that's expected and that's something that

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.970
 you should you intend on scene as you move up in leadership and throughout

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.900
 your career
