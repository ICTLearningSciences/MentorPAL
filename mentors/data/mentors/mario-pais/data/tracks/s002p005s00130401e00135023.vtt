00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.410
some warning signs that you might see with problems of your team morale

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.960
 is gonna be the first one if you're noticing that everybody is just

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.520
 down people don't enjoy being where they're at they don't joy the

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.070
 work that they're doing that should be one red flag right there and

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.630
 that's where you need to take time to step away gather the group up

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.180
 and find out what is going on that's that's decreasing morale another

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.740
 one that you're gonna find is just trust issues that are being with

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.290
 tested within the team people are trusting one another maybe they

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.850
 don't trust you maybe they don't trust their peers why is that happening

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.400
 because everyone should be able to trust one another within the

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.960
 team OB so those are two that I can think of right now that or where

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.510
 it red flags if you're having issues with that issues within the team

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.070
