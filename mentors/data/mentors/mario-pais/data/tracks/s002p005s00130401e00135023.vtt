00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.410
some warning signs that you might see with problems of your team. Morale

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.960
 is gonna be the 1st 1 If you're noticing that everybody is just down,

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.520
 people don't enjoy being where they're at. They don't enjoy the

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.070
 work that they're doing. That should be one red flag right there, and

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.630
 that's where you need to take time to step away, gather the group

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.180
 up and find out what is going on. That's that's decreasing morale.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.740
 Um, another one that you're gonna find is just trust issues that are

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.290
 being with, ah, tested within the team. People aren't trusting one

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.850
 another. Maybe they don't trust you. Maybe they don't trust their peers.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.400
 Why is that happening? Because everyone should be able to trust

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.960
 one another within the team. So those air to that I can think of right

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.510
 now that are where red flags. If you're having issues with the issues

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.070
 within the team
