00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.700
that's that's really kind of a situational type question on wind to share

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.550
 personal stories or motions with your team I think it is dependent

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.390
 on what's going on the situation at hand the environment that you're

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.240
 in lot of times it makes sense to share very personal stories because

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.090
 then people can relate to a little bit more they understand that

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.940
 you're very similar to them you might even have a very similar story

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.790
 that they have which creates that relationship and build that trust

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.630
 and communication and then other times depend upon the situation

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.480
 or where you're at you might not want to share personal stories or

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.330
 show very much emotion so it's really something that you just kinda

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.180
 have to to gauge where you're at in the environment that you're in and

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.020
 the people that you're working with when's the right time to be emotional

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.870
 when's the right time to be a little more formal on those kind

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.720
 of things
