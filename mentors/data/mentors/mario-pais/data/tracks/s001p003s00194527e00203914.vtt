00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.700
that's that's really kind of a situational type question on wind to share

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.550
 personal stories or emotions with your team. I think it is dependent

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.390
 on, uh, what's going on, the situation at hand in the environment

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.240
 that you're in. Ah, a lot of times it makes sense to share very personal

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.090
 stories because then people can relate to you a little bit more.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.940
 They understand that, um, you're very similar to them. You might

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.790
 even have a very similar story that they have, which creates that

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.630
 relationship and builds that trust and communication on then other times

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.480
 to pay upon the situation or where you're at you might not want

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.330
 to share personal stories or show very much emotion. So it's really

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.180
 something that you just kind of have to gauge where you're at in the

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.020
 environment that you're in and the people that you're working with,

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.870
 when's the right time to be emotional wins the right time to be a

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.720
 little more formal in those kind of things
