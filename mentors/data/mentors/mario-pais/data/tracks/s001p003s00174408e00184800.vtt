00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.610
depending upon the type of people that you're leading you're gonna have

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.370
 to obviously have different leadership styles some you might have

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.130
 to be a little more intrusive on and provide a lot more detail maybe

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.890
 a little more hand holding then you'd like to do until they come to

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.650
 catch on and understand what it is you want then there's gonna be other

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.410
 folks that you just have to tell him one type of thing and they're

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.170
 off and running and they're gonna get it all done and come back

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.930
 to you with a product and you know it's exactly what you're looking

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.690
 for so you have to kind of understand those different types of people

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.450
 and work towards that in your leadership style to address those those

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.210
 concerns main goal is to trying to always improve people where they're

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.970
 at and making sure that you're using the right leadership style

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.730
 for the right person don't be too micro management might have to

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.490
 start that off in the beginning with a certain person but then eventually

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.250
 allow that you'll let the leash out let them get that responsibility

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.010
 and and build up their self esteem and their ability to take

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.770
 charge and there and continue to work for you do great things
