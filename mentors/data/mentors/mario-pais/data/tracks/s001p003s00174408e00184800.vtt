00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.400
depending upon the type of people that you're leading, you're gonna have

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.950
 to obviously have different leadership styles. Some you might have

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.500
 to be a little more intrusive on and provide a lot more detail may

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.050
 be a little more handholding than you'd like to do until they kind

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.610
 of catch on and understand what it is you want. Ah, then there's gonna

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.160
 be other folks that you just have to tell him one type of thing and

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.710
 they're often running and they're going to get it all done and come

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.260
 back to you with a product. And, you know, it's exactly what you're

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.810
 looking for. So you have to kind of understand those different types

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.360
 of people and work towards that in your leadership style to address

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.910
 those those concerns. Main goal is to trying to always improve people

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.460
 ah, where they're at and making sure that you're using the right

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.010
 leadership style for the right person. Um, don't be too micromanagement.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.570
 I might have to start that off in the beginning with a certain

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.120
 person, but then eventually allow that you let the leash out, let

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.670
 them get that responsibility and build up their self esteem and their

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.220
 ability to take charge and continue to work for you do great things
