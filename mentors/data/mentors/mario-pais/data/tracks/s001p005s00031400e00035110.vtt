00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.600
 we're standing up and creating is very fluid and what kind of building

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.970
 it off the ground another way of saying is we're we're building

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.340
 this plane while we're flying at the same time so usually my work

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.710

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.090
