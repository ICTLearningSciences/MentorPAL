00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.560
so my typical week that my hours vary, and that's because the program

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.270
 that we're standing up and creating is very fluid, and we're kind of

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.980
 building it off the ground. Another way of saying is we're building

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.690
 this plane while we're flying at the same time. So usually my work

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.400
 weeks can consist of working from eight in the morning till sometimes

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.110
 10 at night. I do take my work home with me a lot of time. So if I'm

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.820
 here training personnel from early in the morning till 45 o'clock

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.530
 in the afternoon, there's stuff I still need to get accomplished. I'll

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.240
 take that home and work on it. So on average, you know, I'm working

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.950
 anywhere between 10 and 12 hours a day at a minimum.
