WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.500
are having. If your team is having trouble meeting standards on, you need

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.140
 to try and get them there. There's different things that you can

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.790
 do when the first things that I recommend is, you know, taking a pause,

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.430
 taking a step back and reassess what's going on. Is there something

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.080
 that you're missing as a leader that maybe isn't necessarily coming

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.720
 down to their level to help them make that mission achievement?

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.370
 Is there something going on personally in their life that you're not

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.010
 aware of? That has them, you know, not fully engage? Well, they're

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.660
 at work to make that mission accomplishment. You might find that after

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.310
 you talk with them that there is something going on personal and

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.950
 they're unable to focus. And so that was the issue. And so you can

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.600
 try and help them resolve that issue or get them to the people that

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.240
 can help them resolve that in that wayto hope, hopefully bring them

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.890
 back online and get them focused again. If you've kind of tried all

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.530
 that and you're basically at your wits and you really don't know what

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.180
 to do, obviously need to communicate that on up and say, Listen here

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.820
 the steps that I've taken to try and help my team make this mission

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.470
 successful or meet mission objectives. And we're just missing it.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.120
 Tried A, B, C, D and E and, well, you know, here's what we've done

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.760
 here is the relevant proof that we're making the best attempt. It's

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.410
 just it's not achievable based on the situation that we have or the

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.050
 equipment or even the people that I have. We're unable to make that

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.700
 you have to communicate that up and communicated up early. So that weighs

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.340
 certain things should be put in line to maybe help bring that

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.990
 team. Or maybe they reassess what they're asking you to do and realize

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.640
 that that actually is unachievable on where it's a big ask and nobody

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.280
 looked at it that way. And now that you've tried everything, you've

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.930
 put out several courses of action and you've tried all of those

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.570
 and they're not working. Maybe we need to reassess what's going on,

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.220
 so you might find that's helpful. Um, if it is achievable and you've

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.860
 just tried everything, um, than the next piece is, maybe you start

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.510
 to do a little bit of a counseling session with. If it is a particular

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.150
 individual and you've tried everything, you might have to do some

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.800
 counselling with them.
