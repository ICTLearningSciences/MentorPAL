00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.610
having if your team is having trouble meeting standards and you need to

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.360
 trying to get them there I mean there's different things you can do

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.120
 when the first things that I recommend is you know taking a pause

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.870
 taking a step back and reassess what's going on is there something that

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.630
 you're missing as a leader that maybe isn't necessarily coming down

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.390
 to their level to help them make that mission achievement is there

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.140
 something going on personally in their life that you're not aware

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.900
 of that has them you know not fully engage with their at work to make

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.650
 that mission accomplishment might find that after you talk with them

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.410
 that there is something going on personal and they're unable to

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.170
 focus and so that was the issue and so you can try and help them resolve

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.920
 that issue or get them to the people that can help them resolve

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.680
 that in that way it'll help hopefully bring them back online and get

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.430
 them focused again if you've kind of tried all that and you're you're

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.190
 basically at your wits and you really don't know what to do obviously

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.950
 need to communicate that on up and say listen here the steps that

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.700
 I've taken to try and help my team make this mission successful

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.460
 or meet mission objectives and we're just missing it tried ABCD any

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.220
 and we were you know here's what we've done here's the relevant proof

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.970
 that we're making the best attempt it's just it's not achievable based

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.730
 on the situation that we have or the equipment or even the people

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.480
 that I have were unable to make that you have to communicate that

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.240
 up and communicated up early so that way set certain things to be put

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.000
 in line to maybe help bring that team or maybe they re assess what

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.750
 they're asking you to do and and realize that that actually is unachievable

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.510
 and where it's a big ask and nobody looked at it that way

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.260
 and now that you've tried everything and you've put out several you

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.020
 know courses of action and you've tried all those and are not working

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.780
 maybe we need to re assess what's going on so you might find that's

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.530
 helpful if it is achievable and you've just tried everything then

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.290
 the next piece is maybe you start to do a little bit of a counseling

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.040
 session with if it a particular individual and you've tried everything

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.800
 you might have to do some counseling with them
