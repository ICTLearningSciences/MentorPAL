managing your career and family life effectively requires a very careful

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.520
 balance between the two you have to remember that eventually you

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.360
 are gonna leave the service you can't do it for ever so you don't want

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.200
 to be messing up your family lifestyle and having issues with that

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.030
 because you're always going to have your family the service is only

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.870
 gonna be there while you're in it you even when you're retired or

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.710
 you might still be some benefits sure maybe go down to the VFW for me

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.550
 from time to time but you know your family is always going to be either

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.380
 gonna be always responsible for them so you have to make sure

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.220
 that you're kind of doing a very good balancing act between your career

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.060
 your family life remember that your family's gonna be forever in

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.890
 your careers only momentarily you know in your in your life cycle
