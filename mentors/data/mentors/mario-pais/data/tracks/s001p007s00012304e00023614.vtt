00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.500
So I think the first steps that when you have a new leadership position,

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.160
 is obviously getting to understand your people first and understanding

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.810
 what their strengths and weaknesses are and how you can use those

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.470
 to progress not only their personal and professional development

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.120
 for but the group is a hole as long as the group is moving forward

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.780
 than that in turn is gonna allow the commands mission to move forward

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.430
 and increased mission readiness, which will then move the entire Navy's

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.090
 mission forward as well. And if every command is doing that, then

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.740
 the entire projection of the Navy is gonna be in a more positive

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.400
 direction. So you can see where that starts with the very most junior

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.050
 person and understanding what their strengths are and promoting those

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.710
 type of attributes and how that then rolls into the platoon or

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.360
 division or department that you work in and strengthens that entire

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.020
 organization. And then that, in turn and strengthens the command, moves

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.670
 on towards the rest of the fleet and then in turn, the Navy as a

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.330
 whole. So I think, you know, um, the very first steps is understanding

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.980
 what your junior personnel on the personal. It's your leading, whether

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.640
 they're junior or your peers or what have you, what their strengths

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.290
 and weaknesses are and what their direction, what influences

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.950
 them.
