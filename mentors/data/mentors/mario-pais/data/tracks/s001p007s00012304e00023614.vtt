00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.700
so I think the first steps that when you have a new leadership position

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.540
 is obviously getting to understand your people first and and understanding

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.390
 what their strengths and weaknesses are and how you can use

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.240
 those to progress not only their personal and professional development

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.090
 for but the group as a whole as long as the group is moving forward

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.930
 and that in turn is going to allow the commands mission to move

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.780
 forward and increase mission readiness which in and will then move the

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.630
 entire navy's mission forward as well and if every command is doing

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.480
 that then the the entire projection of the navy is going to be in

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.320
 a more positive direction so you can see where that starts with the

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.170
 very most junior person and understanding what their strengths are

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.020
 and promoting those type of attributes and how that then rolls into

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.870
 the platoon or division or department that you work and strengthens

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.710
 that entire organization and that in turn strengthens the command moves

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.560
 on towards the rest of the fleet and then in turn the navy as a

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.410
 whole so I think you know the very first steps is is understanding what

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.260
 your junior personnel on the personal at your leading whether their

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.100
 junior or your peers or what have you what their strengths and weaknesses

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.950
 are and what their direction what influences them
