00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.260
There's certain conduct issues that you know you don't want to deal with

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.670
 in house because it's gonna put not only that individual's career

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.080
 a jeopardy, but yours as well as the leader. You've got to figure out

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.500
 which ones need to get passed up. And which ones can you handle at

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.910
 your level? Ah, certain things like, um, you know, anything that has

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.320
 to do with domestic violence? Ah, crimes out in town or crimes against

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.730
 the organization. Um, those major type of things. That's not something

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.140
 that you want to keep it your level, that something needs to

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.550
 get elevated up for the command to understand and kind of take care

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.970
 of. And we'll relieve you from having that that overall burden. You

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.380
 don't want to be the only one with the secret because it's gonna come

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.790
 and bite you in the end
