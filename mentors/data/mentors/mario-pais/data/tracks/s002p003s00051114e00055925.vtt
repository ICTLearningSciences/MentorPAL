00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.550
So one way that you can, you know, improve morale if given. Ah, challenging

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.250
 task that's unexpected is it actually starts way ahead of that.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.950
 And that's you've got to kind of create foster a culture within your

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.650
 team that is used to having to deal with the unexpected, and they

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.350
 understand why they're having to do it in the long run. So, um, you

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.050
 know, when they do get throw these thrown these curveballs, they're

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.760
 used to that. And they understand that in the bigger scope, there's

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.460
 a reason why they're having to stay late to work on something last

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.160
 minute because they have to accomplish an overarching objective or mission

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.860
 or purpose. But the only way that you can get them to start thinking

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.560
 that way is by having already fostered that kind of culture

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.260
 earlier on, um, you know, prior to coming up with these these difficult

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.960
 situations
