00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.720
being a leader can't give you flexibility when it comes time to alter

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.580
 your work schedule. When you say your work schedule, I'm also implying

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.450
 that that's your teams watch scheduled. Obviously, you shouldn't

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.320
 be creating different working hours for yourself that aren't also aligned

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.190
 with your team's working hours. So you know if you're coming in

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.050
 late leaving early. But you're you're expecting your team to come

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.920
 in early and leave late. I mean, that's completely opposite of what

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.790
 should be happy. If anything is a leader, you should probably be the

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.660
 one that's there before everybody else on. More than likely, you're

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.520
 gonna be there after everybody leaves just to make sure everything's

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.390
 kind of buttoned up, close down and put away properly. So But, you

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.260
 know, as you move up in your leadership positions, you should be able

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.130
 to get more flexibility adjusting your working hours. You're still

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.990
 meeting mission objectives. A CZ well is balancing that that work

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.860
 in plate life stop
