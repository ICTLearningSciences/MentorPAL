00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.720
being a leader can give you flexibility when it comes time to alter your

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.580
 work schedule in when you say your work schedule also implying that

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.450
 that's your team's work schedule obviously you shouldn't be creating

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.320
 different working hours for yourself that are also online with your

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.190
 team's working hours so you know if you're coming in late and leaving

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.050
 early but you're you're expecting your team to come in early and

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.920
 leaving late I mean that's completely the opposite of what should

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.790
 be happening if anything is a leader you should probably be the one

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.660
 that's there before everybody else and more than likely you're going

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.520
 to be there after everybody leaves just to make sure everything's

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.390
 kind of buttoned up and close down and and put away properly so but

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.260
 you know as you move up in your leadership positions you should be able

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.130
 to get more flexibility in adjusting your working hours that you're

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.990
 still meeting mission objectives as well as balancing that that

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.860
