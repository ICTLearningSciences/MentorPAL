00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.780
the way that I handle fatigue at work is I just push through it to be

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.710
 honest you know it really depends on what's at hand if it's something

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.640
 it's extremely important that requires me to continue regardless if

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.570
 I'm fatigued or not I understand the bigger picture and I'll just

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.500
 keep driving Ford in it if it's something to where you know it okay

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.420
 obviously this is something that can wait till tomorrow and I'm getting

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.350
 fatigued then I'll probably take a break and I'll come back to that

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.280
 evolution the next day or more well rested and can probably provide

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.210
 a lot better response that situation and I could if I was fifty

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.140
 but depending upon it sometimes you just have to push through that fatigue

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.070
 recognize that weakness and an overstep it drive Ford
