00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.450
The way that I handled fatigue at work is I just pushed through it, to

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.050
 be honest, Um, you know, it really depends on what's at hand. If it's

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.660
 something, it's extremely important that requires me to continue

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.260
 regardless, if I'm fatigued or not, I understand the bigger picture,

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.860
 and I'll just keep driving forward in it. If it's something toe wear,

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.460
 you know? Okay, Obviously, this is something that can wait till tomorrow,

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.060
 and I'm getting fatigued. Then I'll probably take a break,

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.660
 and I'll come back to that evolution the next day or more well rested

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.270
 and can probably provide Ah, lot better response to that situation

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.870
 than I could if I was fatigued. But depending upon it, sometimes you

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.470
 just have to push through that fatigue, recognize that weakness and

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.070
 overstep it and drive forward
