00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.770
for me, the biggest risk that I've taken in my career is just the path

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.690
 that I've actually chosen to do. Um, you know, I'm not working as a

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.610
 traditional ht in the Navy's. I've been kind of working what some would

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.540
 say out of rate. Um, but it's it's paid off for me in the long

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.460
 run throughout my career. You know, even as a junior person, I would

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.380
 hear Oh, you're never If you continue on the path that you're doing,

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.300
 you're never gonna make Chief. And then I made it. And then I was

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.220
 up for orders and decided to continue working in a program that I was

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.140
 really good at. That people wanted me in and that I could continue

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.060
 to excel at, and I heard, Well, you're never gonna make senior Chief

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.980
 if you continue to go down this route. And then I made Senior Chief.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.910
 So, um, you know, I think working in the career that I've done was

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.830
 a risk that I took Ah, but it's worked out in the end for me, and

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.750
 I hope it continues to do so as I'm eligible for Master Chief this upcoming

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.670
 cycle
