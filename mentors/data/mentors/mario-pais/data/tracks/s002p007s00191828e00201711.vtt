00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.050
for me the biggest risks that I've taken in my career is just the path

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.250
 that I've actually chosen to do you know I'm not working as a traditional

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.450
 H. T. in the navy so I've been kind of working what some would

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.660
 say out of rate but it's it's paid off for me in the long run and

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.860
 throughout my career you know even as a junior person I would hear all

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.060
 you're never if you continue on the path that you're doing you're

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.260
 never gonna make chief and then I made it and then I was up for orders

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.460
 and decided to continue working in a program that I was really good

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.660
 at the people wanted me in and that I could continue to excel at

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.860
 and I heard well you're never gonna make senior chief if you continue

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.070
 to go down this route and then I made senior chief so are you I think

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.270
 working in the career that I've done was a wrist that I took but

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.470
 it's worked out in the end for me and I hope it continues to do so

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.670
 as I'm eligible for master chief this upcoming cycle
