00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.460
a way that you can tell on who you can really rely on is just observing

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.080
 those individuals during stressful situations. You're gonna be able

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.690
 to see you know who's ableto overcome that stress and who might buckle

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.310
 under the pressure and the people that buckle under that pressure,

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.920
 those air people that you probably aren't gonna be able to rely

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.530
 on very well. And maybe you need to work with them in order to bring

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.150
 them up and the folks where those stressful situations occur, and they're

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.760
 still able to move forward and stay focused and get the job done

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.380
 those of the individuals that you know you're gonna be able to rely

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.990
 on on future situation.
