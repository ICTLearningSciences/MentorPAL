00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.840
So one of the major benefits my job. What I think is great about it is

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.840
 just the diversity that you experience every single day. It's really

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.830
 not the same thing every single day. You're given many opportunities

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.830
 to kind of think on your own and be responsible. Even our most junior

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.820
 personnel, at a very early start in their career, are given tremendous

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.810
 responsibility where that's leading personnel or they're responsible

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.810
 for multimillion dollar worth of equipment. I don't think you

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.800
 can really find that in many other places, not even within the Navy,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.800
 at some points as well as in the civilian world. I mean, what civilian

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.790
 job do you know is going to give an 18 year old the ability to

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.790
 make critical decisions as well as being charge of millions of dollars

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.780
 worth of gear? That is gonna potentially cause impact or threat

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.770
 to not only friendly forces but to our enemy forces. So that's kind

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.770
 of one of the biggest benefits of working in this community is the

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.760
 fact that you're really given a lot of freedom and leeway and looked

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.760
 at as an intellectual adult who's able to make decisions and move the

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.750
 ball forward for progressing the force in the community
