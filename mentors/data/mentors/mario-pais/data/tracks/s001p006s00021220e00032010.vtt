00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.840
so one of the major benefits my job what I think is great about it is

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.840
 just the diversity that you experience every single day it's really

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.830
 not the same thing every single day you're given many opportunities

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.830
 to kind of think on your own and be responsible even our most junior

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.820
 personality very early start in their career are given tremendous responsibility

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.810
 where that's leading personnel or the responsible for

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.810
 multi million dollars worth of equipment I don't think you can really

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.800
 find that and many other places not even within the navy at some points

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.800
 as well as in the civilian world I mean what civilian job do you

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.790
 know is going to give an eighteen year old the ability to make you

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.790
 know critical decisions as well as be in charge of millions of dollars

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.780
 worth of gear that is gonna potentially cause impact or threat

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.770
 to not only friendly forces but to our enemy forces so that's kind of

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.770
 one of the biggest benefits of working in this community is the fact

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.760
 that you are really given a lot of freedom in the way and looked

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.760
 at as an intellectual adult who's able to make decisions and and moved

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.750
 the ball forward for progressing the force in the community
