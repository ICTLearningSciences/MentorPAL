00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.480
you should get your family involved very early in processing for your

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.110
 next career step because you have to remember they're part of this process

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:11.750
 as well. And if you're not having a good home life back at home

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.380
 with your family, that's gonna affect your work life as well. So

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.010
 you need to kind of communicate to them like what your overall objectives

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.640
 and goals are. What do you see yourself doing? Or you just gonna

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.270
 do this enlistment? But this contract, then leave the service? Are

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.900
 you intending on making this'll career, or do they know that they

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.540
 on board with that they support you? And the decisions that you're making

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.170
 is you need to involve them early on when you're making these

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.800
 decisions?
