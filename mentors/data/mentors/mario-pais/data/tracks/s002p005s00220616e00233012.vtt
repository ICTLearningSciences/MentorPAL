00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.850
when is breaking the rules okay it's kind of a loaded question but so

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.850
 I think before you can even attempt to try and break the rules you got

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.840
 a fully understand what they are first why were they put in place

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.840
 the reason behind that and are they even still applicables because

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.840
 you have no idea when those were actually written so you really really

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.840
 need to fully understand what the rules are before you start to try

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.840
 and break or bend them and then when you do decide that like you

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.830
 need to step outside the black and white start operating the gray you

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.830
 know what is the risk versus reward am I gonna cause damage to personnel

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.830
 or equipment am I willing to accept that risk is that gonna cause

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.830
 detriment to the mission overall if you find that you know those

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.830
 none of those apply and that in order for you to get to your objective

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.830
 because you're working in kind of this no man's land and it requires

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.820
 you to break the rules then go forward with it obviously you know

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.820
 try and get authorization first but if you happen to be in a situation

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.820
 where you're the one that needs to make that decision then make

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.820
 that executive decision after you've done a quick thought analysis

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.820
 and decided that I need to step outside the bounds here in order to

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.810
 get this accomplished and I'll deal with the consequences later so

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.810
 that's something that you really need to think about when you're starting

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.810
 to try and bend or break the rules
