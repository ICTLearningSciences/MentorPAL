00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.670
when is breaking the rules? Okay, um, it's kind of a loaded question,

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.480
 but so I think before you can even attempt to try and break the rules,

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.300
 you gotta fully understand what they are first. Why were they put

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.120
 in place? The reason behind that. And are they even still applicability?

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.930
 Because you have no idea when those were actually written. So

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.750
 you really, really need to fully understand what the rules are before

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.560
 you start to try and break or bend them. Ah, and then when you do,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.380
 decide that like you need to step outside the black and white, start

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.200
 operating in the gray. You know what is the risk versus reward? Am

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.010
 I gonna cause damage to personnel or equipment? Am I willing to accept

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.830
 that risk? Is that gonna cause detriment to the mission? Overall,

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.650
 if you find that you know that none of those apply Ah, and that in

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.460
 order for you to get to your objective because you're working and kind

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.280
 of this no man's land and it requires you to break the rules, then

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.100
 go forward with it. Obviously, you know, try and get authorization

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.910
 first, but if you happen to be in a situation where you're the one

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.730
 that needs to make that decision. Then make that executive decision

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.540
 after you've done a quick thought analysis and decided that I need

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.360
 to step outside the bounds here in order to get this accomplished, and

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.180
 I'll deal with the consequences later. Um, so that's something that

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.990
 you really need to think about when you're starting to try and bend

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.810
 or break the rules.
