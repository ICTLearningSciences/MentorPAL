I have a problem with actually taking work home with me a lot sometimes

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.140
 it's self imposed all times because I'm just trying to get ahead because

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.790
 I noticed something else you'd be coming up in the near future

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.430
 so if I can work on it ahead of time at home they were kind of alleviate

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.080
 some of the stress that I might have to deal with later down

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.730
 the line because I got a head start on it but a lot of that again is

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.370
 is is self imposed not necessarily necessary that I should be doing

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.020
 that at all
