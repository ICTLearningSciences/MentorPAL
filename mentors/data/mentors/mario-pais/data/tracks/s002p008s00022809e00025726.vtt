00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.500
I huh? Problem with actually taking work home with me a lot. Sometimes

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.140
 it's self imposed a lot of times because I'm just trying to get ahead

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.790
 because I know that something else is gonna be coming up in the near

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.430
 future. So if I can work on it ahead of time at home, they kind

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.080
 of alleviate some of the stress that I might have to do with later down

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.730
 the line, because I got a head start on it. But a lot of that again

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.370
 is self imposed, not necessarily necessary that I should be doing

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.020
 that at home.
