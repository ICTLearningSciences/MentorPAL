00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.180
so I think the coolest thing that I've done in the navy and then I still

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.510
 continue to do is working in the E. U. D. community originally was

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.840
 a marine mammal handler so working now and using dolphins and sea

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.170
 lions to find mines under the water or training shapes or enemy divers

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.490
 and swimmers so that was a pretty fun experience to now what I do

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.820
 which is using on man underwater vehicles or robots to find things

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.150
 under the water is so I've enjoyed doing that for the last eighteen

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.480
 years is probably been someone was fun activities I've I've got to do

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.810
