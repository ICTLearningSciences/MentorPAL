00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.180
So I think the coolest thing that I've done in the Navy ah, and that I

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.510
 still continue to do is working in the E u D community originally was

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.840
 a marine mammal handler so working on and using dolphins and sea

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.170
 lions to find mines under the water or training shapes or enemy divers

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.490
 and swimmers. So that was a pretty fun experience to now what I do,

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.820
 which is using unmanned underwater vehicles or robots to find things

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.150
 under the water. And so I've enjoyed doing that for the last 18

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.480
 years and has probably been some of most fun activities I've got to

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.810
 do.
