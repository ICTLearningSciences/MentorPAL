00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.450
the UV training that we do here is to prepare you. You ve platoons for

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.040
 deployment into theaters across the globe, ready to do major combat

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.640
 operations based on what the combatant commanders intent is. So we're

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.230
 gonna train this entire platoon to be able to operate in small units

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.830
 in austere environments in all kinds of weather, working off a small

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.430
 craft, using small vehicles and things of that nature in order

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.020
 to accomplish the overarching mission of finding, detecting, neutralizing

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.620
 and exploiting underwater mines and basically, anything else.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.210
 It's under the water that needs to be found or surveyed or searched.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.810
 That's what we're training, too.
