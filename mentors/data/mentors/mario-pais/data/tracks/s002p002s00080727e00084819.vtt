00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.570
Right now I'm getting my college degree through Columbia College of Missouri.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.290
 I've actually done several college classes with a variety of

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.010
 different colleges throughout my career. You know, the Navy has an

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.730
 agreement with certain colleges that they'll all accept each other's

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.450
 credits. So that way you're not necessarily pigeonholed to just going

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.170
 with one university or college, and then you move in. You know your

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.890
 stuff doesn't count anymore. So, you know, here in San Diego, Columbia

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.610
 College in Missouri has, ah satellite school here, and they've

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.330
 taken all my other credits from the other schools and universities

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.050
 that I've attended, and I'm currently pursuing my bachelors in business

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.770
 administration with them.
