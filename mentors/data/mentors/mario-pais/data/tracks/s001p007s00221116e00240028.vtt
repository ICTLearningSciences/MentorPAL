00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.050
my view of the line of work that I've done and how it's changed over time

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.240
 is that is becoming more relevant now than probably It was even

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.440
 five years ago, especially 10 15 years ago. So, for example, the line

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.640
 work that I was doing we used to use marine mammals to try and find,

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.830
 you know, unexploded ordinance, their minds under the water. And

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.030
 now we've moved forward to using unmanned underwater vehicles to do

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.230
 this line of work. So what that does is it reduces the risk to personnel

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.430
 because you're not having to put essentially people within a minefield

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.620
 or or animals in a minefield to find these things. They could

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.820
 be miles away. And you're still using equipment to do that, as well

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.020
 as its hoping to reduce that timeline that we have in mine countermeasures.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.210
 So as you know, things change as technology changes and also

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.410
 to I've noticed that the Navy and Department of Defense as a whole

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.610
 is starting to buy off on this entire you know, you you ve or unmanned

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.800
 systems realm. You can see everywhere from the president's national

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.000
 security strategy on down to the national defense strategy to our

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.200
 CEO knows maritime for superiority. You know, one point, Owen. Even

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.390
 2.0, documentation. All the overarching instructions that govern

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.590
 what we do is a Department of Defense. And as a naval forces, a hole

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.790
 is really starting to buy off on unmanned systems and moving forward

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.990
 in that direction because they realize that it can exponentially do

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.180
 more work than we can with people as well as it also is reducing risk

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.380
 to personnel, which is a good thing. So those were kind of some

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.580
 of things I've seen. Change when the technology has changed is that

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.770
 unmanned systems is becoming more relevant and what we do day to day

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.970
 throughout department defense as a whole.
