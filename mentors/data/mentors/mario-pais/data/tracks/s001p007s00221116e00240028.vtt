00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.050
my view of the line of work that I've done and how it's changed over time

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.240
 is that is becoming more relevant now than probably it was even

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.440
 five years ago especially ten fifteen years ago so for example the line

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.640
 of work that I was doing we used to use marine mammals to try and

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.830
 find you know unexploded ordnance and mines under the water and now

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.030
 we've moved forward using unmanned underwater vehicles to do this

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.230
 line of work so what that does is it you know reduces the risk of personnel

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.430
 because you're not having to put essentially people within a

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.620
 mine field oral or animals in a mine field to find these things they

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.820
 can be miles away and you're still using equipment to do that as well

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.020
 as it's helping to reduce that time line that we have in mind countermeasures

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.210
 so as you know things change as technology changes and

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.410
 also to I've noticed that the navy and department of defense as a whole

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.610
 is starting to buy off on this entire you know you you UV or unmanned

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.800
 systems round you can see everywhere from the president's national

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.000
 security strategy on down the national defense strategy to our

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.200
 senior knows maritime for superiority you know one point and even to

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.390
 point documentation all the over arching instructions that govern

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.590
 what we do as a department of defense and as a naval forces a hole is

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.790
 really starting to buy off on unmanned systems and moving forward

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.990
 in that direction because they realize that it can exponentially do

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.180
 more work than we can with people as well as it also is reducing wrist

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.380
 a person out which is a good thing so those are kind of some of things

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.580
 I've seen change when the technologies change is that unmanned

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.770
 systems is becoming more relevant and what we do day to day throughout

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.970
 partner defense as a whole
