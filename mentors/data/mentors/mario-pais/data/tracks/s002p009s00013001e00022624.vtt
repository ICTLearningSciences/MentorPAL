00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.870
one way that you could make paperwork go faster is trying. Just streamline

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.880
 the process and figure out areas to reduce those administrative

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.900
 burdens. I mean, that's a direct order. Coming from Department of Defense

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.920
 is the major priority for all forces globally is reducing administrative

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.930
 burdens. So if you find yourself doing certain paperwork

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.950
 that you feel is just not necessary anymore, maybe there's a better

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.970
 way. Maybe this can be automated or done via computer and sent via

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.980
 email as opposed to something I have to print out, sign and route. Then

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.000
 find those innovative solutions and bring those up to your chain

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.010
 of command. And they should be accepting of those, since they've got

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.030
 overarching guidance, you know, from the top down that we need as

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.050
 a whole to reduce those administrative burdens. So just figure out a

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.060
 way to streamline those processes and make things more automated. Um,

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.080
 Tiu reduce the time that is taking you for that paperwork
