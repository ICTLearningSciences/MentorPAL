00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.750
So what I think makes a good leader is somebody who is also a good listener.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.650
 In order for you to lead your people effectively, you also have

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.550
 to be able to understand and listen to what your people's needs are

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.450
 and understand what mission requirements are. You can't just automatically

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.350
 jump in immediately. Try and take hold of something and lead

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.260
 it from the get go, or else you're not gonna get any buy in from

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.160
 the personnel that you're trying to lead. So it's best to get together

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.060
 with them first and kind of understand what their challenges are,

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.960
 what their strengths are and then build from that and then not allow

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.860
 you to lead that entire group forward. So Choi is making a positive

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.760
 impact for the command, and the Navy is a hole.
