00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.750
so what I think makes a good leader is somebody who is also a good listener

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.650
 in order for you to lead your people effectively also have to

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.550

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.350

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.060

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.960
 their strengths are and then build from that and then not allow you

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.860
 to lead that entire group for such always making a positive impact for

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.760
 the command in the navy as a whole
