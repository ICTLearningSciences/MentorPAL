00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.810
one conflict that I had focusing on my career is opposed to family life

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.780
 was that I missed the birth of both of my kids. Do the fact that I

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.740
 was really focused on where I was out of my career. So when my daughter

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.700
 was being born, I was actually in training at the time, and they

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.660
 had asked me if I wanted to stop training and go home for her birth,

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.630
 be there at least for a week or two. And, you know, I kind of talked

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.590
 it over with my wife and declined that because I knew that if I

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.550
 had done that, it was gonna actually have com pounding effects were

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.520
 gonna push me back in a particular training cycle. Toe wear something

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.480
 that I should be graduating with was gonna now leave me there for

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.440
 another six months. What your turn was gonna affect when I could move

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.400
 my wife and now a new daughter out to where I was gonna be stationed

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.370
 ultimately. So I kind of weighed those pros and cons and felt that,

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.330
 you know, I should continue on with the training. The other time

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.290
 was on deployment. My wife was pregnant When I left, I knew that she

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.250
 was gonna be do while I was deployed. My command actually asked me

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.220
 if I wanted to skip out on the deployment and stay back, do something

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.180
 different and I declined. And then, while I was out on deployment

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.140
 and she had had the had our son, they asked if I wanted to go home for

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.110
 that. And I also declined having talked it over with her only because

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.070
 I knew that if I had left, it was gonna affect kind of mission

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.030
 outcome in the operations that were doing their theater. So I declined

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.990
 those retrospect. I mean, obviously, I miss being there for the birth

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.960
 of both my kids, but knows that was definitely a conflict that

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.920
 I had to deal with between home life and work life.
