00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.810
one conflict that I had we're focusing on my career as opposed to family

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.780
 life was that I missed the birth of both of my kids do the fact that

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.740
 I was really focused on where I was out of my career so you know

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.700
 when my daughter was being born I was actually in training at the time

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.660
 and they had asked me if I wanted to stop train and go home for

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.630
 her birth to be there at least for a week or two and you know I kind

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.590
 of talked it over with my wife and decline that because I knew that

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.550
 if I had done that it was going to actually have compounding effects

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.520
 were gonna push me back in a particular training cycle to wear something

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.480
 that I should be graduating with was gonna now leave me there

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.440
 for another six months which in turn is going to affect when I could

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.400
 move my wife and now a new daughter out to where I was going to be

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.370
 stationed alternately so I kind of weigh those pros and cons and felt

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.330
 that you know I should continue on with the training the other time

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.290
 was on deployment of my wife was pregnant when I left I knew that

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.250
 she was gonna be do while I was deployed my command actually asked

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.220
 me if I wanted to to skip out on the deployment and stay back and do

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.180
 something different and I declined and then while I was out on the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.140
 planet and she had the had or sign they asked if I wanted to go home

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.110
 for that and I also declined having talked it over with her only because

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.070
 I knew that if I had left it was going to facts kind of mission

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.030
 how common the operations that we were doing there in theater so I

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.990
 decline those retrospective me obviously I miss being there for the

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.960
 birth of both my kids but that was that was definitely a conflict that

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.920
 I had to deal with between home life and work life
