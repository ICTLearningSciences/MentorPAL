00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.730
I do know several individuals having worked in the navy that have either

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.610
 passed away or been seriously injured and just has to do with the

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.500
 kind of line of work that that were in in the communities that I've

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.380
 worked with now that's not very common with other jobs in the navy

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.260
 you know maybe you'll have somebody you know Dyer lose their life because

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.140
 of something out in town like a vehicle accident or something

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.020
 along those lines so really just kind of depends on the community that

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.910
 you're in for me personally yeah I'd I know quite a few folks that

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.790
 have passed away or been seriously injured but that's very specific

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.670
 to the line of work that we do
