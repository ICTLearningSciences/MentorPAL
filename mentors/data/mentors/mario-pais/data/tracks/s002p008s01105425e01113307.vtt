00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.730
I do know several individuals having worked in the Navy that have either

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.610
 passed away or been seriously injured. It just has to do with the

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.500
 kind of line of work that were in in the communities that I've worked

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.380
 with now that's not very common with other jobs in the Navy. You

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.260
 know, maybe you'll have somebody, uh, you know, die or lose their life

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.140
 because of, ah, something out in town, like a vehicle accident or

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.020
 something along those lines. So really just kind of depends on the

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.910
 community that you're in for me. Personally. Yeah, I know quite a few

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.790
 folks that have passed away have been seriously injured, but that's

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.670
 very specific to the line of work that we do.
