00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.650
some things that you should prioritize when you're picking housing is

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.450
 where's its proximity to your work? Do you want to live in a place that's

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.250
 super far away to where you're gonna have to have an hour or drive

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.050
 in tow work and then when you're leaving work which direction of

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.850
 flow is the traffic in the morning? You depend upon which way you

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.650
 have to head. It may be more advantageous to kind of try and find housing.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.450
 That's the opposite direction. That traffic usually is flowing

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.250
 those days. So that way you're not hit with rush hour traffic going

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.050
 into work and then hit with it when you're leaving work. So you know

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.850
 that's gonna be completely up to you. Some people like to live far

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.650
 away from work based on more rule areas, and other people enjoy kind

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.450
 of the downtown or city lifestyle. So that's gonna be a personal

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.250
 choice, but also to just look at its proximity to where you're gonna

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.050
 be working and how its best gonna serve you every day. Driving back

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.850
 from work
