00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.650
some things that you should prioritise when you're picking housing is

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.450
 worse its proximity to your work or do you want to live in a place that

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.250
 super far away to where you're going to have to have an hour or

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.050
 more drive in to work and then when you're leaving work which direction

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.850
 of flow is the traffic in the morning you know between depending

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.650
 upon which where you have to head it may be more advantageous to kind

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.450
 of try to find housing that's the opposite direction that traffic

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.250
 usually is flowing those days so that way you're not hit with rush

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.050
 hour traffic going into work and then hit with it when you're leaving

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.850
 work so you know that's going to be completely up to you some people

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.650
 like to live far away from work based on your order and more rule

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.450
 areas and other people enjoy kind of the downtown or city lifestyle

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.250
 so it's gonna be a personal choice but also to just look at its proximity

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.050
 to where you're gonna be working and how it's best gonna serve

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.850
 you every day driving back from work
