00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.070
so I think the biggest failure that I've ever had was starting up my career

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.280
 you originally came in to be see in the navy so after my initial

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.500
 a school training I went on to their basic underwater demolition

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.720
 school our buds where I was there for a couple months and then got to

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.930
 basically the third night of hell week and I didn't complete the program

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.150
 and so I've been or finished out of that hell week not completing

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.370
 it and and didn't graduate from buds after that and I was pretty

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.590
 devastated because that had been an initial dream a passion of mine

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.800
 for a very long time from there I kind of lucked out and was able

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.020
 to get into the EOD community now doesn't you D. technician but just

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.240
 working with the community as a marine mammal handler and I was still

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.450
 very young so I also noticed that my maturity level probably wasn't

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.670
 right at that time when I was trying to go through to become a seal

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.890
 and also I was newly married I had a child already another one on

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.100
 the way and so in retrospect looking back necessarily wasn't a bad

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.320
 decision of what happened and I actually learned a lot from that there's

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.540
 a lot of things that I even learned in the time that I was there

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.760
 that I've used since I've been in as far as you know value and integrity

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.970
 and leadership skills that I've taken with me and so you are

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.190
 even being devastated after that failure you know it's gonna happen

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.410
 you're able to bounce back from that and just find the silver lining

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.620
 in everything and then find a good situation that you're in and build

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.840
 on that please
