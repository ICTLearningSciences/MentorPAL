00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.070
So I think the biggest failure that I've ever had was starting out. My

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.280
 career originally came in to be seal in the Navy. So after my initial

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.500
 a school training, I went on to their basic underwater demolition

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.720
 school, or buds, where I was there for a couple months and then got

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.930
 to basically the third night of hell week. Um, and I didn't complete

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.150
 the program. And so I finished out of that hell week not completing

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.370
 it and didn't graduate from buds after that. Um, and I was pretty

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.590
 devastated because that had been an initial dream and passion of mine

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.800
 for a very long time. Um, from there I kind of looked out and was

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.020
 able to get into the E o D community, not as an e o d technician, but

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.240
 just working with the community as a marine mammal handler. And I

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.450
 was still very young. So I also noticed that my maturity level probably

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.670
 wasn't right at that time when I was trying to go through to become

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.890
 a seal. And also I was, uh, newly married. I had a child already

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.100
 another one on the way. And so in retro spec looking back necessarily

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.320
 wasn't a bad decision of what happened, and I actually learned a

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.540
 lot from that. There's a lot of things that I even learned in the time

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.760
 that I was there that I have used since I've been in a ce faras Ah,

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.970
 you know, value and integrity and leadership skills that I've taken

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.190
 with me. Um and so, you know, even being devastated after that failure,

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.410
 you know, it's gonna happen, and you're able to bounce back from

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.620
 that and just find the silver lining and everything and then find

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.840
 the good situation that you're in and build on that piece.
