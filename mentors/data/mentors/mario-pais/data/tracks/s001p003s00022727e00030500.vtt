00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.040
one thing that I try and lead by example on is work ethic I think you

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.230
 you know if you can show that you're putting forth an effort than the

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.430
 people that you're leading you're gonna want to do that as well as

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.620
 general reciprocity of of showing you know a particular behavior of

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.810
 people wanting to mimic that there's nothing that I will ask anyone

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.000
 that I'm leading to do that I myself have not already done before or

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.200
 willing to do so that's kind of the mentality that you need to have

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.390
 when you're when you're leading folks and and looking to get those

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.580
 examples
