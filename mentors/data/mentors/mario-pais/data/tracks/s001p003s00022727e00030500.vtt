00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.040
one thing that I try and lead by example on is, ah, work ethic. I think

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.230
 you know, if you can show that you're putting forth an effort than

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.430
 the people that you're leading, they're gonna want to do that as well.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.620
 That's the general reciprocity of showing, you know, particular

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.810
 behavior and people wanting to mimic that. There's nothing that I will

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.000
 ask anyone that I'm leading to do that I myself have not already

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.200
 done before or willing to do so. That's kind of the mentality that you

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.390
 need to have when you're when you're leading folks and looking Thio

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.580
 get those examples?
