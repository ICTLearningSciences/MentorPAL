00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.940
of the things that I've seen people spend their reenlistment bonuses on

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.030
 that have worked out well has been them taking that money and invest

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.120
 in themselves and investing in into some sort of financial vehicle

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.210
 whether that be mutual funds stocks are just a savings account the

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.300
 ones that I've seen take that nice large reenlistment bonus and go

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.390
 out by the most fanciest car or new TV or some sort of other tangible

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.470
 object that's going to immediately lose value the second you drive

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.560
 it off the lot for the second that you leave the store with it that

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.650
 hasn't worked out great for them the folks that have actually taken

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.740
 that money and then good stewards with that and that bonus input in

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.830
 in some sort of financial vehicle to make that money grow in the long

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.920
 run they it's worked out better for them
