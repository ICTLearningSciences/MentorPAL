00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.940
things that I've seen people spend their reenlistment bonuses on that

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.030
 have worked out well has been them taking that money and investing in

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.120
 themselves and investing it into some sort of financial vehicle, whether

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.210
 that be mutual funds, stocks or just a savings account, the ones

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.300
 that I've seen take that nice, large rainless man bonus and go out

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.390
 by the most fanciest car or a new TV or some sort of other tangible

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.470
 object that's gonna immediately lose value the second you drive it

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.560
 off the lot for the second that you leave the store with it. That

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.650
 hasn't worked out great for them. The folks that have actually taken

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.740
 that money and been good stewards with that that bonus and put it in

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.830
 some sort of financial vehicle to make that money grow in the long

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.920
 run. It's worked out better for them.
