00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.990
something that was probably the most challenging for me and my training

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.140
 and I've had a lot of training in a variety of different places around

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.280
 the world doing a variety of different things is probably just

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.430
 that time away from my family there are there it I've I've missed both

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.570
 of my kids being born because of training or deployment in so those

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.720
 are things you can never get back and so that's probably been the

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.860
 most challenging for me is that time away even though I do have an

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.010
 understanding family wife who's can can operate independently and two

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.150
 kids now that are in high school and are able to kind of work on their

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.300
 own they don't necessarily need me around all the time I still

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.440
 want to be there to see them you know grass and succeed in and help

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.590
 out and do the fatherly thing but they also understand that that's not

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.730
 always going to be the case work in a line of work that we do so

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.880
 but that doesn't mean to me is it still was a personal challenge was

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.020
 was being away from family during during training or deployments
