00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.740
something that was probably most challenging for me and my training. And

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.620
 I've had a lot of training in a variety of different places around

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.510
 the world, doing a variety of different things. It's probably just

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.390
 that time away from my family. Um, you know, I missed both of my kids

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.280
 being born because of training or a deployment. Um, and so those

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.160
 are things you can never get back, And so that's probably been the most

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.050
 challenging for me. Is that time away? Even though I do have an

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.940
 understanding family wife who's can can operate independently and two

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.820
 kids now that air in high school and are able to kind of work on their

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.710
 own, they don't necessarily need me around all the time. Um, I

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.590
 still want to be there to see them, you know, progress and succeed and

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.480
 help out and do the fatherly thing. But they also understand that

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.360
 that's not always gonna be the case working in the line of work that

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.250
 we do so. But that doesn't mean to me. It still was. A personal challenge

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.130
 was being away from family during during training or deployments
