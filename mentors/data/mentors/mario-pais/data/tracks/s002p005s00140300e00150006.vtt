00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.650
way that you can enforce an honor code is you've got to start creating

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.460
 that culture within your team early on holding people accountable and

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.260
 making sure that they hold themselves accountable you've got to build

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.070
 a team that's capable of having thick skin and that is able to

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.870
 take criticism if you know you notice that one of your teammates is

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.670
 doing something wrong or is messing up on something you've got to have

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.480
 the strength to tell them like Hey you're not doing this right and

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.280
 then they also got to be able to take your criticism and not feel

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.090
 that you're attacking them but you're only just trying to help them

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.890
 which is ultimately going to try and help improve the team so you've

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.690
 got a foster foster that that culture with in of accountability and

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.500
 having thick skin so that everyone can talk to one another because

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.300
 they ultimately no you're just trying to help them out as a teammate

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.110
 which is ultimately going to help the team and that feeds all the way

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.910
