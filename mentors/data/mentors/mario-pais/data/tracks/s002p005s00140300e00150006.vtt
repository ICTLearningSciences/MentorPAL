00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.650
a way that you could enforce an honor code is you've got to start creating

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.460
 that culture within your team early on, holding people accountable

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.260
 and making sure that they hold themselves accountable. You've got

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.070
 to build a team that's capable of having thick skin, and that is able

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.870
 to take criticism. If you know you noticed that one of your teammates

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.670
 is doing something wrong or is messing up on something, you've

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.480
 gotta have the strength to tell them like, Hey, you're not doing this

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.280
 right And then they also gotta be able to take your criticism and

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.090
 not feel that you're attacking them. But you're only just trying to

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.890
 help them, which is ultimately going to try and help improve the team.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.690
 So you've got a false foster that that culture within of accountability

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.500
 and having thick skin so that everyone can talk to one another

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.300
 because they ultimately know you're just trying to help them out

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.110
 as a teammate, which is ultimately gonna help the team, and that feeds

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.910
 all the way up
