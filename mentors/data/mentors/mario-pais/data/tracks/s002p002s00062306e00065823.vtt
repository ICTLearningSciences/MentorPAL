No, I don't think it's dangerous for the Dolphins and sea lines, and you

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.640
 d Actually, they have a better life working with us than they do.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.040
 If they were out in the wild, they get some of the best medical treatment.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.440
 Every day, they get medical checks, they get fed great, eh?

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.830
 Quality fish, the same kind of fish that they're served at, restaurants,

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.230
 these animals, air getting, um, they get great exercise. They really

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.620
 have no threats from predators. So no, I don't think there's there's

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.020
 kind of any threat or harm placed on those animals.
