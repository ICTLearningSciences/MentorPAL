00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.910
so you're gonna have some challenges when it comes to your leadership

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.960
 styles between military and civilian or even contractors are government

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.020
 employees no military a lot of times it's very cut and dry what

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.070
 you you can do with them in your leadership styles how you can award

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.130
 them and reward them as well as what you can do with them putatively

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.180
 when you start dealing with civilians or certain lines that you just

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.240
 can't cross that you might have to understand what their actual statement

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.290
 of work is and where they're lateral lines and limits are because

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.350
 what you think you could ask a military person to do they'll

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.400
 be able to do but a particular civilian whether government employer

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.460
 contractor is pretty much limited to what statement of work says that

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.510
 they can do I if you start asking them to do things out of that scope

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.570
 you can get them in trouble you can get yourself in trouble so you

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.620
 really got to understand you know what their limits are and then

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.680
 work around that and understand that you can't necessarily hold them

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.730
 to the same punitive standard as you could a military member but they

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.790
 also do have their avenues to where let's say you do have a civilian

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.840
 employee is not meeting the standards becoming difficult obviously

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.900
 you can't discipline them yourself you might have to go directly

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.950
 to their supervisor or the the the contract supervisor whoever their

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.010
 program manager is and begin to have that dialogue and say you're having

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.060
 difficulties with the civilian employee and what are the next

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.120
 steps you can do to rectify the situation
