00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.740
So you're gonna have some challenges when it comes to your leadership

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.620
 styles between military and civilian or even contractors or government

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.510
 employees. Military. A lot of times that's very cut and dry on what

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.390
 you you can do with them and your leadership styles, how you can

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.280
 award them and reward them as well as what you can do with them punitively.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.170
 Ah, when you start dealing with civilians, there's certain lines

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.050
 that you just can't cross. Ah, that you might have to understand

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.940
 what their actual statement of work is and where their lateral lines

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.830
 and limits are, because what you think you could ask a military person

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.710
 to do they will be able to do. But a particular civilian, whether

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.600
 government employee or contractor, is pretty much limited to what

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.480
 their statement of work says that they can dio. If you start asking

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.370
 them to do things out of that scope, you can get them in trouble.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.260
 You can get yourself in trouble so you really gotta understand. You

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.140
 know what their limits are and then work around that and understand

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.030
 that you can't necessarily hold them to the same punitive standard as

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.920
 you could. A military member, But they also do have their avenues

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.800
 to where Let's say you do have a civilian employee who is not meeting.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.690
 The standard is becoming difficult. Obviously, you can't discipline

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.570
 them yourself. You might have to go directly to their supervisor

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.460
 or the the contract supervisor, whoever their program manager is and

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.350
 begin to have that dialogue and say you're having difficulties with

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.230
 the civilian employees and what are the next steps that you can do

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.120
 to rectify the situation?
