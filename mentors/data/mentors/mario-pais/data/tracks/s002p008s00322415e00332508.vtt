00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.660
deciding when to own in deciding when to rent really has to do with you

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.470
 personally where you're at financially and how long you think you're

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.270
 gonna be in the area you know if you think that you're gonna be station

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.080
 a particular area for several years and financially you can accommodate

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.890
 owning your own place and I would probably recommend doing

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.700
 that there's a lot of benefits to being a homeowner financially as

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.510
 well as just personally and you know as you get ready to leave that

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.310
 area you have several options you can either rent your place out and

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.120
 continue to make income while you're paying the mortgage down or you

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.930
 can go and try and sell it or you might decide that you want to rent

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.740
 because it's easier it's actually may be cheaper maybe you don't

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.550
 need a home because you're single individual wants all you really need

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.360
 is a studio size apartment and you're able to get away with that

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.160
 or you're not going to be in that area long enough to where owning

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.970
 some place to live just doesn't financially makes sense then you're

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.780
 probably gonna want to rent instead
