00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.660
deciding window own and deciding when to rent really has to do with you

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.470
 personally where you're at financially. Ah, and how long you think

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.270
 you're gonna be in the area? You know, if you think that you're gonna

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.080
 be station a particular area for several years and financially you

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.890
 can accommodate owning your own place. And I would probably recommend

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.700
 doing that. There's a lot of benefit to being a homeowner financially

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.510
 as well as just personally. And, um, you know, as you get ready

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.310
 to leave that area, you have several options. You can either rent

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.120
 your place out and continue to make income while you're paying the mortgage

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.930
 down. Or you can go and try and sell it. Um, or you might decide

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.740
 that you want to rent because it's easier. It's actually may be

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.550
 cheaper. Maybe you don't need a home because you're single individual,

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.360
 and so all you really need is a studio size apartment, and you're

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.160
 able to get away with that or you're not gonna be in that area long

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.970
 enoughto where owning someplace to live just doesn't financially make

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.780
 sense. Then you're probably gonna want to rent instead
