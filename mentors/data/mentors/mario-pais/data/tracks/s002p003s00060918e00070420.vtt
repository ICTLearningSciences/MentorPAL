00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.080
the court team members that I've relied on in my inner circle as a leader

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.310
 has been everyone from the most junior guy up to, you know, the

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.550
 most senior person at my command. Everybody has something to offer you

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.780
 be surprised, even the most newest person that shows up, who might

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.010
 be the most junior person within the team. A lot of times they have

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.240
 very good ideas because they come from a different, diverse background

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.480
 that you never even thought of. And so you have got to be able

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.710
 to take that on and show that they have merit regardless of their rank.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.940
 Um, so I think everyone has something that they can provide is input.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.170
 And I lean on every single one of those people, whether it's my

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.410
 O p o, whether it's the deck plates, semen up to, you know, my department

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.640
 head and, um, you know, listening to what their perspective

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.870
 is and using their mentor ship to help drive me
