00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.080
the core team members that I've relied on in my inner circle as a leader

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.310
 has been everyone from the most junior guy up to you know the most

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.550
 senior person at my command everybody has something to offer you'd

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.780
 be surprised even than than most newest person that shows up who might

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.010
 be the most junior person within the team what times they have very

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.240
 good ideas because they come from a different diverse background

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.480
 that you never even thought of it so you've got to be able to take

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.710
 that on and ensure that they have merit regardless of their rank so

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.940
 I think everyone has something that they can provide his input and I

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.170
 lean on every single one of those people whether it's my PO whether

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.410
 it's the the deck plates semen up to you know my department head and

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.640
 you're listening to what their perspective is in using their mentor

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.870
 ship to help you know drive me
