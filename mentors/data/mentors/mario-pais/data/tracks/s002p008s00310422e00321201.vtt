00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.620
when you get to choose whether you're gonna live on base or off base is

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.380
 really depending on where you're getting station and the command that

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.150
 you're at so that some commands and depend upon the size of the

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.910
 command what they have is resources you may have to live on base or

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.680
 even on the ship until you reach a particular rank or you know you're

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.450
 married and have a have kids independence then you know you're gonna

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.210
 have that flexibility to live out of town but as a single individual

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.980
 independent pawn your rank you might be kind of forced to stay on

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.740
 base or live on the ship but also depend on your command one particular

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.510
 place I was stationed out we were a small unit and even you know

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.280
 the E. three is an E. fours that were single were able to still get

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.040
 basic allowance for housing and live out of town because the barracks

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.810
 that were on the basis that could not accommodate the people that

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.580
 were station with our unit and the particular working hours that

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.340
 we work they were unable to meet galley hours in order to get those

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.110
 rations at the galley so they're also given basic allowance for substance

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.870
 so it's really just depending on where your station and what your

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.640
 dependency situation is
