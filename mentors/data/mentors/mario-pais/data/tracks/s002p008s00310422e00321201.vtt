00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.620
when you get to choose whether you're gonna live on base or off base is

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.380
 really dependent on where you're getting stationed and the command

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.150
 that you're at. So that's some commands and depend upon the size of

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.910
 the command. What they have is resource is you may have to live on

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.680
 base or even on the ship until you reach a particular rank or, you know

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.450
 you're married and have, ah have kids independence than you know.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.210
 You're gonna have that flexibility to live out of town. But as a single

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.980
 individual independent upon your rank, you might be kind of forced

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.740
 to stay on base or live on the ship, but also is depending on your

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.510
 command. One particular place that I was stationed at, We're a small

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.280
 unit and even, you know, the E three's Andy Fours that were single

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.040
 were able to still get basic allowance for housing and live out

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.810
 of town because the barracks that were on the base just could not accommodate

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.580
 the people that were stationed with our unit and the particular

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.340
 working hours that we worked. They were unable to meet galley

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.110
 hours in order to get those rations at the galleys, so they were also

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.870
 given basic allowance for substance, So it's really just depending

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.640
 on where your station and what your dependency situation is.
