00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.860
so the priorities that I'd recommend for you if you're entering into a

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.860
 leadership position is read. You have to read a lot of things you need

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.870
 to read. You know what your commanders, guidance, mission, vision

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.870
 and intent is and then understand what his boss's intent is, you know,

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.880
 so that your Essex has their own, you know, guidance and mission

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.880
 and vision statement, and then continue to just trying to trickle

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.890
 up the line from his to your tight coms to then how that fits into the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.900
 CIA knows objective to the secretary of Defense's objective to then

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.900
 the president's objective. If you can understand from that ladder,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.910
 well, you know that was ladder rungs from you know, your boss all

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.910
 the way up to the president and understand how you fit into that as

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.920
 a leader. Then not only is gonna make you more effective in your own

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.930
 dated a job, but then you'll be able to effectively lead your people

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.930
 to accomplish those objectives that from the top all the way down

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.940
 have, um, and so you'll always be moving in the right direction and

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.940
 getting those those bigger objectives accomplished because you know

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.950
 how you fit into the overarching scheme of things. So that is probably

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.950
 my number. One recommendation for a priority is just get in there

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.960
 and read your commander's intent and guidance all the way up.
