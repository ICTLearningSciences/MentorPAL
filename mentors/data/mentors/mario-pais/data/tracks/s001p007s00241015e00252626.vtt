00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.860
so the priorities that I'd recommend for you if you're entering into a

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.860
 leadership position is is read you have to read a lot of things you

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.870
 need to read you know what your commander's guidance mission vision

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.870
 and intent is and I understand what his bosses intent is you know so

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.880
 that you're is six has it has their own you know guidance in mission

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.880
 and vision statement and then continue to just turn a trickle up

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.890
 the line from his to your tight calms today and how that fits into this

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.900
 you know is objective to the secretary of defense's objective to

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.900
 than the president's objective if you can understand from that latter

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.910
 well you know that that there was a ladder rungs from you know your

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.910
 boss all the way up to the president and understand how you fit into

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.920
 that as a leader then not only is gonna make you more effective

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.930
 in your own dated a job but then you'll be able to effectively lead

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.930
 your people to accomplish those objectives that you from the top all

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.940
 the way down have in so you'll always be moving in the right direction

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.940
 in getting those those bigger objectives accomplished because you

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.950
 know how you fit into the over arching scheme of things that is probably

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.950
 my number one recommendation for a priority is just get in there

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.960
 and read your commander's intent and guidance all the way up
