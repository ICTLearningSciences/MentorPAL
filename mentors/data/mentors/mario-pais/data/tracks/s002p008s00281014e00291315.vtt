00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.560
So if you're a parent, you've got to be very careful with using some of

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.260
 the techniques that you've learned and being a military leader with

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.970
 your family. Wow, that's not gonna come across appropriately with

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.680
 them. You know, I've had, ah, guys that I have known that, you know,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.380
 did ah, instructor duty. Whether it was at RTC is a, you know, drill

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.090
 instructor or being at, like, dive school is a dive school instructor

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.800
 where you're pretty aggressive with the way that you conduct business

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.500
 with students because you're trying to stress them. You're trying

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.210
 to put them through, ah, particular situation that's gonna come

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.910
 out with a better result. In the end, you can't go home and then use

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.620
 those same tactics that you were using with you No boot camp recruits

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.330
 or, ah, dive school student and use that on your son because he didn't

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.030
 make his bed. You know, you're gonna find that that is going to

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.740
 disrupt your family life. So you have to make sure, you know, you

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.450
 kind of separate, uh, your military life from your family life. And

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.150
 don't let those those techniques kind of blend over, or else you can.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.860
 You can end up with some issues
