00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.790
so if you're a parent you've got to be very careful with using some of

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.730
 the techniques that you've learned in being a military leader with

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.660
 your family all that's not gonna come across appropriately with them

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.600
 you know I've had guys that I've known that you know did instructor

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.540
 duty whether it was at RTC is a you know drill instructor or being

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.480
 at like dive schools a dive school instructor where you're pretty aggressive

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.420
 with the way that you conduct business with the students because

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.350
 you're trying to stress them trying to put them through a particular

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.290
 situation that's going to come out with a better result in the

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.230
 end you can't go home and then use those same tactics that you were

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.170
 using with you know boot camp recruits or a or a dive school student

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.110
 and use that on your son because he did make is bad you know you're

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.050
 gonna find that that is going to disrupt your family life so you

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.980
 have to make sure you you know you kind of separate your military life

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.920
 from your family life and don't let those those techniques conduct

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.860
