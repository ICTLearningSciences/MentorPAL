00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.300
some things that you might experience or that full fall through the cracks

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.750
 when you're gonna be moving is just the movement of your household

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.200
 goods. Ah, lot of times you'll have certain things scheduled, and

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.650
 the movers don't get there on time or it took them a little bit longer

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.090
 to pack up when they expected. And so they're leaving a little

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.540
 bit later, and then you're gonna show up to your new location, and perhaps

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.990
 you're waiting on your household goods to get there. And there

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.440
 it was, hiccups along the way with the movers to where their truck

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.890
 broke down. Or they had additional loads that needed to get so that

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.340
 the date that they originally projected as their delivery date of your

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.790
 household goods. Now it's gonna show up a few days or a week or

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.240
 maybe two weeks later. So you have to be kind of prepared for that.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.690
 I think about that ahead and say, Okay, if my stuff does not arrive

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.130
 on time, what am I gonna be able to do in the meantime until it gets

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.580
 here? And there's, you know, Service's and resource is out there That
