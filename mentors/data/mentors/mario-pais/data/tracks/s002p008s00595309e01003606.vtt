00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.760
so if I said I listened to from others that help me get advanced was understanding

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.660
 how the advancement process works you'd be surprised how

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.570
 many few people really quite understand how or what it takes to get

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.480
 advance you know who's looking at your record to that audience is

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.380
 what things you need to do what career milestones you should be heading

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.290
 how to separate yourself out from the pack and really make your

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.190
 your package as well as yourself shine and so you know some of the first

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.100
 advice I was given was making sure that you understand the evaluation

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.010
 process how to write good evaluations for not only yourself but

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.910
 your people because that's what's going to ultimately help you get

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.820
 advanced
