00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.760
some advice that I listened to from others that helped me get advanced

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.660
 was understanding how the advancement process works. You'd be surprised

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.570
 how many few people really quite understand how or what it takes

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.480
 to get advanced. Who's looking at your record? Who that audiences,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.380
 what things you need to do, what career milestones you should be hitting,

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.290
 how to separate yourself out from the pack and really make your

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.190
 package as well as yourself shine. And so you know, some of the first

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.100
 advice that I was given was making sure that you understand the

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.010
 evaluation process, how to write good evaluations for not only yourself

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.910
 but your people, because that's what's gonna ultimately help you

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.820
 get advanced.
