one way that you can connect more deeply with your team members is getting

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.750
 to know them, you know, on a personal level besides just professional.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.200
 So you know, if you know what kind of Moz them professionally,

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.650
 that's great. You can help drive drive their career in that path.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.100
 But then, if you kind of know what they're into personally, that's

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.550
 gonna allow you to build those kind of connections that will allow them

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.000
 to open up to you when you communicate, build those kind of trust

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.450
 relationships because you know about their family and their wife or

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.900
 husband or significant other, their kids or their dog or where they

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.350
 grew up, What they're even just their first name is how, when they

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.800
 graduate high school, did they graduate high school, these different

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.250
 kind of things I don't necessarily see that is intrusive leadership.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.700
 If you do it in the right way, you're not necessarily being intrusive.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.150
 You're just getting to know your people, which in turn is gonna

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.600
 build communication and build trust
