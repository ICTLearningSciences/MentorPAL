one way that you can connect more deeply with your team members is getting

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.750
 to know them you know on a personal level besides just professional

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.200
 so you know if you know what kind of moats them professionally

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.650
 that's great you can help drive drive their career in that path but

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.100

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.550
 you to build those kind of connections that ought to allow them to

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.000
 open up to you when you communicate build those kind of trust relationships

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.800
 high school did they graduate high school all these different kind of

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.250
 things I don't necessarily see that as intrusive leadership if you

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.700
 do it in the right way you're not really necessarily being intrusive

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.150
 you're just getting to know your people which in turn is going to

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.600
 build communication and build trust
