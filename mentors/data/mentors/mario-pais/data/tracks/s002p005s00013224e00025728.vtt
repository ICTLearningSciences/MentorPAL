00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.720
so I face a lot of different decisions as a leader in my organization

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.580
 and it's the kind of unique to the military is composed to are compared

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.450
 to the civilian sector you know the civilian sector there it you

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.310
 whether your manager leader you're pretty much primarily concerned

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:20.180
 with getting the business moving forward in those kind of things are

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.040
 as in the military not only are you worried about mission a success

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.910
 and you know the operations but you also have to deal with the personal

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.770
 professional development of your people and in making sure that

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.640
 they're taking care of an actually looking into you know not only their

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.500
 per you know like the personal life like their family but are they

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.370
 moving in the right direction to progress their career and so you

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.240
 know it one day I can be dealing with making sure that we've got all

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.100
 the equipment necessary to go out and conduct high risk evolution

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.970
 or operation to making sure that the most junior persons family or

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.830
 wife is being able to get taken care of at tri care because they're

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.700
 having issues with medical or dental or how do they even go about doing

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.560
 that or register in a car because they just checked into this new

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.430
 command and they're coming from overseas duty that's something that's

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.290
 unique that you experience in the military but you won't see in

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.160
 the civilian sector and so you know you've got to be ready to deal with

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.020
 that entire gambit of of leadership as well as issues that are gonna

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.890
 come across to you
