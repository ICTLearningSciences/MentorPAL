00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.720
So I faced a lot of different decisions as a leader in my organization,

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.580
 and it's the kind of unique to the military is composed to our compared

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.450
 to the civilian sector. You know, the civilian sector there. Whether

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.310
 you're a manager leader, you're pretty much primarily concerned

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:20.180
 with getting the business moving forward and those kind of things.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.040
 Or as in the military, not only are you worried about mission's success

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.910
 and you know the operations, but you also have to deal with the

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.770
 personal professional development of your people, Um, and making sure

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.640
 that they're taking care of and actually looking into, you know,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.500
 not only their particular, like the personal life, like their family,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.370
 but are they moving in the right direction to progress their career.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.240
 And so you know, one day I could be dealing with making sure that

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.100
 we've got all the equipment necessary to go out and conduct ah, high

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.970
 risk evolution or operation to making sure that the most junior person's

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.830
 family or wife is being able to get taken care of that tri care

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.700
 because they're having issues with medical or dental, Or how do

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.560
 they even go about doing that or registering a car cause they just checked

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.430
 into this new command and they're coming from overseas duty.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.290
 That's something that's unique that you experience in the military that

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.160
 you won't see in the civilian sector. And so, you know, you've got

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.020
 to be ready to deal with that entire gambit of of, ah, leadership

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.890
 as well as issues that are gonna come across to you.
