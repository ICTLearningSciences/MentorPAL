00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.780
So what really makes change in a team, especially if it's a big change,

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.710
 is is getting that buy in from the folks that you're leading. You've

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.640
 got to be able to show them the reality of what that changes, whether

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.570
 it's good or bad and, you know, explain to them what the overarching

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.500
 goal is and why, in the long run, it's probably gonna be the biggest

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.430
 benefit. Have those discussions not everyone is gonna is gonna

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.360
 buy in on that change. You know, some people are very adaptive to

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.300
 change and enjoy change and other people hate change. You gotta understand

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.230
 where people think and where they lie and then kind of play to

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.160
 those roles. But your role is the leader is whether it's everyone

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.090
 agrees or doesn't agree. At the end of the day, they still have to move

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.020
 forward with this. Change is coming down from somewhere. It's a

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.950
 new priority, and probably in the long run it's gonna be it's gonna

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.880
 be better. Um, help them out as well as the Navy is a hole, so you have

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.810
 to kind of play to that rule
