00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.780
so what really makes changing a team especially if it's a big change is

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.710
 is getting that by and from the folks at your leading up you've got

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.640
 to be able to show them the reality of what that changes whether it's

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.570
 good or bad and you know explain to them what the over arching goal

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.500
 is and why in the long run it's probably gonna be the biggest benefit

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.430
 have those discussions not everyone is gonna is gonna buy in on

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.360
 that change you know some people are very adaptive to change and enjoy

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.300
 change and other people hate change you gotta understand where

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.230
 people thinking where they lie and then kind of played in those roles

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.160
 but your role as the leader is whether it's you know everyone agrees

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.090
 are doesn't agree at the end of the day you still have to move forward

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.020
 with this change is coming down from somewhere it's a new priority

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.950
 and probably in the long run it's going to be it's going to be

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.880
 better help them out as well as the navy as a whole so you have to kind

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.810
 of play that role
