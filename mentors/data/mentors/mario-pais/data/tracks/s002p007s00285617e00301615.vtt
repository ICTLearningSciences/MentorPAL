00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.490
so a way that all, uh, deal with an increase in tempo is all. First identify.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.120
 Why are we having this increase and is it achievable? And if

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.760
 it's something that I know that I can take on for another extended

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.390
 period of time and meet those requirements because the tempos increased

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.030
 and I'll continue with it and I'll try and foster that same culture

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.660
 morale throughout the team that I'm working with but also to I got

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.300
 to recognize when there is too much in that, possibly that temple

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.930
 is gonna either start breaking me down or other individuals in my team

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.570
 and recognizing everybody's certain level of being able to accept

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.200
 an increase in that tempo, some people can take on more than others.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.840
 Some people they are able to deal with stressful situations. Ah,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.480
 better than others and other people need a little bit more time or need

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.110
 a break before they can. They can get their tempo increased, so

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.750
 you have to recognize that as a leader within your people figure out

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.380
 when to make those decisions and then just be vocal about it as well.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.020
 If you're noticing that increase in tempo and it's going to have

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.650
 ah long lasting or detrimental effects on you and your team. You've

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.290
 gotta let folks know that you know, you're gonna have a hard time meeting

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.920
 this increased tempo because a lot of times they might not even

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.560
 be aware if they've piled on this. This increase to you that your

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.190
 it's something that you just can't achieve until you voice your opinion

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.830
 and let it be known.
