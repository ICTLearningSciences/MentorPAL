00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.490
so with that all deal with an increase in tempo is off first identify

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.120
 why are we having this increase and is it achievable and if it's something

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.760
 that I know that I can take on for another extended period of

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.390
 time and and meet those requirements because the tempos increase and

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.030
 I'll continue with it and I'll try and foster that same culture morale

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.660
 throughout the team that I'm working with but also to I got to

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.300
 recognize when there is too much and that possibly that temple is going

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.930
 to either start breaking me down or other individuals in my team

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.570
 and recognizing everybody certain level of being able to accept an

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.200
 increase in that tempo some people can take on more than others some

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.840
 people they are able to deal with stressful situations better than

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.480
 others and other people need a little bit more time or need a break

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.110
 before they can they can get their temple increased so you have to recognize

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.750
 that as a leader within your people figure out when to make

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.380
 those decisions and then just be vocal about it as well if you're noticing

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.020
 that increase in tempo and it's going to have long lasting or

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.650
 detrimental effects on you and your team you've got to let folks know

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.290
 that you know you're gonna have a hard time meeting this increased

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.920
 tempo because a lot of times they might not even be aware if they

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.560
 piled on this this increase to you that your it's something that you

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.190
 just can't achieve until you voice your opinion and let it be known

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.830
