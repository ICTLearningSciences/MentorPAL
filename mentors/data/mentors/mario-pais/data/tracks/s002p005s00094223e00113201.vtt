00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.240
some important factors when making decision. And that you want to consider,

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.630
 I think, is ultimately is the juice worth the squeeze, you know,

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.020
 is the risk worth eyes, the reward worth the risk you need to look

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.410
 at? What is the desired end state? What is the actual desired intent

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.810
 at the end? And then kind of work your way backwards from that to

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.200
 figure out what it is you're gonna need in order to achieve that that

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.590
 objective and make those decisions? And then, ultimately, is it even

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.980
 worth moving forward in that path? Once I've discovered of all the

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.370
 other stuff that I've got to think about in the planning that's involved?

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.760
 What are some secret sauce tips for your leadership style?

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.150
 Some secret sauce tips for my leadership style would be, you know, be

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.540
 an active listener. Communicate properly. Ah, be relatable to the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.940
 folks that you're leading so that they have trust in you and that they

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.330
 feel that they can come to you and talk to you about situations that

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.720
 you'll value their opinion. Um, and don't be afraid Thio to do the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.110
 dirty work either. Um, I've found a lot of times you know you if

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.500
 you're a leader and let's say it's time to do cleanup, you know, don't

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.890
 just ask your folks to do clean up, go out and grab the broom yourself

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.280
 and help start sweeping. You'd be surprised how many other people

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.670
 are going to join when they see you as the leader out there sweeping

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.070
 up the P way or cleaning up something everyone else wants to join

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.460
 in because they're like, Wow, if he's willing to do this, what am

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.850
 I doing? You know, and then that also shows your folks that you're

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.240
 relatable and that you're able to get down to that level, and it builds

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.630
 that trust.
