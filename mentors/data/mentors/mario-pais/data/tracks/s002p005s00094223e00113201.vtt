00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.420
some important factors when making decision and that you want to consider

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.000
 I think is ultimately is the juice work the squeeze you know is

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.570
 the risk worth is the reward worth the risk you need to look at what

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.150
 is the desired end state what is the actual desired intent at the end

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.720
 and then kind of work your way backwards from that to figure out

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.290
 what it is you're gonna need in order to achieve that that objective

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.870
 and make those decisions and then ultimately is it even worth moving

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.440
 forward in that path once I've discovered over all the other stuff

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.020
 that I've got to think about in the planning that's involved what are

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.590
 some secret sauce tips for your leadership style some secret sauce

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.170
 tips for my leadership style would be you know be an active listener

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.740
 communicate properly be relatable to the folks that you're leading

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.310
 so that they have trust in you and that they feel that they can come

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.890
 to you and talk to you about situations that you value their opinion

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.460
 and don't be afraid to to do the dirty work either I've found a

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.040
 lot of times you know you if you're a leader in let's say it's time

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.610

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.180
 and grab the broom yourself and help start sweeping you'd be surprised

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.760

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.910
