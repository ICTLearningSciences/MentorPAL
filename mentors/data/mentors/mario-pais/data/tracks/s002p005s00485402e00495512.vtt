00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.440
people leave the navy for a variety of reasons summer just out of your

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.040
 control some are the individual and only intended on join in and doing

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.630
 for years and moving on because they just wanted something different

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.230
 they wanted that experience and maybe they wanted the benefits

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.820
 that came with being in the navy and some of those that they'll get

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.410
 going out so you can't feel that you know you have to try and keep everyone

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.010
 in service because you have no idea what that person's ultimate

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.600
 goals and objectives are just have to find out what the real what

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.200
 they are and then help get them to achieve that of other people leave

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.790
 the navy because they just got disenchanted with it maybe they had

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.390
 a bad experience and they no longer want to be part of the organization

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.980
 and that's unfortunate hopefully you're not the one that caused

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.570
 that feeling in that individual to where they wanted to leave the

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.170
 service but you know people leave for a variety of reasons summer controllable

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.760
 some aren't you just have to figure out what motivates everybody

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.360
 on your team and help them get to their goals that they wanted

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.950
