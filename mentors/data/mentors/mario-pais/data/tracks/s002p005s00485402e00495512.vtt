00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.440
people leave the Navy for a variety of reasons. Um, summer just out of

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.040
 your control. Some are the individual and only intended on joining

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.630
 and doing four years than moving on because they just wanted something

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.230
 different. They wanted that experience, and maybe they wanted the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.820
 benefits that came with being in the Navy and some of those that they'll

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.410
 get going out. So you can't feel that you know, you have to try

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.010
 and keep everyone in service because you have no idea what that person's

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.600
 ultimate goals and objectives are. Just have to find out what

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.200
 the what they are and then helped get them to achieve that. Um, other

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.790
 people leave the Navy because they just got disenchanted with it.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.390
 Maybe they had a bad experience and they no longer want to be part

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.980
 of the organization. And that's unfortunate. Hopefully, you're not the

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.570
 one that caused that feeling in that individual to where they wanted

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.170
 to leave the service. But, you know, people leave for a variety

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.760
 of reasons. Some are controllable, some aren't. You just have to figure

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.360
 out what motivates everybody on your team and help them get to their

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.950
 goals that they want to do
