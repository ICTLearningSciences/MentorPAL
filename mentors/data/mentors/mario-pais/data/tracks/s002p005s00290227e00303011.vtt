WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.030
in particular. Situation that comes to mind when my team and I had a disagreement

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.220
 on how to handle something was when I was on recruiting

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.400
 duty. Um, I was working with a particular applicant who we thought were

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.580
 is going to be ready to process. Ah, but that individual ended up

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.760
 having some personal issues that kind of prevented them from getting

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.950
 the maps on time for them to conduct the physical and then eventually

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.130
 signed the contract and come into the delayed entry program. Um,

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.310
 I had to explain to the rest of my team, including the supervisor

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.500
 at the time that this individual just is not ready to go over there

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.680
 because they're having some significant personal issues which I discussed

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.860
 with them. Um, however, the team still felt that those were things

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.040
 that we could work around that individual could still go on. The

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.230
 day that we had decided so that they could come in and enjoy and be

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.410
 marked off is ah, accounting contract. I kind of stood by what I needed

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.590
 to do and protected that individual. Um, I got a lot of flak for

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.780
 it over the following week, you know, after all, the stuff had subsided.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.960
 We were able to get that individual in the contract still counted

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.140
 for for the month, which is what we're looking for. We had a particular

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.320
 goal we had to achieve that month. Um, but, you know, we were

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.510
 there arguing for quite a bit, and, um, I really had to stand my

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.690
 ground on that and ended up being the right outcome.
