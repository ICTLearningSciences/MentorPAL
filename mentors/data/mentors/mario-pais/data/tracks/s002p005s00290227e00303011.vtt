00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.030
one particular situation that comes to mind when my team and I had a disagreement

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.220
 on how to hit how to handle something was when I was on

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.400
 recruiting duty I was working with a particular applicant who we thought

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.580
 we're is going to be ready to process but that individual ended

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.760
 up having some personal issues that kind of prevented them from getting

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.950
 the maps on time for them to conduct the physical and then eventually

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.130
 signed the contract and come into the delayed entry program I

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.310
 had to explain to the rest of my team including the supervisor at the

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.500
 time that this individual just is not ready to go over there because

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.680
 they're having some significant personal issues which I discussed

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.860
 with them however the team still felt that those were things that

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.040
 we could work around that individual could still go on the day that

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.230
 we had decided so that they can come in and join and be marked off as

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.410
 a as accounting contract I kind of stood by what I needed to do and

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.590
 and protected that individual I got a lot of Flack for it however

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.780
 the following week note after all the stuff it subsided we were able

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.960
 to get that individual in the contract still counted for the for the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.140
 month which is what we're looking for we had a particular goal we

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.320
 had to achieve that month but you know we were there arguing for quite

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.510
 a bit and I really had to stand my ground on that and it ended up

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.690
 being the right outcome
