00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.560
in the community that I work in. Um, you know, if you fail but you've

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.270
 actually shown that you've applied all your effort, you've made a valiant

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.980
 attempt to be successful. They're okay with that. I mean, one

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.690
 of our monikers here is fail fast and wing and win big. So, you know,

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.410
 failure is okay as long as you've put forth all the effort and you're

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.120
 really trying, especially if it's something that's new. It's a navigated

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.830
 waters that you're doing for the first time and you thought

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.540
 you put forth your best effort, Then you fail at it. Okay, Let's learn

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.250
 from that. And let's figure out how we can get past that and continue

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.960
 to move on.
