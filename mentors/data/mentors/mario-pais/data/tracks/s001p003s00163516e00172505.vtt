00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.410
depending upon where you going, where you're working, you're gonna always

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.980
 deal with different types of personalities. Type A's all the way

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.540
 down, right? You know, if you're working in Maur of, ah, specialized

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.100
 community, you're gonna find a lot more type A personalities, people

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.670
 that do not want to fail, that air driven to success driven toe win

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.230
 another place that you're gonna work. Sometimes people are content

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.790
 with mediocrity C and only doing what needs to be done to go home

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.360
 for the day. You've got to understand what drives people, what their

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.920
 influences are and then work with them at their level. It's gonna be

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.490
 very challenging to try and turn somebody from one personality type,

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.050
 toe another. Um, so you have to kind of work with where they're at

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.610
 and understand those types and find out what their strengths and weaknesses

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.180
 are and build them up. And then as long as you move towards

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.740
 that common goal
