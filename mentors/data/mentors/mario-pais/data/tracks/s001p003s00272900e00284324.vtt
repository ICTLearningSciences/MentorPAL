00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.220
there was so many different ways in the Navy that you can reward your

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.600
 sailors for good performance. What you first have to do is just figure

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.970
 out what motivates your people, because what motivates one person

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.350
 is going to be different from somebody else. If I've got somebody who's

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.720
 been performing really well and I know that they, uh, enjoy time

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.100
 off, then that might be. What I reward them with is an extra day off.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.470
 We're going home earlier. Something like that. If I've got another

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.850
 individual who doesn't really care about time off because they're

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.220
 really driven and just like toe work and perform, maybe I actually

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.600
 give him more responsibility, because that's what they have been seeking.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.970
 They want to show that they're capable of taking on more. So I

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.340
 give them that might have other individuals that are really, you know,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.720
 looking for that kind of award or credit or something. So put him

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.090
 in for the award s o. You have to really just understand what drives

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.470
 and motivates each one of those individuals and then, you know, work

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.840
 towards that whenever they're doing good things. But always let

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.220
 your people know when they're doing something good. You know, even just

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.590
 that, that subtle in the middle of the day. Hey, you're really doing

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.970
 You know, I appreciate what you're doing. Or that looks great.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.340
 Even just that single comment when they've been working hard like that

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.720
 looks great. Er, you're really doing well there. That might be enough

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.090
 to continue to push them on to finish that evolution.
