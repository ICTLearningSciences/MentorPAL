00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.220
there are so many different ways in the navy that you can reward your

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.600
 sailors for good performance when you first have to do is just figure

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.970
 out what motivates your people you know because what motivates one

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.350
 person is gonna be different from somebody else if I've got somebody

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.720
 who's been performing really well and I know that they enjoy time

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.100
 off then that might be what I reward them with his an extra day off

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.470
 we're going home early or something like that if I got another individual

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.850
 who doesn't really care about time off because they're really

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.220
 driven and just like to work and perform up maybe I actually given more

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.600
 responsibility because that's what they're been seeking they want

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.970
 to show that they're capable of taking on more so I give them that

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.340
 might have other individuals that are really you know looking for that

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.720
 kind of a ward or credit or something so put him in for the award

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.090
 so you you have to really just understand what drives a motive each

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.470
 each one of those individuals and then you know work towards that

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.840
 whenever they're doing good things but always let your people know when

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.220
 they're doing something good you know even just that that subtle

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.590
 it in the middle of the day Hey really doing you know I appreciate

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.970
 what you're doing or that looks great even just that single comment

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.340
 when they've been working hard like that looks great are you really

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.720
 doing well there that might be enough to continue to push them on to

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.090
 finish that evolution
