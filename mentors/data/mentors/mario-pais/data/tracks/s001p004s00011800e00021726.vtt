you you V. stands for unmanned underwater vehicle and essentially it's

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.320
 it's a robot an underwater robot that can be used to do a variety of

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.550
 things under the water summer programmed with side scan sonar to survey

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.780
 a bottom area looking for anything from mines to ship racks sunken

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.010
 aircraft you anything that's been lost under the water to collecting

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.250
 environmental information like bathymetry or temperature salinity

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.480
 or all the other kind of environmental factors that are under the

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.710
 ocean surface there it's a it's you program it so doesn't necessarily

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.950
 need to have somebody operating it entirely it's not tethered you

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.180
 since the program the vehicle you can send it out on its way it runs

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.410
 this pre programmed mission then you recover it you can download

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.640
 the data and then interpret that data depend upon what sensors you had

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.880
 attached to the vehicle what your overall mission requirements are

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.110
