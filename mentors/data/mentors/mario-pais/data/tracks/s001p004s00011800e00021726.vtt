U U V stands for unmanned underwater vehicle. Essentially, it's Ah, it's

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.320
 a robot, an underwater robot that can be used to do a variety of

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.550
 things under the water. Some are programmed with side scan sonar to

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.780
 survey a bottom area looking for anything from mines to shipwrecks.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.010
 Sunken aircraft. Um, anything that's been lost under the water to collecting

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.250
 environmental information like the thim, a tree or temperature,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.480
 salinity, or all the other kind of environmental factors that are

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.710
 under the ocean surface. There, it's, Ah, it's you program it so

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.950
 it doesn't necessarily need to have somebody operating it entirely.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.180
 It's not tethered. You essentially program the vehicle. You can send

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.410
 it out on its way. It runs this pre programmed mission. Then you recover

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.640
 it. You can download the data and then interpret that data depending

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.880
 upon what sensors you had attached to the vehicle, what your

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.110
 overall mission requirements are
