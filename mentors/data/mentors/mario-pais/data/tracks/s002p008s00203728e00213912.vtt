00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.490
things that you should get ready before you deploy is gonna be your your

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.130
 household stuff so what are you gonna do with your household goods

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.760
 when you deploy if you're single individual more than likely you're

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.400
 gonna wanna pack all that stuff up and move it into a storage unit

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.040
 so that way you're not paying rent on a place that you're not living

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.680
 in anymore for six seven eight months however long you're on deployment

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.310
 that's money that you could essentially be pocketing in saving

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.950
 also to your finances so you want to make sure your financial stuff

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.590
 is in order do you have certain bills that need to be paid get those

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.230
 paid off also to is there gonna be reoccurring bills that you're gonna

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.860
 be responsible for paying how are you gonna pay those does it pay

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.500
 automatically or do you need to set up some sort of a lot meant to

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.140
 pay those wire on deployment because you may have connective itty

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.780
 issues and being able to pay things on time you just you don't want

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.410
 to leave any stone unturned that you're gone for an extended period

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.050
 of time that when you come back you end up with a bunch of different

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.690
 issues that you you didn't prepare for an advance
