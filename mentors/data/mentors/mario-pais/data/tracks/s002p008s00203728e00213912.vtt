00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.490
things that you should get ready before you deploy is gonna be your household

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.130
 stuff. So what are you gonna do with your household goods when

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.760
 you deploy? If you're single individual, more than likely you're

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.400
 gonna want to pack all that stuff up and move it into a storage unit.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.040
 So that what? You're not paying rent on a place that you're not living

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.680
 in anymore for 678 months over long your own deployment. That's

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.310
 money that you could essentially be pocketing in saving, um, also to

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.950
 your finances. So you want to make sure your financial stuff is in

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.590
 order? Do you have certain bills that need to be paid? Uh, get those

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.230
 paid off also, too. Is there gonna be re occurring bills that you're

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.860
 gonna be responsible for paying? How are you gonna pay those? Does

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.500
 it pay automatically? Or do you need to set up some sort of allotment

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.140
 to pay those while you're on deployment? Because you may have connective

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.780
 ity issues and being able to pay things on time. You just you

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.410
 don't want to leave any stone unturned that you're gone for an extended

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.050
 period of time that when you come back, you end up with a bunch

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.690
 of different issues that you didn't prepare for in advance
