00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.410
the way that you can recover from a professional bump in the road is one.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.970
 Don't let it define you. Let it, you know, learn from it, understand

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.520
 that it happened. Take ownership of it and acknowledge that it's

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.080
 happened. But then learn from those mistakes and keep moving. If you

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.640
 constantly dwell on that professional bump, then you're gonna find

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.200
 that it's just going to continue to compound and snowball into other

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.750
 ones that you're gonna continue to have. And it's a lingering. It's

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.310
 a lingering effect, so don't let it define you and move on from it,

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.870
 but learn from it.
