00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.630
so the way that the way that I set the tone as a leader within the platoons

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.420
 or divisions and even departments that I've led is one as kind

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.200
 of Ah is very open and fluid. I enjoyed a have, you know, face to face

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.990
 conversations with individuals. My door's always left open. Anyone

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.770
 that works with me understands that they can come in and talk to

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.550
 me at any time, and we'll hash it out. If for some reason I can't really

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.340
 give them land divided attention at that moment, we'll set up another

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.120
 time to do that. But then when we do talk, it's very candid.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.910
 I like to try and break down that hierarchy structure where, you know,

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.690
 maybe they see me as their leader chief, and they might just be the

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.470
 E three. I like to get very personal because that way the individual

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.260
 feels like they can open up more as opposed to trying to be a little

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.040
 stifled because they see this or you know, the chief from your

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.820
 lurking over them. And that's not necessarily the best wayto kind of

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.610
 open up that dialogue, and then when you open up that dialogue and

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.390
 you begin to understand what makes these people tick, then you can kind

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.180
 of help develop and guide their path and career into the direction

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.960
 that it needs to be with with their buying.
