00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.630
so the way that the way that I set the tone is as a leader within the

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.420
 platoons of divisions and even departments that I've lad is one that

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.200
 is kind of is very open and fluid I enjoyed I have you know face to

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.990
 face conversations with individuals my door is always left open anyone

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.770
 that works with me understands that they can come in and talk to

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.550
 me at any time and we'll hash it out if for some reason I can't really

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.340
 give them my undivided attention at that moment all set up another

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.120
 time to do that but then we do talk it's very candid I like to try

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.910
 and break down that hierarchy structure where you know maybe they

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.690
 see me as their leader chief and they might just be the E. three I like

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.470
 to get very personal because that way the individual feels like

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.260
 they can open up more as opposed to trying to be a little stifled because

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.040
 they see this or you know the chief from your working over them

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.820
 and that's not necessarily the best way to the kind of open up that

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.610
 dialogue and then when you open up that dialogue and you begin to

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.390
 understand what makes these people take then you can kind of help develop

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.180
 and guide their path and career into the direction that it needs

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.960
 to be with with their bias
