00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.800
the relationships that I try and build with the people that I lead is

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.760
 a close one I like them to have the feel that they can approach me and

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.710
 talk to me open and honestly on whatever problems are having personally

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.670
 or professionally and so I like to kind of establish that I am

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.620
 a little more informal and the way that I do business with my support

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.580
 inside I felt that that's what helped me out throughout the eighteen

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.530
 years that I've been and throughout my career is a more informal

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.480
 approach no one thing I like to say is like no don't be formal just

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.440
 for formalities sake if it if it doesn't need to be there and it's

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.390
 just you and I in a in a personal setting then we don't need to have

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.350
 all that pomp and circumstance we're just trying to have like a heart

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.300
 to heart conversation I think that can kind of build walls and you're

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.260
 not necessarily going to get all the information that you need

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.210
 from that individual when you're having those discussions so I like

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.170
 to have a close working relationship with all the people that I work

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.120
 with whether their subordinate peer or superior
