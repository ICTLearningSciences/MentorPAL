00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.800
The relationships that I try and build with the people that I lead is

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.760
 a close one eye like them to have fuel, that they can approach me, um,

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.710
 and talk to me open and honestly on whatever problems they're having

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.670
 personally or professionally. And so I like to kind of establish

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.620
 that I am a little more informal in the way that I do business with

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.580
 my subordinates. I felt that that's helped me out throughout the 18

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.530
 years that I've been in throughout my career is amore informal approach.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.480
 One thing that I like to say is like, Don't be formal, just for

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.440
 formalities sake If it if it doesn't need to be there and it's just

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.390
 you and I in a personal setting, then we don't need to have all that

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.350
 pomp and circumstance when we're just trying to have, like, a heart

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.300
 to heart conversation. I think that kind of build walls and you're

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.260
 not necessarily going to get all the information that you need from

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.210
 that individual when you're having those discussions. So I like to

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.170
 have a close working relationship with all the people that I work with.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.120
 Whether their subordinate Pierre or superior
