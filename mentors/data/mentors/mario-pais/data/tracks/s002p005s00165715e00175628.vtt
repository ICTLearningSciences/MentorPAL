00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.330
a way to get to the root of the problem with the team member is just active

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.810
 communication you have to sit down you've got to tell them that

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.280
 you're having an issue with them show them relevant proof of you know

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.760
 what you've been noticing you know it certain even if it's kind

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.240
 of documented but on document doesn't actually have to be punitive but

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.720
 if you can you can mention like listen you know here's certain things

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.200
 that I've seen on this particular day there was this issue on this

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.680
 particular day there's was that and really show them what the kind

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.150
 of problems that you're having and then find out what's going on

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.630
 with them there might be something personal that's happened in their

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.110
 life that you're on aware of that's causing them to be unfocused and

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.590
 maybe you can find that and help them resolve those issues or there's

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.070
 something else is going on that you're on aware of that you need

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.550
 to talk to them about but the biggest thing is just that communication

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.020
 and having the strength to sit with that individual and let them

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.500
 know that there is an issue and we need to get to the bottom of it

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.980
 and figured out
