00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.330
a way to get to the root of a problem with a team member is just active

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.810
 communication. You have to sit down. You've got to tell them that

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.280
 you're having an issue with him. Show them relevant proof of you know

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.760
 what you've been noticing, you know, certain, even if it's kind of

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.240
 Ah, documented. But undocumented doesn't necessarily have to be punitive.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.720
 But if you can, you can mention like Listen, you hears certain

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.200
 things that I've seen on this particular day. There was this issue

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.680
 on this particular day. There was that and really show them what the

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.150
 kind of problems that you're having and then find out what's going

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.630
 on with them. There might be something personal that's happened in

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.110
 their life that you're unaware of. That's causing them to be unfocused.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.590
 And maybe you can find that and help them resolve those issues.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.070
 Um, or there's something else is going on that you're unaware of that

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.550
 you need to talk to them about. But the biggest thing is just that

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.020
 communication and having the strength to sit with that individual and

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.500
 let them know that there is an issue and we need to get to the bottom

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.980
 of it and figure it out
