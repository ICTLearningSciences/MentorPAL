00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.550
So, you know, if you're trying to figure out when to do a formal report

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.250
 for a possible suicide risk, your best resource to go to is gonna

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.950
 be your command suicide prevention coordinator. That individual has

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.650
 been trained and understands the resource is of window report. They

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.360
 also have points of contact at medical chaplain and Fleet family in

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.060
 order to get support for the individual who is possibly at risk. So

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.760
 go and talk with your suicide prevention coordinator and they will guide

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.460
 you through using the binder. And resource is that they have on

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.160
 when and how to make those official reports and who those reports need

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.860
 to actually go to.
