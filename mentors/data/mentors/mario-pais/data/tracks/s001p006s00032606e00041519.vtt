00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.630
So I guess what could be considered a major negative is the fact that

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.410
 you do work kind of long hours in this job and community, and there's

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.190
 nothing really defined. Some days I come in and I work till noon.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.970
 I can go home. There's other times where I don't know when I'm gonna

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.750
 be able to go home. Um, so that can kind of be looked at as a negative

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.530
 for me. I still kind of considered a bit of a positive because it

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.300
 isn't repetitive. It's something different all the time and were given

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.080
 that opportunity to kind of flex and use our own intuition on what

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.860
 we consider a work day or needs to be done. So are ours aren't that

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.640
 stringent? But it's really left up to the individual, the platoon

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.420
 and the team to decide how they're gonna work and when they wanna

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.200
 work. But we do work long hours that aren't necessarily on the schedule

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.980
 all the time.
