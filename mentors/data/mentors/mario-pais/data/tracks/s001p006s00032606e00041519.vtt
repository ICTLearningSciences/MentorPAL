00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.630
so I guess what could be considered a major negative is the fact that

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.410
 you do work kind of long hours in in this job and community and there's

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.190
 nothing really to find some days I come in and I work till noon

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.970
 I can go home there's other times where I don't know when I'm gonna

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.750
 be able to go home so that can kind of be looked at as a negative for

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.530
 me I still kind of considered a bit of a positive because it isn't

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.300
 repetitive it's something different all the time and we're given that

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.080
 opportunity to kind of flex and use our own intuition on what we

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.860
 consider a work there needs to be done so we're their hours aren't that

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.640
 stringent but it's really left up to the individual the platoon

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.420
 in the team to decide how they're going to work and when they want to

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.200
 work but we do work long hours that aren't necessarily on the schedule

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.980
 the time
