00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.630
some traits that all look for when I have new team members show up is

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.400
 is their ability to be kind of free thinkers outside the box thinkers

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.180
 innovative an adaptive those are the things that not only were looking

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.950
 for in the community but in the navy in the force as a whole we

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.730
 need more individuals to kind of think outside the box so that's the

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.500
 first thing I'm kinda looking fours is this person able to act independently

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.280
 because if they're able to act independently then that means

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.060
 it's less work that I have to be doing with them all the time and

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.830
 I can focus my efforts on other things that maybe need my attention

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.610
 as opposed to them so I'll be want to kind of the first things that

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.380
 I'm looking for and then also just their ability to fit into the team

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.160
 so not only you know do they need to be you know kind of a good

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.930
 cognizant individual but do they play well and are they they're going

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.710
 to give us a a good build for the team as well
