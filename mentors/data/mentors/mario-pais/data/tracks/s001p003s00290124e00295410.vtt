00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.630
some traits that I'll look for when I have new team members show up is

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.400
 Ah is their ability to be kind of freethinkers outside the box thinkers

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.180
 innovative and adaptive. Those are the things that not only were

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.950
 looking for in the community, but in Navy and the forces a hole. We

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.730
 need more individuals to kind of think outside the box. So that's

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.500
 the first thing that I'm kind of looking for us. Is this person able

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.280
 to act independently because if they're able to act independently,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.060
 then that means that's less work that I have to be doing with them all

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.830
 the time. And I can focus my efforts on other things that maybe need

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.610
 my attention as opposed to them. So that would be one of kind of

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.380
 the first things that I'm looking for on then also just their ability

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.160
 to fit into the team. So not only do they need to be, you know, kind

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.930
 of a good cognisant individual, but do they play well and are they

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.710
 going to give us a good build for the team as well?
