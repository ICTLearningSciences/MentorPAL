00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.660
so I feel that my priorities of changes I've progressed is a leader in

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.470
 the fact that the higher you move up in leadership with less, unless

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.280
 your priorities should be about your own self interest. You know?

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.100
 So early on when I was 34 you know? Yes, I did understand the bigger

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.910
 picture and working towards that common goal for the entire platoon,

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.720
 the command and the Navy as a whole, but also is still very concerned

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.530
 about my own personal and professional development and growth, you

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.340
 know? Can I get on this school? Can I make this trip? Can I go to

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.150
 this deployment? Can I, you know, get to this next command or get stationed

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.960
 here is very, you know, self centric, working for myself and

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.780
 the benefits of my family as you move up in leadership. And as I moved

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.590
 up in leadership, you know, you no longer are supposed to be kind

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.400
 of really worrying about yourself, But you need to really start taking

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.210
 care of the folks that you're leading and doing good by them and

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.020
 trying to progress their careers and improving their personal and

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.830
 professional development. So as you move up in your leadership role,

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.640
 you need to become more selfless than you were before and really focus

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.460
 on the folks that you're leading and making them the best that

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.270
 they can be. Because in the long run, if your people are doing well,

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.080
 the new yourself are gonna be noticed and looked upon and you're going

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.890
 to do well in the end.
