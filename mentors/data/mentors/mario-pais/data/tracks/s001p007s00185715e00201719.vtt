00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.660
so I feel that my priorities of changes I've progressed as a leader in

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.470
 the fact that the the higher you move up in leadership the less and

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.280
 less your priority should be about your own self interest you know

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.100
 so early on when I was eight three E. four yes I did understand the

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.910
 bigger picture and working towards a common goal for the entire platoon

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.720
 the command in the navy as a whole but also is still very concerned

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.530
 about my own personal professional development and growth you know

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.340
 can I get on this school can I make this trip can I go to this deployment

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.150
 can I get you know get to this next commander get station here

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.960
 is very you know self centric working for myself and and the benefits

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.780
 of my family as you move up in leadership and as I moved up in

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.590
 leadership you know you no longer are supposed to be kind of really

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.400
 worried about yourself but you need to really start taking care of

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.210
 the folks that you're leading and and then doing good by them and and

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.020
 trying to progress their careers and improving their personal and

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.830
 for and professional development so as you move up in your leadership

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.640
 role you need to become more selfless than you were before and really

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.460
 focus on the folks at your leading and and making them the best

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.270
 that they can be because in the long run if your people are doing well

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.080
 then you yourself are gonna be noticed and looked upon you're going

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.890
 to do well in the end
