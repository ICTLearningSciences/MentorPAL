00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.340
I think the best military perk that I have experienced has been the ability

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.830
 to use the Navy's tuition assistance to go to school while I'm

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.310
 in. So a CZ. Long as I've got the opportunity and the work schedule

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.800
 that allow me to take college and the Navy is willing to pay for that,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.290
 it's probably been the biggest perk. I'm close to achieving my bachelor's

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.780
 degree, and I've done all that while I've been in service

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.260
 for the last 18 years in the Navy is paid 100% of that tuition, so that's

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.750
 been like the biggest perk that I can see for me personally.
