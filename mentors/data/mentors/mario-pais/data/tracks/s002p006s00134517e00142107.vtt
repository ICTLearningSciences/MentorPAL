I think the best military perk that I've experienced has been the ability

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.830
 to use the navy's tuition assistance are to go to school while I'm

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.820
 in so you know as long as I've got the opportunity and the work schedule

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.810
 that allow me to take college in the navy is willing to pay

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.790
 for that it's probably been the biggest perk I'm close to achieving

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.780
 my bachelor's degree and I've done all that well I've been in service

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.770
 for the last eighteen years the navy's paid a hundred percent of that

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.760
 tuition so that's been like the biggest part that I can see for

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.750
 me personally
