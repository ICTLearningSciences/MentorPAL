00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.770
my recommendation. If you're trying to achieve a certain qualification,

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.690
 that eyes kind of high level is while you're going through the qualification

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.610
 process, just completely immerse yourself in that process.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.530
 Um, really understand what you're doing. Read all the references that

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.450
 are associated to that qualification. Highlight certain sections

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.370
 that you think are applicability on that you need to know and that

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.290
 you want a reference again later in the future. Take a CZ much notes

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.210
 as you can ask other people that are already qualified in that what

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.130
 made them successful on how they got qualified and immerse yourself

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.050
 in that process and make that kind of your your main focus while you're

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.970
 really trying to get that qualification.
