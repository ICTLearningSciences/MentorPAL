00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.770
my recommendation if you're trying to achieve a certain qualification

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.690
 that is kind of high level is what you're going through the qualification

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.610
 process just completely immerse yourself in that process really

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.530
 understand what you're doing read all the references that are associated

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.450
 with that qualification highlight certain sections that you think

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.370
 are applicable in that you need to know and that you want to reference

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.290
 again later in the future take as much notice as you can ask

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.210
 other people that are already qualified in that what made them successful

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.130
 and how they got qualified and immerse yourself in that process

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.050
 and make that kind of your your main focus while you're really trying

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.970
 to get that qualification
