00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.630
where I see myself in five to ten years I'm kind of undecided right now

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.410
 I'm at a point in my career where I've got eighteen years and the

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.190
 command I'm currently at can actually take me to twenty one years and

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.980
 I could essentially retire from here but because I enjoy the work

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.760
 that I'm doing so much and as long as the opportunity presents itself

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.540
 I am not opposed to re enlisting again and continue to make a career

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.320
 this and whether I do another five years or try and push out the

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.100
 thirty and retire there I'm not sure it really is going to kind of present

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.880
 itself to me in the next year to on what I decide because the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.660
 work that I've done in the navy of got a tremendous opportunities on

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.450
 the outside in the civilian sector and even in the government sector

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.230
 where I could find work and do that but I am kind of enjoy what I'm

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.010
 doing here in the security that there is with being in the navy so

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.790
 I might prolong extending as well
