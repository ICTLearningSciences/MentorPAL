00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.630
That's where I see myself in 5 to 10 years. I'm kind of undecided right

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.410
 now. I'm at a point in my career where I've got 18 years in, Um, the

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.190
 command that I'm currently at can actually take me to 21 years, and

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.980
 I could essentially retire from here, but because I enjoy the work

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.760
 that I'm doing so much, and as long as the opportunity presents itself,

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.540
 I'm not opposed to re enlisting again and continue to make a career

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.320
 of this And whether I do another five years or try and push it

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.100
 out to 30 and retire there, um, I'm not sure it really is gonna kind

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.880
 of present itself to me in the next year or two On what I decide.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.660
 Because of the work that I've done in the Navy, I've got a tremendous

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.450
 opportunities on the outside, on the civilian sector and even in the

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.230
 government sector where I could find work and do that. But I am kind

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.010
 of enjoy what I'm doing here and the security that there is with

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.790
 being in the Navy, so I might prolong and extend in as well
