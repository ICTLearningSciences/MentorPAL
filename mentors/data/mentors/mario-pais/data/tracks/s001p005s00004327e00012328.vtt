00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.300
My first major leadership role was when I became a chief petty officer

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.740
 and moved in to become the unmanned underwater vehicles leading chief

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.190
 petty officers. So I essentially was in charge of 11 other sailors.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.640
 And as we combined to create a platoon, we deployed numerous times

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.080
 to Fifth Fleet and other areas of that operation, conducting unmanned

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.530
 underwater vehicle work, looking for mines and conducting mine countermeasures.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.980
 So as the LCP oh, I was in charge of those 11 other

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.420
 sailors, personal professional development and making sure that we could

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.870
 also accomplish the mission.
