00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.190
that one easy way that I've used to identify strengths and weaknesses

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.530
 of individuals on my team is I just straight asked them when we do counseling

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.870
 sessions one on one. And it's not like punitive counseling.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.210
 This is just more sitting down and understanding where they're at

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.550
 with things and wanting to get somewhere and trying to build their personal

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.890
 and professional development. All asked him those hard questions.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.230
 Give me three strengths. Usually those are pretty easy for someone

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.570
 to answer. But then when you ask him, okay, now give me three of

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.910
 your weakness is a lot of times. That's a challenge for people on

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.250
 def. They can't give me three at that time, and they could only give

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.590
 me one. Then I say, Okay, that's all right. Get back to me when you

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.930
 have the other two. Whether that's later that day, later that week,

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.270
 you know what have you Because that really makes them kind of look

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.610
 inside and get a little more insightful on themselves. And then once

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.950
 you've identified those strengths and weaknesses, then you as the leader,

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.290
 can help, you know, build up those weaknesses into strengths

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.630
 and the strength that they have continued to improve those and not lose

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.970
 them as strengths.
