00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.390
at one easy way that I've used to identify strengths and weaknesses of

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.920
 individuals on my team is I just straight ask them when we do counseling

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.460
 sessions one on one and it's not like punitive counseling this

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.000
 is just more sitting down in understanding where they're at with things

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.530
 I wanted to get somewhere and you know trying to build their personal

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.070
 and professional development all ask them those hard questions

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.610
 give me three strings and usually those are pretty easy for someone

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.140
 to answer but then when you ask okay no give me three of your weaknesses

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.680
 a lot of times that's a challenge for people and if they can't

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.210
 give me three at that time and they can only give me one then I say

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.750
 okay that's all right now get back to me when you have the other two

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.290
 whether that's later that day later that week you know what have

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.820
 you because that really make some kind of look inside and get a little

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.360
 more insight flung themselves and once you've identified those strengths

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.900
 and weaknesses and you as the leader can help you know build

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.430
 up those weaknesses into strength and the strings that they have continued

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.970
 to improve those and not lose them as strengths
