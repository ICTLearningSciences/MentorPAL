00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.210
the way that I would handle a sailor who's become less effective due to

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.560
 loss or grief is first of all understand where they're at in their

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.920
 grieving process you know that process is different from not for everybody

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.280
 some people are able to just continue on like nothing's happened

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.630
 where it takes other people little bit longer to grieve and you

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.990
 need to understand that you need to be accommodating for that but also

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.350
 not so accommodating that is detrimental to your mission objectives

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.710
 so you're gonna have to come to work with that individual and really

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.060
 find out if they are getting the support that they need what do

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.420
 they need to do to get to the next step in their grieving process but

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.780
 don't feel like you don't ever try and Russia feel like you need

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.130
 to rush that individual either because that's not your responsibilities

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.490
 to rush them through the grieving process is need to understand

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.850
 where they're at and how to get them the right support and make sure

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.200
 that it's keeps them on track and it's not causing issues with mission

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.560
 objectives
