00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.210
the way that I would handle a sailor who's become less effective due to

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.560
 loss or grief is first of all, understand where they're at in their

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.920
 grieving process. You know, that process is different from for everybody.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.280
 Some people are able to just continue on like nothing's happened,

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.630
 where it takes other people a little bit longer to grieve, and

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.990
 you need to understand that you need to be accommodating for that,

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.350
 but also not so accommodating that is detrimental to your mission objectives.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.710
 So you're gonna have to kind of work with that individual

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.060
 and really find out if they are getting the support that they need.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.420
 What do they need to do to get to the next step in their grieving process?

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.780
 But don't feel like you don't ever try and rush or feel like

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.130
 You need to rush that individual either, because that's not your responsibilities

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.490
 to rush them through the grieving process. I just need

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.850
 to understand where they're at and how to get them the right support

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.200
 and make sure that it's keeps them on track, and it's not causing

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.560
 issues with mission objectives
