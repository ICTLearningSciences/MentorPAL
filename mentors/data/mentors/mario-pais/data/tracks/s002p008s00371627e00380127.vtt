where do you can drink alcohol if you're deployed really depends on where

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.350
 you're deployed to some regions that you're gonna go to it's a dry

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.100
 area it's a dry region and you're probably not gonna be able to have

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.850
 alcohol there or if you do have any you're gonna find it on on base

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.600
 right and and the sea and that's the only place that you can drink

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.350
 it because you're not able to bring it out of town just because of

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.100
 that particular areas cultural you know norms rules and laws other

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.850
 places that you're gonna be on deployment you more than likely will

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.600
 be able to partake in and drinking alcohol so rich really depends on

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.350
 where you're going the best thing to do is just ask around two people

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.100
 have been deployed to that area before if alcohol was available

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.850
 or not and if it's something you'd be able to part
