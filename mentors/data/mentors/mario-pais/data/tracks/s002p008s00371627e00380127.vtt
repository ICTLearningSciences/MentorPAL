Whether you can drink alcohol if you're deployed really depends on where

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.770
 you're deployed to some regions that you're going to go to. It's

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.230
 a dry area. It's a dry region, and you're probably not gonna be ableto

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.700
 have alcohol there. Or if you do have any, you're gonna find it on

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.160
 on base or at an embassy. And that's the only place that you can drink

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.620
 it because you're not able to bring it out in town. Just because

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.080
 of that particular areas, cultural norms, rules and laws, other places

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.540
 that you're gonna be on deployment, you more than likely we'll

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.000
 be able to partake in drinking alcohol. So we're just really depends

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.470
 on where you're going. The best thing to do is just ask around two

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.930
 people that have been deployed to that area before. If alcohol was available

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.390
 or not, and if it's something you're gonna be able to part
