00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.850
ways that you can build trust between your team members is by trying to

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.850
 do team events that make every individual rely on each other and as

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.850
 the team as a whole so trying to come up with you know different ideas

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.850
 solutions exercises go out and do team events to build that camaraderie

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 that unit cohesion between your team you know not everyone

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.850
 is always going to get along with everyone that they work with within

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.850
 their team our platoon or department but they need to know that when

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.850
 it's it's time for work it's time for mission that they all can trust

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.850
 one another the best way to do that is through some unit cohesion

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 building you know examples or exercises and a lot of times adversity

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.850
 really build that trust as well when you can put a team through

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.850
 something that is that everyone had to deal with which was a very stressful

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.850
 situation people come out of that with the same kind of mutual

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.850
 understanding because they all experience that same stressful situation

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 and that's going to build some trust amongst your team members

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.850
 of the team as a whole
