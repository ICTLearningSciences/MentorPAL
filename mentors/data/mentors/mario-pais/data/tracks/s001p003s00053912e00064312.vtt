00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.850
ways that you can build trust between your team members is by trying to

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.850
 do team events that make every individual rely on each other and as

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.850
 the team as a whole. So try and come up with, you know, different

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.850
 ideas, solutions, exercises, go out and do team events to build that

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 camaraderie, that unit cohesion between your team. Not everyone's always

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.850
 gonna get along with everyone that they work with within their

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.850
 team or platoon or department, But they need to know that when it's

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.850
 it's time for work, it's time for mission that they all can trust one

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.850
 another. And the best way to do that is through some unit cohesion

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 building, you know, examples or exercises. And a lot of times adversity

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.850
 really builds that trust is well, and you can put a team through

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.850
 something that is that everyone had to deal with, which was a very

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.850
 stressful situation. People come out of that with the same kind of

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.850
 mutual understanding because they all experienced that same stressful

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 situation, and that's gonna build some trust amongst your team members

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.850
 in the team as a whole
