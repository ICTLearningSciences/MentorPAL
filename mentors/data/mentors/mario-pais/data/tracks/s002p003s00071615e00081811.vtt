00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.290
if you have trouble listening. Well, some strategies that you can do is

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.730
 get out of your own head. Um, you effective communication? There's

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.180
 a difference between a conversation and communication. No communication

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.620
 is being able to actually sit and listen to what the other person

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.060
 is saying without being in your own head, trying to figure out what

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.500
 you're going to say next. Because then you're gonna miss certain

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.950
 things that that person is telling you. So one step did you can do is

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.390
 if you find yourself when somebody is talking that you're in your

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.830
 own head, trying to figure out how you're going to continue to keep

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.270
 the conversation going or what you're gonna try and say next, Just stop.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.710
 Stop, try and clear your mind and listen to what the person saying

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.160
 it also just be honest. A lot of times one waiting to get past your

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.600
 own personal flaws is to let other people know that you have those

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.040
 flaws and you can tell that individual you know what? I'm sorry.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.480
 I was half listening to what you're saying. If you wouldn't mind, could

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.930
 you please repeat it so that I can I can hear you a little bit better

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.370
 and we can continue this conversation in this communication in

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.810
 a better light
