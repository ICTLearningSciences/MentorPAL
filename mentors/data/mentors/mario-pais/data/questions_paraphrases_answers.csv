,,mario-pais,Describe your ideal team.,my ideal team is a group of individuals that are able to think on their own that are creative innovative able to adapt but then are able to also come together to accomplish a major goal use it's good to always have people that have their own individual ideas within a team because you can always find out new interesting ways to approach a problem and come to a new solution as opposed to everyone that has that group think mentality so you know that's my ideal team is is everyone that can think individually but be working towards that common group goal 
,,mario-pais,What things do you always make sure to lead by example on?,one thing that I try and lead by example on is work ethic I think you you know if you can show that you're putting forth an effort than the people that you're leading you're gonna want to do that as well as general reciprocity of of showing you know a particular behavior of people wanting to mimic that there's nothing that I will ask anyone that I'm leading to do that I myself have not already done before or willing to do so that's kind of the mentality that you need to have when you're when you're leading folks and and looking to get those examples 
,,mario-pais,What are some tips to earn the trust of my team?,some tips to earn the trust your team is just building that communication layer between you and them and opening up that dialogue they they shouldn't be able or they should be afraid to come to you to ask questions whether that's you know you have an open door policy or there's a particular time that they know they can come to talk to you when they do do that your intently listening and your building that open dialogue and communication which in turn is going to improve and build their trust with you as their leader 
,,mario-pais,How do you connect more deeply with your team members?,one way that you can connect more deeply with your team members is getting to know them you know on a personal level besides just professional so you know if you know what kind of moats them professionally that's great you can help drive drive their career in that path but then if you kind of know what they're into personally that's can allow you to build those kind of connections that ought to allow them to open up to you when you communicate build those kind of trust relationships because you know about their family and their wife or husband or significant other or their kids or their dog or where they grew up with there even just her first name is how when they graduate high school did they graduate high school all these different kind of things I don't necessarily see that as intrusive leadership if you do it in the right way you're not really necessarily being intrusive you're just getting to know your people which in turn is going to build communication and build trust 
,,mario-pais,"How do I build trust between different team members (e.g., new ones, ones with bad interactions)?",ways that you can build trust between your team members is by trying to do team events that make every individual rely on each other and as the team as a whole so trying to come up with you know different ideas solutions exercises go out and do team events to build that camaraderie that unit cohesion between your team you know not everyone is always going to get along with everyone that they work with within their team our platoon or department but they need to know that when it's it's time for work it's time for mission that they all can trust one another the best way to do that is through some unit cohesion building you know examples or exercises and a lot of times adversity really build that trust as well when you can put a team through something that is that everyone had to deal with which was a very stressful situation people come out of that with the same kind of mutual understanding because they all experience that same stressful situation and that's going to build some trust amongst your team members of the team as a whole 
,,mario-pais,What are good strategies to have the right kind of presence with my team?,so a couple of good strategies to have the right presents for your team the few examples right I think for me which works best is being approachable being able to relate setting an example and not sweating the small stuff you know because that can easily get in the way of the bigger goal a bigger mission so if you're able to be approachable kind of you know set that example as well as not sweating the small stuff then folks are going to kind of look at you and and want to be able to come to you and ask you for help and know that what you're giving them is is honest feedback and that you know what you're giving them is honesty 
,,mario-pais,How do you and your work colleagues socialize outside of work?,some ways that my work colleagues and I socialize after work are either doing you know events where we can bring all of our families to like picnics things like that for example whenever we would go before we go out on the plane that we usually have some sort of family day for everybody within the platoon we'll do it on a weekend we'll do it somewhere whether it's at the beach or at a park or at some other kind of venue where all the families can get together it was significant others kids all that kind of mingling meet discuss and and kind of build that camaraderie not only as the platoon in the group but also too is the supporting family members that might have to come to support one another while we're away as well as support us while we're gone you know on deployment 
,,mario-pais,How should your relationship be with your subordinates ? (close vs. far),the relationships that I try and build with the people that I lead is a close one I like them to have the feel that they can approach me and talk to me open and honestly on whatever problems are having personally or professionally and so I like to kind of establish that I am a little more informal and the way that I do business with my support inside I felt that that's what helped me out throughout the eighteen years that I've been and throughout my career is a more informal approach no one thing I like to say is like no don't be formal just for formalities sake if it if it doesn't need to be there and it's just you and I in a in a personal setting then we don't need to have all that pomp and circumstance we're just trying to have like a heart to heart conversation I think that can kind of build walls and you're not necessarily going to get all the information that you need from that individual when you're having those discussions so I like to have a close working relationship with all the people that I work with whether their subordinate peer or superior 
,,mario-pais,"How do I help my team prepare for a tough mission (e.g., inspection, long mission)?",ways that you can help your team prepare for an upcoming tough mission first and foremost is obviously training and you have to have that foresight ahead of time to know that should be of particular mission coming down the line and then training to that and stressing them as much as you possibly can in that training environment to prepare them for that tough mission ahead so that way the first time that they're experiencing some of that toughness you know isn't during when that mission is happening but they will actually already experienced that during training set situations and scenarios because that's where you can apply fixes when you start noticing some of those deficiencies and building that mental tenacity and when that mental to nasty is built then you also start to see that physical capacity come out and they'll be ready for those tough mission so training ahead of time and and training and stressful environment that's going to get you prepared for those tough missions 
,,mario-pais,What kinds of people will I work with? Personalitites,depending upon where you go in where you're working you're gonna always deal with different types of personalities Taipei's all the way down right you know if you're working in more of a specialized community you're gonna find a lot more type B. personalities people that do not want to fail that are driven to success driven to win another place that you're gonna work sometimes people are content with mediocrity and only doing what needs to be done to go home for the day you've got to understand what drives people what their influences are and then work with them at their level it's gonna be very challenging to try and turn somebody from one personality type to another so you have to kind of work with where they're at and understand those types and find out what their strengths and weaknesses are and build them up and then as long as you move towards a common goal 
,,mario-pais,What kinds of people respond better to certain leadership strategies?,depending upon the type of people that you're leading you're gonna have to obviously have different leadership styles some you might have to be a little more intrusive on and provide a lot more detail maybe a little more hand holding then you'd like to do until they come to catch on and understand what it is you want then there's gonna be other folks that you just have to tell him one type of thing and they're off and running and they're gonna get it all done and come back to you with a product and you know it's exactly what you're looking for so you have to kind of understand those different types of people and work towards that in your leadership style to address those those concerns main goal is to trying to always improve people where they're at and making sure that you're using the right leadership style for the right person don't be too micro management might have to start that off in the beginning with a certain person but then eventually allow that you'll let the leash out let them get that responsibility and and build up their self esteem and their ability to take charge and there and continue to work for you do great things 
,,mario-pais,When is it a good idea to share personal stories or emotions with members of your team?,that's that's really kind of a situational type question on wind to share personal stories or motions with your team I think it is dependent on what's going on the situation at hand the environment that you're in lot of times it makes sense to share very personal stories because then people can relate to a little bit more they understand that you're very similar to them you might even have a very similar story that they have which creates that relationship and build that trust and communication and then other times depend upon the situation or where you're at you might not want to share personal stories or show very much emotion so it's really something that you just kinda have to to gauge where you're at in the environment that you're in and the people that you're working with when's the right time to be emotional when's the right time to be a little more formal on those kind of things 
,,mario-pais,What counseling skills are important?,so some counseling skills that I've used that of help me out throughout my career made a lot of what I learned when I was on recruiting duty because you're basically meeting people for the first time and having to you know convince them that join the navy is in their best interest it's an intangible product in your sensually selling it to them it's not something they can take home they have to believe in what you're saying and believe in you and so that kinda help me out with building so my counselor skills and so I've found that you know being able to listen and and you know listen well and kind of ask probing questions to get behind that need or get behind you know what that surface value is because there's always something underlying there that's something you want to try and get to and what you can do that is through listening well and then asking questions that kind of will listed you know open ended core responses to your questions that you ask 
,,mario-pais,How do I push my team to meet the standards? (if they are having trouble meeting them),having if your team is having trouble meeting standards and you need to trying to get them there I mean there's different things you can do when the first things that I recommend is you know taking a pause taking a step back and reassess what's going on is there something that you're missing as a leader that maybe isn't necessarily coming down to their level to help them make that mission achievement is there something going on personally in their life that you're not aware of that has them you know not fully engage with their at work to make that mission accomplishment might find that after you talk with them that there is something going on personal and they're unable to focus and so that was the issue and so you can try and help them resolve that issue or get them to the people that can help them resolve that in that way it'll help hopefully bring them back online and get them focused again if you've kind of tried all that and you're you're basically at your wits and you really don't know what to do obviously need to communicate that on up and say listen here the steps that I've taken to try and help my team make this mission successful or meet mission objectives and we're just missing it tried ABCD any and we were you know here's what we've done here's the relevant proof that we're making the best attempt it's just it's not achievable based on the situation that we have or the equipment or even the people that I have were unable to make that you have to communicate that up and communicated up early so that way set certain things to be put in line to maybe help bring that team or maybe they re assess what they're asking you to do and and realize that that actually is unachievable and where it's a big ask and nobody looked at it that way and now that you've tried everything and you've put out several you know courses of action and you've tried all those and are not working maybe we need to re assess what's going on so you might find that's helpful if it is achievable and you've just tried everything then the next piece is maybe you start to do a little bit of a counseling session with if it a particular individual and you've tried everything you might have to do some counseling with them 
,,mario-pais,How should you reward your sailors for good performance?,there are so many different ways in the navy that you can reward your sailors for good performance when you first have to do is just figure out what motivates your people you know because what motivates one person is gonna be different from somebody else if I've got somebody who's been performing really well and I know that they enjoy time off then that might be what I reward them with his an extra day off we're going home early or something like that if I got another individual who doesn't really care about time off because they're really driven and just like to work and perform up maybe I actually given more responsibility because that's what they're been seeking they want to show that they're capable of taking on more so I give them that might have other individuals that are really you know looking for that kind of a ward or credit or something so put him in for the award so you you have to really just understand what drives a motive each each one of those individuals and then you know work towards that whenever they're doing good things but always let your people know when they're doing something good you know even just that that subtle it in the middle of the day Hey really doing you know I appreciate what you're doing or that looks great even just that single comment when they've been working hard like that looks great are you really doing well there that might be enough to continue to push them on to finish that evolution 
,,mario-pais,"What traits and experience, do you look for when interviewing new team members?",some traits that all look for when I have new team members show up is is their ability to be kind of free thinkers outside the box thinkers innovative an adaptive those are the things that not only were looking for in the community but in the navy in the force as a whole we need more individuals to kind of think outside the box so that's the first thing I'm kinda looking fours is this person able to act independently because if they're able to act independently then that means it's less work that I have to be doing with them all the time and I can focus my efforts on other things that maybe need my attention as opposed to them so I'll be want to kind of the first things that I'm looking for and then also just their ability to fit into the team so not only you know do they need to be you know kind of a good cognizant individual but do they play well and are they they're going to give us a a good build for the team as well 
,,mario-pais,How should your relationship with you're the people in charge of you ?,the relationship that you have with the people that are in charge of you in my opinion needs to be kind of open and honest they need to know what your expectations are of them and you definitely need to know what their expectations are of you and if your meeting those so it's it's okay to occasionally get with them and ask Hey you know my meeting your expectations of my meeting the commands objective a mission objectives are we heading in the right direction and constantly reassess those things because the situation is changing those objectives change all the time but you want to have an open honest relationship with your superiors so that way they they that trust is built and they take what you say as as truth and they're not gonna die out kind of the information that you're putting out 
,,mario-pais,What would you advise a person in this field to get to know their bosses?,one way that's helped me to understand my my boss my superiors is to find a time to sit down with them and and go over what their expectations are and where we fit into the overall commands mission objectives lot of times as best done over lunch and sometimes I'll be the one to initiate that office all set up a time asking Hey would be good if if you and I can get together over lunch at such and such date and times that we can discuss you know where we're going with this department or division where you want to lead it and what our expectations are of one another and and that kind of takes you out of of of formal setting and put you in a more informal one where people have a tendency to open up and be a little more communicated and I've found that that's kind of work the best for me 
,,mario-pais,What encourages accountability?,I think we can encourage accountability is making sure that everyone that's working on that team knows that their their work is valued their opinions are valued and that the work that they're doing has merit if you have that buy in from everyone on the team and they're working together as a team people are gonna have a tendency to not only be accountable for themselves but they're gonna hold others accountable as well because they don't want the team more and or the mission to fail and the way you do that is by establishing that value in the work that they're doing as an individual and as a team as a whole 
,,mario-pais,What are ways you can identify the strengths and limitations for each member of your team?,at one easy way that I've used to identify strengths and weaknesses of individuals on my team is I just straight ask them when we do counseling sessions one on one and it's not like punitive counseling this is just more sitting down in understanding where they're at with things I wanted to get somewhere and you know trying to build their personal and professional development all ask them those hard questions give me three strings and usually those are pretty easy for someone to answer but then when you ask okay no give me three of your weaknesses a lot of times that's a challenge for people and if they can't give me three at that time and they can only give me one then I say okay that's all right now get back to me when you have the other two whether that's later that day later that week you know what have you because that really make some kind of look inside and get a little more insight flung themselves and once you've identified those strengths and weaknesses and you as the leader can help you know build up those weaknesses into strength and the strings that they have continued to improve those and not lose them as strengths 
,,mario-pais,How does one develop one's interpersonal communcation skills to work better with a team?,one way that you can develop your your interpersonal skills working with the team be a better team mate is is improving your your level of communication not just how you are able to get your response is a cross but also just listening to others and you know you really have to to listen to a lot of times people when they're being talked to they're in their own minds kind of thinking what they already want to say to that question or with their response is going to be and when you do that you really aren't fully listening to what the other person is saying because you're more inside your own head trying to kind of figure out what you're going to say next and you can miss a lot so one of things you can do with your interpersonal communication skills is just truly listen like don't be in your own head trying to figure out what you're going to say next but listen to what's being said if you have to take a moment to pause and then start thinking that's okay because then you fully listen to what those other teammates had to say you're gonna provide a much better response to that question or the overall conversation which is going to propel that team in a in a forward direction 
,,mario-pais,How is it different to manage military people vs. civilians in the military?,so you're gonna have some challenges when it comes to your leadership styles between military and civilian or even contractors are government employees no military a lot of times it's very cut and dry what you you can do with them in your leadership styles how you can award them and reward them as well as what you can do with them putatively when you start dealing with civilians or certain lines that you just can't cross that you might have to understand what their actual statement of work is and where they're lateral lines and limits are because what you think you could ask a military person to do they'll be able to do but a particular civilian whether government employer contractor is pretty much limited to what statement of work says that they can do I if you start asking them to do things out of that scope you can get them in trouble you can get yourself in trouble so you really got to understand you know what their limits are and then work around that and understand that you can't necessarily hold them to the same punitive standard as you could a military member but they also do have their avenues to where let's say you do have a civilian employee is not meeting the standards becoming difficult obviously you can't discipline them yourself you might have to go directly to their supervisor or the the the contract supervisor whoever their program manager is and begin to have that dialogue and say you're having difficulties with the civilian employee and what are the next steps you can do to rectify the situation 
,,mario-pais,What makes the navy different than other branches of the military?,I think something that kind of makes the did navy different than other branches is is the uniqueness of some of the job skills that we have and that you'll find there's a lot of different ratings within the navy that have a tendency to be a Jack of all trades you know they have a particular job skill that they were trained to do but as they move from one community to the next or duty station a duty station their roles and responsibilities their technical skills those kind of things improve and and kind of start trickling out and growing tentacles and you start realizing that okay not only do I need to be good at this but I also have to be good at that and you're gonna get train and learn how to do that so I think that's something unique to the navy is the fact that the flexibility in the jobs that you do as well as the adaptive nature and and the asked to be able to do sometimes more than what you were initially trained to do so you have those opportunities to kind of do a variety of different things 
,,mario-pais,What are some common misconceptions about your field?,so at some common misconception about my field or or let's say more in general terms leadership positions let's go that route is that the leader is expected to know everything and that's not necessarily true right the leaders we put our pants on the same as everybody else there's no mystery here we just might have a little bit more experience and time doing something so doesn't necessarily mean that we know all the answers to everything however as the leader should be able to try and find those answers so you might you might not necessarily know right off the bat what the answer is to particular question what you should at least know what resources you can go to to find out whether that's utilizing your peers within say the chiefs master the wardroom or if you're an LP using your peers that are in the UFC P. O. a or the other folks that you work with to find those answers when you're in that leadership position but don't have that misconception that I'm a leader I must know everything I must be able to answer everything right off the bat that's not the case you can take some time to get to an answer if need be make sure that you do it right 
,,mario-pais,What is a uuv?,you you V. stands for unmanned underwater vehicle and essentially it's it's a robot an underwater robot that can be used to do a variety of things under the water summer programmed with side scan sonar to survey a bottom area looking for anything from mines to ship racks sunken aircraft you anything that's been lost under the water to collecting environmental information like bathymetry or temperature salinity or all the other kind of environmental factors that are under the ocean surface there it's a it's you program it so doesn't necessarily need to have somebody operating it entirely it's not tethered you since the program the vehicle you can send it out on its way it runs this pre programmed mission then you recover it you can download the data and then interpret that data depend upon what sensors you had attached to the vehicle what your overall mission requirements are 
,,mario-pais,What  does your uuv program train?,the U. V. training that we do here is to prepare you you the platoon's for deployment into theaters across the globe ready to do major combat operations based on what the command combatant commander's intent is so we're gonna train this entire platoon to be able to operate in small units in austere environments in all kinds of weather the working off a small craft using small vehicles and things of that nature in order to accomplish the over arching mission of you finding detecting neutralizing and exploiting underwater mines and basically anything else it's under the water that needs to be founder survey searched that's what we're training to 
,,mario-pais,How are you preparing for your next promotion?,the way that I'm preparing for my next promotion is by understanding you know what is the navy actually looking for for the individuals that they intend to promote to the next pay grade so every year the certain documents are published for those that are moving up in rank whether you're going from east six to the chief and chief to senior chief senior chief to pass chief petty officer there's documents that are posed to say this is what the navy is looking for on individuals that are not only meeting goals but also exceeding those and so my goal is if I want to get promoted the next rank is to understand where the navy is heading what it wants to do by reading those documents to making sure that I'm a lining the work that I'm doing today that's gonna give me my best opportunity to promote 
,,mario-pais,What is an EOD?,U. D. stands for explosive ordinance disposal at saw one of those community is kind of in the special operations community of the navy where individuals are trained to dispose of exploit OR neutralized hazards whether it's mines to nuclear weapons it can be anything in the air surface for under the water U. D. personnel are trained to be able to get to that feeder that environment and detecting neutralize those hazards 
,,mario-pais,What was your first major leadership role?,my first major leadership role was when I became a chief petty officer and moved in to become the unmanned underwater vehicles leading chief petty officer so I sensually was in charge of eleven other sailors and as we combine to create a platoon we deployed numerous times to fifth fleet in other areas of that operation conducting on man underwater vehicle work looking for mines in conducting mine countermeasures so as they'll see PO I was you know in charge of those eleven other sailors personal professional development and making sure that we can also accomplish the mission 
,,mario-pais,How do you spend most of your time at work?,currently I spend most of my time at work developing curriculum as well as administering that to UMass platoons that are coming through the training unit here so that can be anywhere from you know eight personnel up to twenty four personnel and I lead a division of ten other instructors so that we can provide this curriculum and training to these platoons that are getting ready to deploy all over the world to do major combat operations 
,,mario-pais,Describe the physical environments in which you've worked.,I've worked in a variety of different physical environments everywhere from just the office work space out into austere environments where we've been out at three in the morning off to the coast of acts you know alone and unafraid in a small boat while it was raining and foggy and you name it so a variety of different working environments based on the jobs that I've done over my career 
,,mario-pais,How many hours do you work in a typical week?,so my typical week that my hours vary and that's because the program that we're standing up and creating is very fluid and what kind of building it off the ground another way of saying is we're we're building this plane while we're flying at the same time so usually my work weeks can consist of working from eight in the morning til sometimes ten at night I do take my work home with me a lot of time so if I'm here training personnel from early in the morning till you know for five o'clock in the afternoon there stuff I still need to get accomplished all take that home and work on it so on an average you know I'm I'm working on anywhere between ten and twelve hours a day at a minimum 
,,mario-pais,What kinds of decisions do you make in your career on a daily basis?,so the decisions that I make on a daily basis can very based on the situation at hand right so for example as the L. C. P. O. of the U. M. S. division there's times I have to deal with the sailors personal and professional development for example a sailor might come in and say that he have it he's having family issues or needs to get his wife's car registered how to go about doing that so I got to help him out with that it piece of work then other times I might be getting tasking from our Commodore even our admiral it Thaicom that's wanting to see where we're moving for with developing certain programs for the E. U. D. community especially the X. M. C. M. communion mine countermeasures so it varies from some of the very small minute personal face to face things all the way up to higher level examples working with Commodores and had admirals across the force 
,,mario-pais,What kinds of problems do you deal with?,so I do with all kinds of problems that very and and level of complexity some can be just my computer just doesn't seem to want to work for the day or my email is not seeming to work which can create frustration all the way up to logistical problems and requirements that we need to get X. amount of people ready to deploy within a moment's notice and I need to have X. amount of gear and equipment and flight scheduled going from one place to the other and needing to coordinate that so you know the problems can vary from something very small up to something very big which could impact operations in theater 
,,mario-pais,What is a story that really shows what it is like working in your job?,so one story that I can think of that really shows what its like working on my job is is a story that kind of has to do with innovation and outside the box thinking which we commonly have to do in the E. O. D. community here one of which was we had a particular piece of gear one of our you you vis which is about twelve feet in length and weighs about six hundred pounds and it's really been tied to launching recovering from an eleven meter read and these eleven meter ribs you can only move them in theater from one place to another based on particular err strategically for choir miss that are there it's very difficult to kind of get aircraft that you can fit an eleven meter ribbons side so we thought outside the box and figured how can we move this piece of equipment using the most smallest platform that we have in our arsenal which is a very small combat rubber rating crafter creek so this was out on deployment and we found kind of a construction site that had some left over plywood and foam and we basically developed a sled device that we were able to pull this vehicle up on two in tow behind our smallest platformer smallest creek that had just a thirty five horsepower engine and still be able to be combat effective and deploy the equipment searching for mines all across the theater so from that are admiral happened actually see what we have developed out of wood and phone Khan and got nicknamed the spruce goose and later he actually funded a program to develop a more robust proto type and here we are five years later we actually have eighteen of these operational prototypes being worked right now they've gone through several different iterations and there now part of the X. MCM companies tower table of allowances and they deploy with these things that provide us an opportunity to basically get to where we need to without being strong arm to using the eleven meter crew of red 
,,mario-pais,What are the major benefits of doing this kind of work?,so one of the major benefits my job what I think is great about it is just the diversity that you experience every single day it's really not the same thing every single day you're given many opportunities to kind of think on your own and be responsible even our most junior personality very early start in their career are given tremendous responsibility where that's leading personnel or the responsible for multi million dollars worth of equipment I don't think you can really find that and many other places not even within the navy at some points as well as in the civilian world I mean what civilian job do you know is going to give an eighteen year old the ability to make you know critical decisions as well as be in charge of millions of dollars worth of gear that is gonna potentially cause impact or threat to not only friendly forces but to our enemy forces so that's kind of one of the biggest benefits of working in this community is the fact that you are really given a lot of freedom in the way and looked at as an intellectual adult who's able to make decisions and and moved the ball forward for progressing the force in the community 
,,mario-pais,What are the major negatives of doing this kind of work?,so I guess what could be considered a major negative is the fact that you do work kind of long hours in in this job and community and there's nothing really to find some days I come in and I work till noon I can go home there's other times where I don't know when I'm gonna be able to go home so that can kind of be looked at as a negative for me I still kind of considered a bit of a positive because it isn't repetitive it's something different all the time and we're given that opportunity to kind of flex and use our own intuition on what we consider a work there needs to be done so we're their hours aren't that stringent but it's really left up to the individual the platoon in the team to decide how they're going to work and when they want to work but we do work long hours that aren't necessarily on the schedule the time 
,,mario-pais,How much travel do you do in a year?,so I end up doing a lot of travel is in this community even whether you're you're considered shore duty or sea duty your costly traveling perfect example I just got back from Guam this week the week of the month before that I was in Florida the month before that I was in Washington so I'm constantly traveling whether it's conus or conus and I'm in I'm in shore duty right now I'm an instructor so even on our sea duty when you're actually operating your traveling as well you're making six seven month deployments you're traveling for exercises conus and conus as well so we travel a lot and for me that's that's kind of a positive I enjoy travelling and seeing the world it's one of the reasons why I joined the navy in the first place 
,,mario-pais,Why do you love your job?,so one of the main reasons why I love my job is the fact that it's kind of an unconventional a job in the navy with what we're doing with a man under water vehicles in the mine countermeasures role we're given a lot of flexibility were given the ability to be innovative and creative think outside the box and adapt to certain challenges that come to us and I like that aspect of the of working in this community is the fact that it's not always the same thing every day and they really they really like to see individuals that can that can think on their own and create these kind of innovative solutions to the tasks at hand 
,,mario-pais,What gets romanticized about your career field that really isn't that great?,I think a lot of times gets romanticizes that were constantly out there doing you know dangerous or hazardous work and so a lot of times people are given creditor kudos for things that they might not necessarily do all the time on a daily basis and so you know not everybody in the navy and not everybody even in this community is a is an operator shooter is going down range you know creating havoc to the faux face to face you know there are other people out there that are that are doing a lot of good work in the logistical side the supporting side there also considered enablers that allow those real special operators to go and do their work but you know those enablers don't necessarily get the credit that there do or they get looked at in appropriately and you're in that community so you must do this when necessarily they don't so I think that might be something that gets romanticized a lot about but a lot of people don't really understand what goes behind making good operations work and it's those people that do that 
,,mario-pais,What do you do now that is different from what you thought you would be doing?,so what I do now that's different than what I thought I was going to be doing is not originally joined the navy to come in to be a navy seal and during that time you actually had to pick a source rating before you can go on to seal training so I asked the the detailer that was there at maps you know what's the short is a school you have because I have no intention on doing it and he said Hey all maintenance technician so I asked what's that it's welding okay yeah I give it to me I'll do that short school so went through boot camp when on my following a school for whole maintenance technician and welding and then went on to bud's where I didn't make it all the way through the program so I ended up having to become a whole means technician where I ended up actually moving on to io de is my first command in doing marine mammal handling and working in that aspect and because of the job that I had done initially with the EOD I've actually been managed to maintain an entire career within this community and never really have actually worked within the whole maintenance tech job so you know originally came in to be a CEO and then all maintenance technician as a secondary platform and now here I am a senior chief in the navy that actually uses on man underwater vehicles to do mine countermeasures for the navy as a whole 
,,mario-pais,How did your work day change over your career?,so my work days change over my career as I've progressed and leadership obviously when I was a junior person in my work day was really kind of delegated out to me by my PO and my chief at the time and so I knew kind of what I had to do for the day and what my set hours work as I progressed in my leadership and throughout my career you know now my work day seems like it never ends to be honest because I have a lot more responsibilities that I need to look at and and and conduct I bought other people's careers that I'm also responsible for as well as maintaining the program that we work in and moving that forward so I would say that my work day and workload has increased as I progressed in my career but that's expected and that's something that you should you intend on scene as you move up in leadership and throughout your career 
,,mario-pais,"Where did you have to move in your career, and how did that change things each time?",so within my career I've had to move several times and it didn't Kerr some changes for that personally with my family and and those kind of things I've had to move from the west coast to the east coast back to the west coast again when I've made deployment some actually going out of country for you know six to seven months at a time and that that kind of takes a toll on you personally as well as what do you have to deal with with your family so I've been able to you know move my family to live back home with family and friends there's a support unit when I've been on deployments and then of course moving back and forth from coast to coast I have a tendency to where I will go out first he kind of establish that residency and get all of our household goods moved in and everything set up before I finally move my wife and kids out to to live in that home so it's some more easier transition for them to do and I kind of take on all the the heavy lifting in that aspect 
,,mario-pais,Where do you see yourself in 5 years? 10?,where I see myself in five to ten years I'm kind of undecided right now I'm at a point in my career where I've got eighteen years and the command I'm currently at can actually take me to twenty one years and I could essentially retire from here but because I enjoy the work that I'm doing so much and as long as the opportunity presents itself I am not opposed to re enlisting again and continue to make a career this and whether I do another five years or try and push out the thirty and retire there I'm not sure it really is going to kind of present itself to me in the next year to on what I decide because the work that I've done in the navy of got a tremendous opportunities on the outside in the civilian sector and even in the government sector where I could find work and do that but I am kind of enjoy what I'm doing here in the security that there is with being in the navy so I might prolong extending as well 
,,mario-pais,What makes a good leader?,so what I think makes a good leader is somebody who is also a good listener in order for you to lead your people effectively also have to be able to understand and listen to what your people's needs are and understand what mission requirements are you you can't just automatically jump in immediately trying take hold of something and and leave from the get go or else you're not gonna get any buy in from the personnel that you're trying to lead so it's best to get together with them first and kind of understand what their challenges are what their strengths are and then build from that and then not allow you to lead that entire group for such always making a positive impact for the command in the navy as a whole 
,,mario-pais,What are the most important first steps in a new leadership position?,so I think the first steps that when you have a new leadership position is obviously getting to understand your people first and and understanding what their strengths and weaknesses are and how you can use those to progress not only their personal and professional development for but the group as a whole as long as the group is moving forward and that in turn is going to allow the commands mission to move forward and increase mission readiness which in and will then move the entire navy's mission forward as well and if every command is doing that then the the entire projection of the navy is going to be in a more positive direction so you can see where that starts with the very most junior person and understanding what their strengths are and promoting those type of attributes and how that then rolls into the platoon or division or department that you work and strengthens that entire organization and that in turn strengthens the command moves on towards the rest of the fleet and then in turn the navy as a whole so I think you know the very first steps is is understanding what your junior personnel on the personal at your leading whether their junior or your peers or what have you what their strengths and weaknesses are and what their direction what influences them 
,,mario-pais,How do you set the tone as a leader? What is the right tone?,so the way that the way that I set the tone is as a leader within the platoons of divisions and even departments that I've lad is one that is kind of is very open and fluid I enjoyed I have you know face to face conversations with individuals my door is always left open anyone that works with me understands that they can come in and talk to me at any time and we'll hash it out if for some reason I can't really give them my undivided attention at that moment all set up another time to do that but then we do talk it's very candid I like to try and break down that hierarchy structure where you know maybe they see me as their leader chief and they might just be the E. three I like to get very personal because that way the individual feels like they can open up more as opposed to trying to be a little stifled because they see this or you know the chief from your working over them and that's not necessarily the best way to the kind of open up that dialogue and then when you open up that dialogue and you begin to understand what makes these people take then you can kind of help develop and guide their path and career into the direction that it needs to be with with their bias 
,,mario-pais,"What are the most common mistakes you've seen new leaders make? (e.g., skipping steps)",so I think one of the common things that I've seen leaders make that's a mistake and it is a challenge to kind of over com is not really understanding your people to the full intent as well as not understanding what your mission is in your requirements for that mission something that was asked me one time when I was sitting on SO keyboard years ago was you know what is more important the mission or your people and at the time I had said well my people the most important thing and then afterwards one of the board members pulled me aside and he said no your mission is always the single most important aspect to everything because without understanding the mission with that priority is and you can't really understand how to prioritize your people and take care of them and so you need to really understand the mission if you don't need to get out and read what your commander's intent is what they're guiding principles mission and vision are understand that and how you fit into that overall peace and then once you understand that you can then direct the folks that you lead into accomplishing that and once they know where they fit in and the overall spoke and how they can play a part in that big wheel and you'll notice that they're gonna make everything moved forward and everything kind of just will run seamlessly so you know without fully understanding your mission and without fully understanding your people that is going to put you out a hurdle and it's really hard it's really something hard to recover from 
,,mario-pais,"What problems need to be rooted out early, or you'll have trouble fixing them later?",so some problems that you need to understand early or else you could possibly have issues with them later on is your logistical requirements as far as you know what resources do you have and if you don't identify where your shortfalls are your resources that's going to play a part in what your overall mission successes as well as in a play a part in the mission success of your personnel that you're leading if you're missing those of those resources and you don't identify them early and we'll all we all understand that you know things kinda take time even if I under even if identify a shortfall right now in my resources it could take anywhere from three six months a year longer until maybe I see something back from that shortfall of identify that early now then hopefully that'll catch up to when I actually needed and having those resources identified well then allow me to move forward in the direction of my personnel as well as moving forward in the direction of the mission requirements 
,,mario-pais,How much leadership should you take charge of versus letting your senior petty officer lead?,so how much leadership should you take on if you're coming in to say that that first leadership position as a petty officer probably the PO the first thing you want to do is establish those expectations between your L. CPO and whoever you're all I see is it what are their expectations of you as now the LPO the person who's really down there every day dealing with the sailors face to face who probably knows more intimately about their things that are going on you know they're the command as well as behind the scenes you know so you need to get with your leadership and understand okay what are your expectations as the PO and also let them know what your expectations are as them as your leaders no they're not gonna be able to provide good service to you or the folks that you're leading as LPO if you don't provide them what it is you're looking for and as a leader you've got to be able to stay to talk to those that are in charge of you and ask them what their expectations are as well as what you expect of them as your leadership you can't be afraid to do that that's one of those challenges now that you're a leader is to to go out and talk to those folks that that or your superiors and and kind of give them your expectations as well and I think that kind of opens up that dialoguing and provides that cross you know that that flat line of communication so that way everybody's kind of running on the same gear 
,,mario-pais,How do I balance being close with my team versus fraternizing?,so the one way that you can meal bill that camaraderie with your team without you know cutting close that fraternization line it's it's a challenge to say the least right never it really depends on communities as well it varies across the board some communities are on first name basis with their folks throughout the entire triad weather communities is very formal and your dress them by their title and last name more just title only so what you have to do is you first got to figure out what kind of community are you in and what are the community norms and then work to those you know if you're in a more informal community you could kind of be looked at and ostracized as an outsider if you are too formal if you are in a community where things are you know formal and you were becoming a little more informal get it works that same way people gonna look at you a little bit different not take you seriously and is going to jeopardize your role as a leader so you got a first kind of figure out what community my end and then once you're in that you know play to those community norms but also make sure that the folks at your leading still understand where that leadership line ladies so sure you might work side by side with your people I've even on certain appointments I live in the same house the same tent establishment with my E. three and I was the senior chief here we all live together in the same community but there still was that that line that he still knew alternately that I was I was the leader in charge but we did have you know informal style discussions and talking together is a platoon so it's it's it's a challenge to say I think the first thing is you got to figure out what kind of community yet you are in it and what are those community norms and then work to that 
,,mario-pais,How have your priorities changed as your career progresses?,so I feel that my priorities of changes I've progressed as a leader in the fact that the the higher you move up in leadership the less and less your priority should be about your own self interest you know so early on when I was eight three E. four yes I did understand the bigger picture and working towards a common goal for the entire platoon the command in the navy as a whole but also is still very concerned about my own personal professional development and growth you know can I get on this school can I make this trip can I go to this deployment can I get you know get to this next commander get station here is very you know self centric working for myself and and the benefits of my family as you move up in leadership and as I moved up in leadership you know you no longer are supposed to be kind of really worried about yourself but you need to really start taking care of the folks that you're leading and and then doing good by them and and trying to progress their careers and improving their personal and for and professional development so as you move up in your leadership role you need to become more selfless than you were before and really focus on the folks at your leading and and making them the best that they can be because in the long run if your people are doing well then you yourself are gonna be noticed and looked upon you're going to do well in the end 
,,mario-pais,What does it take to really make a change in a team?,so what really makes changing a team especially if it's a big change is is getting that by and from the folks at your leading up you've got to be able to show them the reality of what that changes whether it's good or bad and you know explain to them what the over arching goal is and why in the long run it's probably gonna be the biggest benefit have those discussions not everyone is gonna is gonna buy in on that change you know some people are very adaptive to change and enjoy change and other people hate change you gotta understand where people thinking where they lie and then kind of played in those roles but your role as the leader is whether it's you know everyone agrees are doesn't agree at the end of the day you still have to move forward with this change is coming down from somewhere it's a new priority and probably in the long run it's going to be it's going to be better help them out as well as the navy as a whole so you have to kind of play that role 
,,mario-pais,How has your view of this line of work changed over time?,my view of the line of work that I've done and how it's changed over time is that is becoming more relevant now than probably it was even five years ago especially ten fifteen years ago so for example the line of work that I was doing we used to use marine mammals to try and find you know unexploded ordnance and mines under the water and now we've moved forward using unmanned underwater vehicles to do this line of work so what that does is it you know reduces the risk of personnel because you're not having to put essentially people within a mine field oral or animals in a mine field to find these things they can be miles away and you're still using equipment to do that as well as it's helping to reduce that time line that we have in mind countermeasures so as you know things change as technology changes and also to I've noticed that the navy and department of defense as a whole is starting to buy off on this entire you know you you UV or unmanned systems round you can see everywhere from the president's national security strategy on down the national defense strategy to our senior knows maritime for superiority you know one point and even to point documentation all the over arching instructions that govern what we do as a department of defense and as a naval forces a hole is really starting to buy off on unmanned systems and moving forward in that direction because they realize that it can exponentially do more work than we can with people as well as it also is reducing wrist a person out which is a good thing so those are kind of some of things I've seen change when the technologies change is that unmanned systems is becoming more relevant and what we do day to day throughout partner defense as a whole 
,,mario-pais,What priorities would you recommend for a person entering this field?,so the priorities that I'd recommend for you if you're entering into a leadership position is is read you have to read a lot of things you need to read you know what your commander's guidance mission vision and intent is and I understand what his bosses intent is you know so that you're is six has it has their own you know guidance in mission and vision statement and then continue to just turn a trickle up the line from his to your tight calms today and how that fits into this you know is objective to the secretary of defense's objective to than the president's objective if you can understand from that latter well you know that that there was a ladder rungs from you know your boss all the way up to the president and understand how you fit into that as a leader then not only is gonna make you more effective in your own dated a job but then you'll be able to effectively lead your people to accomplish those objectives that you from the top all the way down have in so you'll always be moving in the right direction in getting those those bigger objectives accomplished because you know how you fit into the over arching scheme of things that is probably my number one recommendation for a priority is just get in there and read your commander's intent and guidance all the way up 
,,mario-pais,What skills do you wish you had mastered before entering your profession?,certain skills that I wish I had mastered before it started was probably administrative skills so you earlier on in my career I was very good at the technical aspect of the operating aspect it wasn't until I really moved on to recruiting duty where I really had a hard look at my administrative skills because at that time we still kind of hand wrote contracts out and there was a lot of pages with that and if you made a single clerical error you had to kind of start all over again with the paperwork in so doing for years a recruiting duty will definitely make you blot better your ministry of side and so I wish I kind of had known that earlier on because it would save me a lot of late nights and a lot of do overs with paperwork and things like that as I moved on to having to be more straight administratively sound as I moved up in leadership positions and and my career as a whole 
,,mario-pais,What is one question you wished you asked earlier?,one question that I wish I had asked earlier in my career was just how to properly do and even even how to write an email you know it took me a little bit to understand that you that's probably the single most important document of your entire career U. sensually have eighteen lines to summarize what you've done in a year to show like the good work that you're doing and how you're impacting mission readiness is so I wish I'd known earlier the kind of things that it takes to actually write a good evaluation because not only would it help me out personally but then as you move up as a leader your sensually writing those evaluations on your people if your horrible it at eve all writing then your people are gonna suffer they could be doing the best work across the board but if you can't put that down in paper and quantify that in eighteen lines are less than your folks are gonna get overlooked for promotions so you know ask early on how do I write a good even I'll and what do I need to do to write those evaluations to meet what's being looked at 
,,mario-pais,"As a leader, how much more will I know about the overall goals of the work I am doing?",as a leader you should start understanding you know what those bigger goals are suppose just working on something you know at the at the more subordinate levels so sometimes you might have to go out of your way to find out what those over arching goals are you need to ask those questions you need to go to your leadership and ask them what their expectations are of you and what they want to see happen not within just your individual division or platoon or department but for the command as a whole so you got to really understand what those goals are not always is someone going to force feed that to you might have to go out of your way to find out what are my commands goals and how can I effectively make an impact in those goals or what are some deficiencies at my command has and how can I kind of you know chip away at those deficiencies and turn them from something negative into a positive and and move in that direction 
,,mario-pais,What was the most difficult part of your training?,something that was probably the most challenging for me and my training and I've had a lot of training in a variety of different places around the world doing a variety of different things is probably just that time away from my family there are there it I've I've missed both of my kids being born because of training or deployment in so those are things you can never get back and so that's probably been the most challenging for me is that time away even though I do have an understanding family wife who's can can operate independently and two kids now that are in high school and are able to kind of work on their own they don't necessarily need me around all the time I still want to be there to see them you know grass and succeed in and help out and do the fatherly thing but they also understand that that's not always going to be the case work in a line of work that we do so but that doesn't mean to me is it still was a personal challenge was was being away from family during during training or deployments 
,,mario-pais,"You are having a conflict in the first few days in your unit, Is that normal or no ?",having a conflict within your first few days of of a new unit that's that's entirely common that's not uncommon at all of your new so you got a new environment that you're trying to figure out and learn to and find out what those community norms are and then of course you're new to the people that have been there already in our established and so they're trying to kind of figure you out as well the biggest thing is communication Akon overcome those conflicts you need to communicate to the people that you may be having a conflict with or communicate to your leadership that you are having a conflict and how you can overcome that that's it but it's entirely common to have some sort of conflict whether it's external or internal when you arrive to a new unit 
,,mario-pais,How you can lead honorably,so in order to lead honorably you've got to have that that that word of integrity is as cliche as it sounds we hear it coming to boot camp all throughout your career you have to have that integrity but it's true and that's why it's brought up because if you can have that self integrity to to make sure that you're doing what needs to be done regardless of the situation regardless who's around then internally that's going to reflect on the people you're gonna lead and they're gonna want Amir that and model your behavior as well as the folks that are your leadership are going to notice that you have that integrity and that it's kind of being reflected within the folks that you're leading which in turn they're gonna be able to trust you with more responsibilities and probably give you a lot more flexibility as well because I understand that this isn't this individual has a lot of integrity folks there leading have a lot of integrity we can trust that person as well as that department or division that they're leading to get this job done without a lot of micro management or oversight so again as cliche as it sounds you know it I think integrity is probably that most important aspect 
,,mario-pais,"What are some good resources to look at before starting (books, videos, classes)?",certain resources that you'd want to look at as you're moving into a leadership position you know there's there's books all those things out there that people have written hundreds of books on leadership you know if the if that's the kind of thing that you're into and you like reading those type of books go on to your nearest book website find out the top ten and start reading those I also recommend that you understand what your leaderships overarching guidance and principles are so that you can be in step with what they're trying to do and so that goes from not only you know you're CEOs intent and guidance but his bosses boss and his bosses bosses boss all the way up to the highest levels and so you have you have to read those kind of documents and understand that structure and that's going to help you out and becoming a leader in making sure that it at the very least you're pointed in the right direction that your command the navy needs for you to be as your leading your subordinates 
,,mario-pais,What have you done that got a lot press?,something that I did they got a lot of press and actually made it back into my even my hometown newspaper was when I was marine mammal when I was a marine mammal handler we were deployed to Bahrain using the dolphins there the U. S. so you know they come in with celebrities all the time do visits on bass and somehow they got wind that there were navy dolphins there in the area that we're trained to find enemy swimmers and divers and so they ended up setting up a meet and greet with some of the people that they brought through from the US so so one of those individuals happened to be Ben Affleck we came down and I basically showed him the dolphins that we worked with I let him you know throw some fish to the dolphins and actually do a couple of tricks and there's a picture that was taken of Ben Affleck kinda kneeling down next to me is I'm handling this dolphin in front of them and that got kind of distributed out to the Associated Press and was then like kind of published worldwide on many newspapers from California all the way to Florida to the where you know even my hometown newspaper in Saint Pete had it there on one of the pages San Diego had it there was other places that was getting phone calls from friends and family around the country that was like Hey I saw you in our paper here so that was kind of a fun unique experience and I ended up saving like a clip of that paper and I still have it somewhere in a in a file or folder but yeah that was kind of a neat experience 
,,mario-pais,What is the best way to develop ones' skills in working in and with teams?,so one way that you can develop your interpersonal skills when you're working you know in a team or with the team is improve your your skills of communication and listening as well as the work on your ability to set goals for yourself as well as for the team you know it to approach a larger goal you may have to create you know micro goes to get to that and so that every single one of those is kind of a win and it builds up your self confidence it'll build up the team's confidence to ultimately get to this overall goal so that you can achieve that so you know work on your communication skills your skills of listening as well as just set you know personal achievable goals for you and your team that eventually hope you get to maybe what you think is an unachievable our over arching goal 
,,mario-pais,What leaders books have you read?,one leadership book that I've read that's related to you know military leadership has been the one by Jocko willing neck which is dichotomy of leadership he's got several other books that he's done on on leadership or co authored with some other people like leaf Babin I think they really kind of touch home on how to create and foster a culture within your organization how to build a team and how to become a better 
,,mario-pais,Is it dangerous for the dolphins and sea lions in EOD?,no I don't think it's dangerous for the dolphins and sea lines in your D. actually they have a better life working with us then they do if they were out in the wild they get some of the best medical treatment every day they get medical checks they get fed grade a quality fish the same kind of fish that are served at restaurants these animals are getting there they get great exercise they really have no threats from predators so that no I don't think there's a there's kind of any threat or harm placed on those animals 
,,mario-pais,Where are you getting your college degree?,right now I'm getting my college degree through Columbia College of Missouri I've actually done several college classes with the variety of different colleges throughout my career you know the navy has an agreement with with certain colleges that they'll all accept each other's credits so that way you're not necessarily pigeonholed to just going with one university or college and then you move in you know your stuff doesn't count anymore so you know here in San Diego Columbia College Missouri has a satellite school here and they've taken all my other credits from the other schools and universities that I've attended and I'm currently pursuing my bachelors in business administration with them 
,,mario-pais,Describe an experience that illuminates (Navy) culture,so a particular see story that I can remember was actually when I first checked in to you T. mobile unit three where I was gonna be doing marine mammal handling work and so I showed up you know an E. for in my dress whites and I checked in and you know the guys are already in the platoon space like you're the new check and I said yeah absolutely I like great we're going out to see real quick so here throw this on and come down out of the boat and we're gonna go out and work these animals and now I'm standing there with my packet of papers in my dress whites on and they throw me like some smelly fish smelling close we're shorts and a brown T. shirt they found like a pair of boots that I could wear and within ten minutes from from checking in in my dress whites I'm wearing you know this smelly outfit walking down to where the boats are at to get sea lions on board that we're gonna go work for the day having them dive down to like five hundred feet carrying a line to attach to training mines for for training these animals and so while we're out there that's where they they'll PO in the other the other folks around the boat you really start to get to kinda know me then we got back there like all right go head to shower up now you go upstairs and check into admin and get your other stuff ready to go and finish the check in process I think that was kind of a unique experiences kind of unconventional from what I heard of how you normally check in when you show up to a new command in the navy I actually enjoyed it that way looking back on it because it really got an opportunity for me to immediately understand what I was going to be doing to talk with the folks that we're gonna be leading me in the folks I was gonna be working with in kind of a on formal setting and then you step back into the formal setting put on my dress whites then go and finish the check in process I think that's kind of a unique experience the the for the navy in a cultural experience that were very C. driven were very work driven and so new guy shows up it's me like Hey we're going out on the water to go do some work and then you can worry about the administrative stuff afterwards 
,,mario-pais,"How do you help morale? (e.g., when the crew was supposed to go home but needs to stay active/at sea?)",so one way that you can you know improve morale if if given challenging task that's unexpected is it actually starts way ahead of that and that's you've got to kind of create and foster a culture with in your team that is used to having to deal with the unexpected and they understand why they're having to do it in the long run so you know when they do get throw these thrown these curve balls they're they're used to that and I understand that in the bigger scope there's a reason why they're having to stay late to work on something last minute because they have to accomplish an overarching objective mission or purpose but the only way that you can get them to start thinking that way is by having already foster that kind of culture earlier on you know prior to coming up with these these difficult situations 
,,mario-pais,Who are the core team members (inner circle) who you relied on as a leader?,the core team members that I've relied on in my inner circle as a leader has been everyone from the most junior guy up to you know the most senior person at my command everybody has something to offer you'd be surprised even than than most newest person that shows up who might be the most junior person within the team what times they have very good ideas because they come from a different diverse background that you never even thought of it so you've got to be able to take that on and ensure that they have merit regardless of their rank so I think everyone has something that they can provide his input and I lean on every single one of those people whether it's my PO whether it's the the deck plates semen up to you know my department head and you're listening to what their perspective is in using their mentor ship to help you know drive me 
,,mario-pais,"If you have trouble listening well, what strategies can help you listen well?",if you have trouble listening well some strategies that you can do is get out of your own head you effective communication there's a difference between a conversation and communication no communication is being able to actually sit and listen to what the other person is saying without being in your own head trying to figure out what you're going to say next because then you're gonna miss certain things that that person is telling you so one step and you can do is if you find yourself when somebody's talking but you're in your own head trying to figure out how you're going to continue to keep the conversation going or what you're gonna try and say next just stop stop trying to clear your mind and listen to what the person saying and also just be honest a lot of times when waiting to get past your own personal flaws is to let other people know that you have those flaws you can tell that individual you know what I'm sorry I was half listening to what you're saying if you wouldn't mind could you please repeat it so that I can I can hear you a little bit better and we can continue this conversation in this communication in a better light 
,,mario-pais,How do you handle supervisors who were unable or unwilling to give you feedback?,if I'm looking at getting feedback from a supervisor as trouble actually providing feedback is either unwilling or they're just not good at it I'll just have a blade in conversation with them you know I'll find a time where I can sit down with them and say you know listen I value your feedback I value your input I'm looking for that as an individual from you and seems that we have a challenge here what can we do to improve this relationship between you and I so that way you're able to provide the feedback that I'm looking for because I'm wanting that so that I can continue to do good work for you and for the organization as a whole she just gonna have to sit down and have that candid conversation with that person and let him know that you're not getting what it is you're looking for and is there is it an issue because of something maybe your doing internally or is it something that that individuals having that we need to figure out together 
,,mario-pais,What are marine mammals?,the navy's marine mammal program has been in existence since the early seventies where they were using dolphins and sea lions to conduct different operations for example the dolphins back in Vietnam were actually brought there and we're doing anti swimmer anti diver defense and cam Ranh bay and then the sea lions came online when they discovered that it was a lot more faster and effective to use the C. lines that can dive down to several hundred feet of depth to recover training minds as opposed to sending down a diver who could take you know hours to get down to a depth of that hook up and then come back to the surface so the navy's been using marine mammals since then to basically conduct you know mine countermeasures as well as anti swimmer and diver defense and they still continue to have them even though we are moving forward with advanced technology the marine mammal systems are still an option for the navy to use 
,,mario-pais,How do you set the tone as a leader? What is the right tone?,I went through something similar I'm not sure I'm not sure I can't hear you I can't hear you I don't understand I don't understand can you repeat that can you repeat that I don't have an answer for that I don't have an answer for that can you ask me something else can you ask 
,,mario-pais,How do you set the tone as a leader? What is the right tone?,steps to get to that large goals of setting those realistic ones kind of helps build that team morale build that unit cohesion eventually entire team is is capable of achieving a lot more than they originally thought they could because you've been fostering this kind of culture the entire time yeah yeah close up for just one second where is maybe a little like raspy or how it will work yesterday 
,,mario-pais,What are some of the things you do really well as a leader that someone could imitate?,something that I do as a leader that I think is recommend for anybody in that you could imitate is to be a leader you also need to be a reader right so if you look at some of the greatest leaders that we've had you know in the military or just in in life in general if usually been well read individuals and so you know something that you can do is just start to read doesn't even have to necessarily be our books on leadership just read period start reading something that you like in a particular subject or category that you enjoy and then you can kind of start maybe moving into more other challenging subjects were start really trying to read up on leadership through books find people that you admire and see if they've written a book on leadership again most of our motor oil well respected military leaders probably have something that they've created a written even if it's not a book it's probably some sort of you know memorandum or doctrine that they've written and you can read that and try and then emulate that in in your day to day conversations and work ethic and and those kind of things 
,,mario-pais,What are the most important decisions that you face daily as a leader in your organization?,so I face a lot of different decisions as a leader in my organization and it's the kind of unique to the military is composed to are compared to the civilian sector you know the civilian sector there it you whether your manager leader you're pretty much primarily concerned with getting the business moving forward in those kind of things are as in the military not only are you worried about mission a success and you know the operations but you also have to deal with the personal professional development of your people and in making sure that they're taking care of an actually looking into you know not only their per you know like the personal life like their family but are they moving in the right direction to progress their career and so you know it one day I can be dealing with making sure that we've got all the equipment necessary to go out and conduct high risk evolution or operation to making sure that the most junior persons family or wife is being able to get taken care of at tri care because they're having issues with medical or dental or how do they even go about doing that or register in a car because they just checked into this new command and they're coming from overseas duty that's something that's unique that you experience in the military but you won't see in the civilian sector and so you know you've got to be ready to deal with that entire gambit of of leadership as well as issues that are gonna come across to you 
,,mario-pais,How do I take lessons from officer school and apply them in real life?,ways that you can take lessons that you learned and any kind of leadership school our offer for schools and then trying to apply it in your day to day work is it you know you you've been just a lot you know a lot of times you might be drinking from the fire hose at these particular schools you're only going to remember so much maybe you've gotten those books you brought them back you've got your notes that you've taken in those schools reference those from time to time and trying to apply those theories and then and the lessons that you've learned you know little at a little bit at a time you know I could be able to take the entire thing walk right in and and know it all and be able to apply everything you've learned during that eight week school and think that you've got it but if you look at every little piece and then try and do it systematically bit by bit then you'll be able to really apply those lessons that you've learned and you might find that some of the stuff that you weren't those schools is kind of outdated and the curriculum maybe hasn't been updated in awhile and so it's no longer works that way but guarantee there's been some good golden nuggets that you've picked up at those schools that you can take in trying to apply a little at a time into you fully grasp the concepts 
,,mario-pais,What do you need to know about yourself to lead a team?,one thing that you need to know about yourself to lead a team is what are your flaws in what your weaknesses are again it's very easy to know what your strengths are but if you don't know what your weaknesses are and how to work on those and you're not gonna be able to improve yourself which in turn your can be able to improve your team so that I've usually done is no all sit down with the group as a whole after we've really developed like a good relationship in a team culture and I'll just ask the entire group you know no holds barred tell me like it is where where my family knew or how can I improve as your leader and actually get their opinion to be surprised the kind of things that you thought that you were doing right that you might be doing wrong in their eyes and then things that you thought were a weakness personally that they actually consider strength that you're doing correctly so you've got a every now and again sit down have those candid conversations with your team and let them tell you that the emperor has no clothes and then take that criticism and work on it 
,,mario-pais,What do you need to know about your team members?,what you need to know most about your team members it what is what drives them everybody has something that's different they have their own personal backgrounds everyone's got a different diversity they've grown up differently some of them have different morals and personalities so you got to kind of figure out what each individual is what makes them tick what drives them and then use that to your advantage as well as theirs to improve the team as a whole and move forward with the mission objectives 
,,mario-pais,What are the most important factors about a situation to consider?,some important factors when making decision and that you want to consider I think is ultimately is the juice work the squeeze you know is the risk worth is the reward worth the risk you need to look at what is the desired end state what is the actual desired intent at the end and then kind of work your way backwards from that to figure out what it is you're gonna need in order to achieve that that objective and make those decisions and then ultimately is it even worth moving forward in that path once I've discovered over all the other stuff that I've got to think about in the planning that's involved what are some secret sauce tips for your leadership style some secret sauce tips for my leadership style would be you know be an active listener communicate properly be relatable to the folks that you're leading so that they have trust in you and that they feel that they can come to you and talk to you about situations that you value their opinion and don't be afraid to to do the dirty work either I've found a lot of times you know you if you're a leader in let's say it's time to do clean up you know don't just ask your folks do clean up go out and grab the broom yourself and help start sweeping you'd be surprised how many other people are going to join when they see you as the leader out there sweeping up the P. way are cleaning up something everyone else wants to join in because like wow if he's willing to do this now what am I doing you know and that also shows your folks at your relatable nature able to get down to that level and to build that trust 
,,mario-pais,What leadership strategies are dying out?,one particular leadership style that I hope is dying out would be out of the the micro managing style you it's it's been proven to not be very effective it creates trust issues if you're constantly having to micromanage your people so I'm hoping that that's going away and that people start looking more towards you know being able to delegate down to the lowest person because that creates trust it also builds responsibility and also creates you know of a leader of leaders so even the lowest guy feels that they have value and that they're able to lead something even if it's just you know their own job that they're doing or another particular person is at the same rank as them it's starting to build their responsibility their leadership skills and that you know that feeds up as well as it trickles down so I'm hoping that the style of like micro managing and that abusive style of leadership is going away 
,,mario-pais,What are warning signs for problems in a team?,some warning signs that you might see with problems of your team morale is gonna be the first one if you're noticing that everybody is just down people don't enjoy being where they're at they don't joy the work that they're doing that should be one red flag right there and that's where you need to take time to step away gather the group up and find out what is going on that's that's decreasing morale another one that you're gonna find is just trust issues that are being with tested within the team people are trusting one another maybe they don't trust you maybe they don't trust their peers why is that happening because everyone should be able to trust one another within the team OB so those are two that I can think of right now that or where it red flags if you're having issues with that issues within the team 
,,mario-pais,How can you enforce the honor code?,way that you can enforce an honor code is you've got to start creating that culture within your team early on holding people accountable and making sure that they hold themselves accountable you've got to build a team that's capable of having thick skin and that is able to take criticism if you know you notice that one of your teammates is doing something wrong or is messing up on something you've got to have the strength to tell them like Hey you're not doing this right and then they also got to be able to take your criticism and not feel that you're attacking them but you're only just trying to help them which is ultimately going to try and help improve the team so you've got a foster foster that that culture with in of accountability and having thick skin so that everyone can talk to one another because they ultimately no you're just trying to help them out as a teammate which is ultimately going to help the team and that feeds all the way up 
,,mario-pais,What kinds of sailors cause problems in a team and what can you do to improve it?,you might find that certain sailors in your team cause problems in one way that you can improve that is making sure they all understand what their purposes you'll find a lot of times that people really don't know why they're doing what they're doing or why they're there a simple way to find that out is just sit down with each person individually and ask them you know why are you here don't be condescending when you ask obviously but see if they actually understand what their purpose is why are they doing the job that they're doing why are they coming in every day from nine to five working on this particular mission objective equipment what have you and and really people that back you'll find a lot of people really don't understand why they're doing what they're doing and you gotta keep kind of probing and don't take their first answer as the form because it's more than likely going to be superficial you might have to actually educate them on why they're here and how they fit in to the bigger picture and once they really understand that and why that third why they're doing what they're doing and how they're actually part of a larger goal then they're gonna have that buy in and hopefully they'll start improving the issues that you're having with some of those people 
,,mario-pais,How do you get to the root of a problem with a team member?,a way to get to the root of the problem with the team member is just active communication you have to sit down you've got to tell them that you're having an issue with them show them relevant proof of you know what you've been noticing you know it certain even if it's kind of documented but on document doesn't actually have to be punitive but if you can you can mention like listen you know here's certain things that I've seen on this particular day there was this issue on this particular day there's was that and really show them what the kind of problems that you're having and then find out what's going on with them there might be something personal that's happened in their life that you're on aware of that's causing them to be unfocused and maybe you can find that and help them resolve those issues or there's something else is going on that you're on aware of that you need to talk to them about but the biggest thing is just that communication and having the strength to sit with that individual and let them know that there is an issue and we need to get to the bottom of it and figured out 
,,mario-pais,When is breaking the rules okay?,when is breaking the rules okay it's kind of a loaded question but so I think before you can even attempt to try and break the rules you got a fully understand what they are first why were they put in place the reason behind that and are they even still applicables because you have no idea when those were actually written so you really really need to fully understand what the rules are before you start to try and break or bend them and then when you do decide that like you need to step outside the black and white start operating the gray you know what is the risk versus reward am I gonna cause damage to personnel or equipment am I willing to accept that risk is that gonna cause detriment to the mission overall if you find that you know those none of those apply and that in order for you to get to your objective because you're working in kind of this no man's land and it requires you to break the rules then go forward with it obviously you know try and get authorization first but if you happen to be in a situation where you're the one that needs to make that decision then make that executive decision after you've done a quick thought analysis and decided that I need to step outside the bounds here in order to get this accomplished and I'll deal with the consequences later so that's something that you really need to think about when you're starting to try and bend or break the rules 
,,mario-pais,How can I tell when someone can be influenced versus someone who won't change?,the way that you can tell if you're able to influence someone or whether they're you they're just not going to change is body language is kind of key so let's say that you're trying to get something new across to a group of individuals and you know you start noticing that several individuals are nodding their head they they kind of have a tendency to to agree with you or the providing supporting comments that's an individual that you can probably influences gonna get that by in and help you out got other individuals why you're putting out the same information and their body language is indicative that they're disagreeing arms maybe crossed their not providing you eye contact they're looking away that's an individual who's going to be a little bit more stubborn that you're gonna have to try maybe convince or work on who has their heels kinda dog in is reluctant to to make that change 
,,mario-pais,What conduct issues can mean serious problems if you handle them in-house?,there's certain conduct issues that you know you don't want to deal with in house because it's gonna put not only that individual's career at jeopardy but your yours as well as the leader you've got to figure out which ones need to get past up and which ones can you handle at your level certain things like you know anything that has to do with domestic violence crimes out in town or crimes against the organization those major type of things that's not something that you want to keep your level that something needs to get elevated up for the command to understand kind of take care of it and will relieve you from having that that overall burden you don't want to be the only one with the secret because it's going to come in and buy chin the end 
,,mario-pais,Tell me about a time where your priorities conflicted with the priorities of your management.,one particular situation that comes to mind when my team and I had a disagreement on how to hit how to handle something was when I was on recruiting duty I was working with a particular applicant who we thought we're is going to be ready to process but that individual ended up having some personal issues that kind of prevented them from getting the maps on time for them to conduct the physical and then eventually signed the contract and come into the delayed entry program I had to explain to the rest of my team including the supervisor at the time that this individual just is not ready to go over there because they're having some significant personal issues which I discussed with them however the team still felt that those were things that we could work around that individual could still go on the day that we had decided so that they can come in and join and be marked off as a as accounting contract I kind of stood by what I needed to do and and protected that individual I got a lot of Flack for it however the following week note after all the stuff it subsided we were able to get that individual in the contract still counted for the for the month which is what we're looking for we had a particular goal we had to achieve that month but you know we were there arguing for quite a bit and I really had to stand my ground on that and it ended up being the right outcome 
,,mario-pais,Tell me about a situation where your team and you had a major disagreement about how to handle something.,one particular time where I had a disagreement with the people that I was leading and how to handle that situation was when it came to working hours so I had just moved into a new command I'd taken leadership of this new division they were all instructors and prior to their previous leader their you know their major focus was time off like they were under the impression that this you shore duty is supposed to work as less as possible and they really didn't care about how other people's careers were progressing so I came into that situation and realize that more than half of those individuals in there were still lacking on certain qualifications or certain milestones that they should have already hit having been at that command for as long as they had and so I kind of put out that listen we know things are gonna change a little bit this time of you getting out of here by noon every day since you don't have a class in session you know is going away until you can show me that you've achieved this particular qualifications that your least working towards it and making an admirable effort no working hours are gonna be what's set by the commanding officer as eight to four and we got into a pre heated discussion in an argument about that there's people that were very adamant that thing shouldn't change we should be able to do what we want to do and leave when we need to and I tried to explain to them that listen in the long run you know you're probably gonna thank me for this even after you leave the commander not gonna quite understand what I'm getting at but understand that there is a method to my madness and the whole point of that was that it not only is going to increase your personal and professional development it's gonna enhance your career over also improving the commands mission readiness because the more people that we have qualified as say master training specialist and that's going to improve our commands mission readiness we're gonna have a lot more effective training that's going to reciprocate down to the people that we are training here on a daily and weekly basis and then ultimately you're gonna look back and be glad that you got this qualification because of the opportunities you're gonna have not only in the service but when you get out and so after that he discussion eventually got the buy in people started to work on those qualifications they got them done and then we were able to go back to having kind of a you know flexible working hours because everyone was where they needed to be with their milestones in qualifications but it was incredible challenging it tested my fortitude on being very direct and not budging on with the rest of the group wanted to do which was you know maintain the status quo 
,,mario-pais,What kind of risks do you need to take in this field?,so some different risks that we take in this field not kind of approach it two fold one is you would restore we take duty wise and job wise and wrist that you might have to take as a leader so as far as the duties concern you know working with the E. U. D. community and conducting mine countermeasures and we're working in austere environments around the world operating from small boats in all varying types of C. state are sometimes with little to no oversight with maybe only the protection that we have with us in that small boat working around explosives or having to find certain mines you know working in a in a mine field or even near mine field is just risky in an inherent danger just that alone you know also it being a diver you know I'm dealing with the risks that you intend you and you feel with diving whether it's cold water and the different gas laws and coming up too fast for sending in those kind of different things so a lot of different risk that we deal with as a job and do decide as a leader you know the risks that you're going to deal with is far as you know careers that you're working with their their personal professional development are you steering that individual in the right way or you providing them the right advice you know there there's a risk in that his name they're gonna be taking what you say as as attentional gospel and truth and you could possibly be staring them down the wrong path that has the make a wrong decision and it falls back on you and so there is that risk that you're dealing with is you could possibly be jeopardizing other people's careers or livelihood for that matter so those are the things you gotta considering the risks that I deal with in my job as well as out of being a leader 
,,mario-pais,What problems or warning signs should you not try to solve and refer up to specialists instead?,some problems that you know I wouldn't try to resolve but would rather trying to get help to the profession you know get that person help from a professional or use the resources would be definitely anything that has to do with like marital problems you know I can give my advice and what I've done to keep my relationship going for the last eighteen nineteen years being married with two kids but after that I'm gonna have that individual go and get the actual proper counselling they need whether that's from the chaplain fleet and family because you know I'm not a marriage counselor I can just only give you like my opinion on certain things to maybe help but that's that's as far as I can go on get the right person to help that individual out of also anything that has to just do with say suicidal risk you know I have been trained to recognize certain flags and tendencies and and do it I can't my level but after that I'm gonna get that individual to the right either medical person or chap plan or support personnel that can really provide that individual with the help that they need because even though I'm trained to a certain level I'm at no no needs are at I'm no way an expert in dealing with that and so god for bid I'm responsible for somebody hurting themselves because I didn't get them the help that they needed so those are kind of two examples I can think of that you're able to provide some level of help at your level but you need to then get those individuals to the right people who are experts in that field 
,,mario-pais,What do you do when given an impossible situation due to failures that you didn't cause?,so what you can do if you're given an impossible situation and you're dealing with failures that you didn't cause is you still need to figure out are you alternately the one that's responsible if you are the one that's responsible then you still gotta take ownership in that as hard as that pill is to swallow you're responsible for the outcome of that situation in that mission and so you need to take ownership of it even if the failures necessarily weren't yours if it's something that was completely out of your control and you obviously need to bring that up to your chain of command and show the steps that you took to try and achieve this impossible mission to make it a reality and those factors that you were out of your control that cause you to fail but also to you want to limit the amount of plane that you're putting on outside organizations are outside factors because at the end you're still probably the one that's ultimate responsible need to own that so you're gonna have to walk around that very delicately and and figure out you know how you can convey that message to your superiors without placing blame on somebody else 
,,mario-pais,"How do you deliver bad news, such as a family emergency?",so the way that I deliver bad news as an example like a family emergencies I'm definitely direct with the person I don't try and dance around with the issue is obviously if it's something that's a personal issue that the person is to be aware of such as a family emergency when a poll that individual aside and somewhere quiet we're just the two of us can discuss the issue but I'm not going to dance around I'm going to get right to it and say Hey listen just got a phone call such and such happened you know here's what we're gonna be able to do for you what do you need help with and how can we make this happen but the easiest way when it comes to bad news is just be direct and don't try and sugar coat it I think people appreciate that because able to get to the issue right away 
,,mario-pais,Why do people leave the Navy?,people leave the navy for a variety of reasons summer just out of your control some are the individual and only intended on join in and doing for years and moving on because they just wanted something different they wanted that experience and maybe they wanted the benefits that came with being in the navy and some of those that they'll get going out so you can't feel that you know you have to try and keep everyone in service because you have no idea what that person's ultimate goals and objectives are just have to find out what the real what they are and then help get them to achieve that of other people leave the navy because they just got disenchanted with it maybe they had a bad experience and they no longer want to be part of the organization and that's unfortunate hopefully you're not the one that caused that feeling in that individual to where they wanted to leave the service but you know people leave for a variety of reasons summer controllable some aren't you just have to figure out what motivates everybody on your team and help them get to their goals that they wanted to 
,,mario-pais,What else do I need to know?,what else do you need to know while well let's talk one thing I think you you can take away is you know as a leader do not be afraid to fail that's okay because you learn from your failures and at least you put forth an effort and you tried and you kind of discovered what maybe your limits are and then you can figure out how to improve those limits so you know it's okay to fail you fail fast but then win big and come back from that and overcome that failure and and continue to keep trying and and being innovative in pushing the envelope but you just you can't be afraid to fail 
,,mario-pais,What's up?,not much I just got back from travel and so this week I'm getting caught up on a few emails developing curriculum and where we need to be out to continue training some of the platoon's every becoming through starting next week

Why?,one of my favorite books and I don't know if it's of all time but one book that I have read more than others kind of over and over again is Stephen press fields gates of fire I really enjoy that book is basically kind of a of of fictional take about the non fictional battle of Thermopylae and the near the Spartans going against Persia and there's a lot of good kind of values on leadership in some nuggets in there that are kinda good takeaways just an overall great story so that's kind of one of my favorite books that all have a tendency if to read if I don't have anything else to read all kind of re read that book over again 
,,mario-pais,What's your favorite movie of all time? Why?,my favorite movie of all time that's a tough one because I have so many that I do enjoy I will say like for example when it comes to action movies I do kind of like some of the older like eighties early nineties action movies like predator in the original like terminator terminator two running man like anything that had Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger as far as like action movies Ozell ones that I kind of enjoy from that error but really if a favorite movies kind of hard for me to to say right now 
,,mario-pais,"If you could meet anyone in the world today, who would it be and why? What would you say to that person?",if I could meet anyone in the world today I think it would actually be probably Warren Buffett I'm actually call quite interested in and how he came to to be where he's out financially I've read several books and clean his biography called snowball and so I think he'd be an interesting individual just to sit down he's got a wealth of knowledge to just talk finances and just as overall fought on you know where were moving as in a

D. community originally was a marine mammal handler so working now and using dolphins and sea lions to find mines under the water or training shapes or enemy divers and swimmers so that was a pretty fun experience to now what I do which is using on man underwater vehicles or robots to find things under the water is so I've enjoyed doing that for the last eighteen years is probably been someone was fun activities I've I've got to do 
,,mario-pais,What is the best military perk you experienced?,I think the best military perk that I've experienced has been the ability to use the navy's tuition assistance are to go to school while I'm in so you know as long as I've got the opportunity and the work schedule that allow me to take college in the navy is willing to pay for that it's probably been the biggest perk I'm close to achieving my bachelor's degree and I've done all that well I've been in service for the last eighteen years the navy's paid a hundred percent of that tuition so that's been like the biggest part that I can see for me personally 
,,mario-pais,What advice do you have for someone trying to complete training like OOD underway?,my recommendation if you're trying to achieve a certain qualification that is kind of high level is what you're going through the qualification process just completely immerse yourself in that process really understand what you're doing read all the references that are associated with that qualification highlight certain sections that you think are applicable in that you need to know and that you want to reference again later in the future take as much notice as you can ask other people that are already qualified in that what made them successful and how they got qualified and immerse yourself in that process and make that kind of your your main focus while you're really trying to get that qualification 
,,mario-pais,What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?,one challenge that I've faced kind of my entire career is the fact that I'm doing kind of unconventional work as a whole maintenance technician if you actually talk to somebody who is an H. T. you know and explain to them what it is I do they'd probably come and tell you that that's that's not what an H. T. does and so I've had a challenge with with progressing in making rank because I'm view it is not working in rate doing on conventional work is an H. T. even though I kind of disagree with that that thought process because I am filling the role or the billet of NH T. it just so happens that it's not traditional H. T. work so somewhere somebody in the navy felt that an H. T. needs to be doing this and so that's what I'm doing and the way that I've overcome that is just continually to perform in whatever duty I've been given so you know if there's certain qualifications that I need to have I'd I get those and I and I and I totally understand them and then I also help other people get them so you have to if you're faced with a situation like that you really have to perform and show that you deserve to be doing what you're doing and to get to where you're going and so it one of my biggest challenges is you know how do I make rank I and show that I you know have leadership value in that I have value as an H. T. when I'm not doing that work 
,,mario-pais,What is the most challenging part about your job?,I think one of the most challenging parts of my job is just you know when I ask myself am I being successful am I a doing what needs to be done for the betterment of the organization and my also taking care of the people that I'm leading as probably one of my biggest challenges is to make sure that the actions and decisions that I'm making are having a positive impact on the organization as a whole as well as having a positive impact on personal professional development of the people that I'm leading 
,,mario-pais,What is the biggest failure you ever had and what did you learn from it?,so I think the biggest failure that I've ever had was starting up my career you originally came in to be see in the navy so after my initial a school training I went on to their basic underwater demolition school our buds where I was there for a couple months and then got to basically the third night of hell week and I didn't complete the program and so I've been or finished out of that hell week not completing it and and didn't graduate from buds after that and I was pretty devastated because that had been an initial dream a passion of mine for a very long time from there I kind of lucked out and was able to get into the EOD community now doesn't you D. technician but just working with the community as a marine mammal handler and I was still very young so I also noticed that my maturity level probably wasn't right at that time when I was trying to go through to become a seal and also I was newly married I had a child already another one on the way and so in retrospect looking back necessarily wasn't a bad decision of what happened and I actually learned a lot from that there's a lot of things that I even learned in the time that I was there that I've used since I've been in as far as you know value and integrity and leadership skills that I've taken with me and so you are even being devastated after that failure you know it's gonna happen you're able to bounce back from that and just find the silver lining in everything and then find a good situation that you're in and build on that please 
,,mario-pais,What are the failures for which you are the most unhappy?,for me the failures that I'm most unhappy about or those that I have not had an opportunity to go back and fix it finish it was maybe I started a particular project and it just didn't get off the ground or start a particular program and we got to a point to where it was a complete failure and we've decided to move on and do something new but there's still that lingering thought of you know if only I could've applied this much more effort or maybe if I'd done this differently we could have at least completed it so you know my personality I don't like to leave things unfinished and so those failures that have not been fully vetted outer finished completely still kind of bother me from time to time 
,,mario-pais,How accepting of failure is this work environment when a good and honest effort was made?,in the community that I work in you know if you fail but you've actually showing that you've applied all your effort you've made a valiant attempts to to be successful they're okay with that I mean one of our monikers here is fail fast in win big and win big so you know failure is okay as long as you've put forth all the effort and you really try especially if it's something that's new it's on navigated waters that you're doing for the first time and you thought you put forth their best effort and you fail at it okay let's learn from that let's figure out how we can get past that and continue to move on 
,,mario-pais,What are sources of support when you took a chance and the result was poor?,support that I've had when I've taken a chance in the results been poor have been not only from subordinates and my peers but also just are my superiors as well because they're aware that maybe what we're trying to do was outside the norm or it was you know of a stretch that it was gonna be an achievable goal but we still put forth an effort we tried our best and in the end you know it just didn't happen so you know with the subordinates feel that like they know that they did the best they could they feel that they were led the best they possibly could and we still feel it failed all right that's okay so their support from them here's obviously they're working with you side by side on things to get that accomplished and then this appears you probably were the ones that they gave you the task and knew that it was somewhat unachievable the just wanted to see if you can get there and you failed well you know they're going to support you as well 
,,mario-pais,"How does someone recover from a professional ""bump in the road""?",so way that you can recover from a professional bump in the road is one don't let it define you let it you know learn from it I understand that it happened take ownership of an acknowledge that it's happened but then learn from those mistakes and keep moving if you constantly dwell on that professional bump then you're gonna find that it's just going to continue to compounding snowball into other ones that you're gonna continue to have and it's a lingering it's a lingering effect so you know don't let it define you and move on from it but learn from it 
,,mario-pais,What was a pivotal moment in your career/life?,a pivotal moment for me in my career was when I finally was selected for chief petty officer not only you know I've been given responsibilities a lot you know up to the E. six level but once I put on you know the the the chief uniforms started wearing the anchors a lot more responsibility was given to me in a lot more flexibility that allowed me to make decisions on my own without as much oversight and so that was really a pivotal moment for me was was making chief 
,,mario-pais,What's the biggest risk you've taken in your career?,for me the biggest risks that I've taken in my career is just the path that I've actually chosen to do you know I'm not working as a traditional H. T. in the navy so I've been kind of working what some would say out of rate but it's it's paid off for me in the long run and throughout my career you know even as a junior person I would hear all you're never if you continue on the path that you're doing you're never gonna make chief and then I made it and then I was up for orders and decided to continue working in a program that I was really good at the people wanted me in and that I could continue to excel at and I heard well you're never gonna make senior chief if you continue to go down this route and then I made senior chief so are you I think working in the career that I've done was a wrist that I took but it's worked out in the end for me and I hope it continues to do so as I'm eligible for master chief this upcoming cycle 
,,mario-pais,What is the most dangerous thing you've ever done on the job?,some of the most dangerous things that I've done on the job I also consider maybe being some of the most fun because I do have a tendency to gravitate towards you know adrenaline rush type type thing so you're working with explosives jumping out of helicopters diving working in small boats you know launching from the back of an L. H. D. at night where the sea states a little iffy in a small boat where you have the potential of getting overturned there on the well deck on the stern gate near that can be kind of dangerous but also find those those challenges kind of exhilarating and fun so you know for me things that look kind of dangers have a tendency to also turn in to be something that's enjoyable and and find 
,,mario-pais,What causes the most stress in your job?,I think what causes the most stress for me and my job is am I a doing what's required for the betterment of the organization in the command of the people that have actually taken a a lot of race to get to get me to where I'm at so for example mentors and my superiors some of them have done a lot of things to get me in the position that I'm at and I wanna make sure that every waking moment on basically repaying them for for getting me to where I'm at today and so I want to make sure that the work that I'm doing is good in that it's it's better in the organization and making them proud so those are kind of things that I I think about worry 
,,mario-pais,How do you deal with stress on the job?,the way that I deal with stress on the job is I first acknowledge that that there is a stressful situation I don't run from those activities are those stressful situations kind of trying to embrace him and the sooner that you embrace them and understand that you're going through something stressful the fast you're gonna you're gonna be able to overcome that but the first step is just to acknowledge it and then figure out what you got to do to to lessen that stress 
,,mario-pais,What is a trick that you use to keep stress from boiling over?,a trick that I used to keep stress from blowing over is one I'll talk about it if I am feeling stressed either talk about it with the people that I work with or my spouse at home the other thing is I just trying to find humor in the most difficult stressful situations even some that you think is riskier stressful there's usually some sort of underlying humor that you can associate to it which will lighten the mood and hopefully kinda keep bring the stress level down 
,,mario-pais,How do you handle self doubt?,one way that I handle self doubt is trying to reflect on previous achievements that I've had before or maybe I doubted myself then but then having continued on and and persevered I was able to get through and be successful so if I'm coming across another situation I recognize that okay I'm having self doubt again what did I do the previous time to overcome this and trying use those same tactics to overcome the current self doubt that I'm having 
,,mario-pais,How do you handle fatigue at work?,the way that I handle fatigue at work is I just push through it to be honest you know it really depends on what's at hand if it's something it's extremely important that requires me to continue regardless if I'm fatigued or not I understand the bigger picture and I'll just keep driving Ford in it if it's something to where you know it okay obviously this is something that can wait till tomorrow and I'm getting fatigued then I'll probably take a break and I'll come back to that evolution the next day or more well rested and can probably provide a lot better response that situation and I could if I was fifty but depending upon it sometimes you just have to push through that fatigue recognize that weakness and an overstep it drive Ford 
,,mario-pais,How do you ensure that boring work gets done well?,one way that you can insure boring work gets done well is to associate link it to a bigger purpose I understand that even though this may be boring it has probably an internal part into something bigger into the larger picture of things and also just try and make the boring work fun as well there's there's something that you can probably turn that boring work into being something find humorous and enjoyable so you have to look for those situations 
,,mario-pais,How do you deal with an increase in tempo?,so with that all deal with an increase in tempo is off first identify why are we having this increase and is it achievable and if it's something that I know that I can take on for another extended period of time and and meet those requirements because the tempos increase and I'll continue with it and I'll try and foster that same culture morale throughout the team that I'm working with but also to I got to recognize when there is too much and that possibly that temple is going to either start breaking me down or other individuals in my team and recognizing everybody certain level of being able to accept an increase in that tempo some people can take on more than others some people they are able to deal with stressful situations better than others and other people need a little bit more time or need a break before they can they can get their temple increased so you have to recognize that as a leader within your people figure out when to make those decisions and then just be vocal about it as well if you're noticing that increase in tempo and it's going to have long lasting or detrimental effects on you and your team you've got to let folks know that you know you're gonna have a hard time meeting this increased tempo because a lot of times they might not even be aware if they piled on this this increase to you that your it's something that you just can't achieve until you voice your opinion and let it be known 
,,mario-pais,What are common crimes people in your field commit that need to be watched for?,I think you know maybe one that does it in a in our field as well as maybe just across the board as a whole is you alcohol abuse and maybe the crimes that come with that you know depending upon the job that you're doing a lot of times it can be stressful environment you're doing stressful things is for people to kind of on wine from that and and step out of that mindset well times a lean to to the use of alcohol or other substances and you know there's nothing wrong with having a drink here there but if individual start abusing that alcohol and then that starts leading to issues at work missing work problems with their home life or even do you wise things like that then that's something that you need to be really aware of so you have to kind of understand your people understand what makes them tick understand when they're having a good day and one's a bad day even if they don't vocalize that and see if it has anything that has to do or related to you know alcoholism 
,,mario-pais,What part of your future are you most worried about?,part of my future that I'm most worried about is the time that I start getting ready to retire which you know I'm not sure when that's going to be but I am poaching that window soon essentially could retire after this tour of duty it'll put me at twenty one years and I really don't know what I'm gonna do next I do have several opportunities and things that I can do in the outside world if I do decide to retire but you know this is been my way of life for the last eighteen years soon to be the last twenty one years and so you know now moving to somewhere different where I don't have the same security that I'm used to the same medical dental benefits the same pay the same access to educational benefits I'm kind of out there finding on my own that's that's a little bit scary for me so your retirement actually I think is is what kind of worries me as I approach that time 
,,mario-pais,"If you could change one thing about your job, what would it be?",if I could change one thing at my job I think that would be the the acquisition process so a lot of times you know you'll identify a shortfall or a need for a resource and because the certain things that are put in place right now some of the bureaucratic red tape that you have to go through in order to get that resource the time you've identified it that's usually the time that you actually need it but then when you requested it could take weeks months maybe even a year more into you finally actually see it and by then it's too late I needed that thing a year ago so you know I think you as the navy continues to move forward they are looking at ways to streamline the acquisition process and get equipment and resources into the end users hands a lot faster but it can be frustrating right now when you need that piece of gear that equipment today and the soonest that you're gonna see is probably gonna be months from now 
,,mario-pais,What used to be your biggest weaknesses?,one of my biggest biggest weakness is that I've made a valiant effort on improving however I still have a lot of work to do in that aspect is Nero I guess you could consider it my time management skills or basically is taking my work home with me a lot of times you know I'll be at work here from the morning till the late afternoon and then I end up taking some of that work home and I'm still working on it at home late at night my family you know is always wondering why am up till ten eleven o'clock working on something like did I do that during the day while I was at work and so it really kind of takes away from that family time and that's a huge weakness of mine that I have is just not being able to separate you know my work life style from my personal and family life and so I've been getting better at that I've actually made certain lakes stoppers where if I find myself at home working on something for work and it's now approaching you know eight or nine o'clock at night and I'm still doing it I I will stop where I'm at and and discontinue that and pick it up on the next day as opposed to continuing to work till ten eleven midnight on something so I'm trying to get better at that but there's definitely a weakness that I have that I feel I'm making improving steps towards 
,,mario-pais,How do I deal with an assignment that I don't like or that isn't a good fit?,way that you can deal with an assignment that you don't lie occur that you don't feel is a good fit is you first try maybe voice that to the people that are signing you that that you know it's not something that you think you can do or that you want to be in perhaps they can get a change but if you don't tell anyone about it or at least tell the right people and nothing's going to happen if you're still kind of stuck in that position then you need to try and find out why am I here there's gotta be a particular reason what is the bigger picture that I'm helping out with and find what your purpose is with doing there more than likely there is some sort of reason why they have you in that assignment that job and you just don't know what it is so you need to find out what that purpose is the bigger picture of it and then you know of it and and go through and make the best of that situation 
,,mario-pais,What things are there for me to do while deployed?,so you know depend upon where you're deployed in and what organization combatant commander that you're helping you know you might be during that full deployment costly working you know that's what the deployment is for is you're actually now applying all the training all the skills that you've achieved over the last several years or months or what have you and you're actually applying those on a in a realistic environment to conduct you know some sort of operation or or deployment schedule so you might find yourself just just working constantly and applying the skills that you retain however more than likely you are gonna have some down time throughout the deployment and it really just depends on where your station we're deployment is if you're on a ship in your deployed and you have some down time there's probably several activities they're going to be on board to kind of alleviate and break up that schedule of of just constant workload if maybe you're stationed overseas somewhere in your own a deployment and you're on a base I know definitely all those bases have some sort of you know M. W. R. facilities that provide things on base out of town that you can do and take advantage of those so really just depends what your deployment is where deployed how you deployed and you know what you're gonna be able to do for for relax 
,,mario-pais,How do you set the tone as a leader? What is the right tone?,are you married I'm married I've been married for close to eighteen years now and I've also got two kids both of which are in high school okay this is the easier one I probably say the ages do you have any kids I have two kids one knows who's going to be turning sixteen in November and the other who will be turning eighteen this January 
,,mario-pais,How do you set the tone as a leader? What is the right tone?,the recording there're successes and failures when it comes time for evaluation periods in and helping out with writing there you either house so some of the very first task you're gonna have is is understanding your people understanding your job and you know we do that is is reading and and getting educated in those areas this is a real question we have from I think it came from someone how can I make paperwork
