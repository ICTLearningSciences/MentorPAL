D. community here one of which was we had a particular piece of gear one of our you you vis which is about twelve feet in length and weighs about six hundred pounds and it's really been tied to launching recovering from an eleven meter read and these eleven meter ribs you can only move them in theater from one place to another based on particular err strategically for choir miss that are there it's very difficult to kind of get aircraft that you can fit an eleven meter ribbons side so we thought outside the box and figured how can we move this piece of equipment using the most smallest platform that we have in our arsenal which is a very small combat rubber rating crafter creek so this was out on deployment and we found kind of a construction site that had some left over plywood and foam and we basically developed a sled device that we were able to pull this vehicle up on two in tow behind our smallest platformer smallest creek that had just a thirty five horsepower engine and still be able to be combat effective and deploy the equipment searching for mines all across the theater so from that are admiral happened actually see what we have developed out of wood and phone Khan and got nicknamed the spruce goose and later he actually funded a program to develop a more robust proto type and here we are five years later we actually have eighteen of these operational prototypes being worked right now they've gone through several different iterations and there now part of the X. MCM companies tower table of allowances and they deploy with these things that provide us an opportunity to basically get to where we need to without being strong arm to using the eleven meter crew of red ,What is a story that really shows what it is like working in your job?
s001p006s00021220e00032010,"JobSpecific,STEM",so one of the major benefits my job what I think is great about it is just the diversity that you experience every single day it's really not the same thing every single day you're given many opportunities to kind of think on your own and be responsible even our most junior personality very early start in their career are given tremendous responsibility where that's leading personnel or the responsible for multi million dollars worth of equipment I don't think you can really find that and many other places not even within the navy at some points as well as in the civilian world I mean what civilian job do you know is going to give an eighteen year old the ability to make you know critical decisions as well as be in charge of millions of dollars worth of gear that is gonna potentially cause impact or threat to not only friendly forces but to our enemy forces so that's kind of one of the biggest benefits of working in this community is the fact that you are really given a lot of freedom in the way and looked at as an intellectual adult who's able to make decisions and and moved the ball forward for progressing the force in the community ,"What are the major benefits of doing this kind of work?

s001p006s00054514e00062125,"JobSpecific,Motivation",so one of the main reasons why I love my job is the fact that it's kind of an unconventional a job in the navy with what we're doing with a man under water vehicles in the mine countermeasures role we're given a lot of flexibility were given the ability to be innovative and creative think outside the box and adapt to certain challenges that come to us and I like that aspect of the of working in this community is the fact that it's not always the same thing every day and they really they really like to see individuals that can that can think on their own and create these kind of innovative solutions to the tasks at hand ,"Why do you love your job?

s001p006s00103100e00115028,"First Steps,JobSpecific",so what I do now that's different than what I thought I was going to be doing is not originally joined the navy to come in to be a navy seal and during that time you actually had to pick a source rating before you can go on to seal training so I asked the the detailer that was there at maps you know what's the short is a school you have because I have no intention on doing it and he said Hey all maintenance technician so I asked what's that it's welding okay yeah I give it to me I'll do that short school so went through boot camp when on my following a school for whole maintenance technician and welding and then went on to bud's where I didn't make it all the way through the program so I ended up having to become a whole means technician where I ended up actually moving on to io de is my first command in doing marine mammal handling and working in that aspect and because of the job that I had done initially with the EOD I've actually been managed to maintain an entire career within this community and never really have actually worked within the whole maintenance tech job so you know originally came in to be a CEO and then all maintenance technician as a secondary platform and now here I am a senior chief in the navy that actually uses on man underwater vehicles to do mine countermeasures for the navy as a whole ,What do you do now that is different from what you thought you would be doing?

s001p007s00003010e00011301,First Steps,so what I think makes a good leader is somebody who is also a good listener in order for you to lead your people effectively also have to be able to understand and listen to what your people's needs are and understand what mission requirements are you you can't just automatically jump in immediately trying take hold of something and and leave from the get go or else you're not gonna get any buy in from the personnel that you're trying to lead so it's best to get together with them first and kind of understand what their challenges are what their strengths are and then build from that and then not allow you to lead that entire group for such always making a positive impact for the command in the navy as a whole ,What makes a good leader?
s001p007s00012304e00023614,First Steps,so I think the first steps that when you have a new leadership position is obviously getting to understand your people first and and understanding what their strengths and weaknesses are and how you can use those to progress not only their personal and professional development for but the group as a whole as long as the group is moving forward and that in turn is going to allow the commands mission to move forward and increase mission readiness which in and will then move the entire navy's mission forward as well and if every command is doing that then the the entire projection of the navy is going to be in a more positive direction so you can see where that starts with the very most junior person and understanding what their strengths are and promoting those type of attributes and how that then rolls into the platoon or division or department that you work and strengthens that entire organization and that in turn strengthens the command moves on towards the rest of the fleet and then in turn the navy as a whole so I think you know the very first steps is is understanding what your junior personnel on the personal at your leading whether their junior or your peers or what have you what their strengths and weaknesses are and what their direction what influences them ,What are the most important first steps in a new leadership position?
s001p007s00024413e00035224,First Steps,so the way that the way that I set the tone is as a leader within the platoons of divisions and even departments that I've lad is one that is kind of is very open and fluid I enjoyed I have you know face to face conversations with individuals my door is always left open anyone that works with me understands that they can come in and talk to me at any time and we'll hash it out if for some reason I can't really give them my undivided attention at that moment all set up another time to do that but then we do talk it's very candid I like to try and break down that hierarchy structure where you know maybe they see me as their leader chief and they might just be the E. three I like to get very personal because that way the individual feels like they can open up more as opposed to trying to be a little stifled because they see this or you know the chief from your working over them and that's not necessarily the best way to the kind of open up that dialogue and then when you open up that dialogue and you begin to understand what makes these people take then you can kind of help develop and guide their path and career into the direction that it needs to be with with their bias ,How do you set the tone as a leader? What is the right tone?
s001p007s00040518e00053101,First Steps,so I think one of the common things that I've seen leaders make that's a mistake and it is a challenge to kind of over com is not really understanding your people to the full intent as well as not understanding what your mission is in your requirements for that mission something that was asked me one time when I was sitting on SO keyboard years ago was you know what is more important the mission or your people and at the time I had said well my people the most important thing and then afterwards one of the board members pulled me aside and he said no your mission is always the single most important aspect to everything because without understanding the mission with that priority is and you can't really understand how to prioritize your people and take care of them and so you need to really understand the mission if you don't need to get out and read what your commander's intent is what they're guiding principles mission and vision are understand that and how you fit into that overall peace and then once you understand that you can then direct the folks that you lead into accomplishing that and once they know where they fit in and the overall spoke and how they can play a part in that big wheel and you'll notice that they're gonna make everything moved forward and everything kind of just will run seamlessly so you know without fully understanding your mission and without fully understanding your people that is going to put you out a hurdle and it's really hard it's really something hard to recover from ,"What are the most common mistakes you've seen new leaders make? (e.g., skipping steps)"
s001p007s00061004e00070927,First Steps,so some problems that you need to understand early or else you could possibly have issues with them later on is your logistical requirements as far as you know what resources do you have and if you don't identify where your shortfalls are your resources that's going to play a part in what your overall mission successes as well as in a play a part in the mission success of your personnel that you're leading if you're missing those of those resources and you don't identify them early and we'll all we all understand that you know things kinda take time even if I under even if identify a shortfall right now in my resources it could take anywhere from three six months a year longer until maybe I see something back from that shortfall of identify that early now then hopefully that'll catch up to when I actually needed and having those resources identified well then allow me to move forward in the direction of my personnel as well as moving forward in the direction of the mission requirements ,"What problems need to be rooted out early, or you'll have trouble fixing them later?"
s001p007s00134328e00150714,First Steps,so how much leadership should you take on if you're coming in to say that that first leadership position as a petty officer probably the PO the first thing you want to do is establish those expectations between your L. CPO and whoever you're all I see is it what are their expectations of you as now the LPO the person who's really down there every day dealing with the sailors face to face who probably knows more intimately about their things that are going on you know they're the command as well as behind the scenes you know so you need to get with your leadership and understand okay what are your expectations as the PO and also let them know what your expectations are as them as your leaders no they're not gonna be able to provide good service to you or the folks that you're leading as LPO if you don't provide them what it is you're looking for and as a leader you've got to be able to stay to talk to those that are in charge of you and ask them what their expectations are as well as what you expect of them as your leadership you can't be afraid to do that that's one of those challenges now that you're a leader is to to go out and talk to those folks that that or your superiors and and kind of give them your expectations as well and I think that kind of opens up that dialoguing and provides that cross you know that that flat line of communication so that way everybody's kind of running on the same gear ,How much leadership should you take charge of versus letting your senior petty officer lead?
s001p007s00164820e00184015,First Steps,so the one way that you can meal bill that camaraderie with your team without you know cutting close that fraternization line it's it's a challenge to say the least right never it really depends on communities as well it varies across the board some communities are on first name basis with their folks throughout the entire triad weather communities is very formal and your dress them by their title and last name more just title only so what you have to do is you first got to figure out what kind of community are you in and what are the community norms and then work to those you know if you're in a more informal community you could kind of be looked at and ostracized as an outsider if you are too formal if you are in a community where things are you know formal and you were becoming a little more informal get it works that same way people gonna look at you a little bit different not take you seriously and is going to jeopardize your role as a leader so you got a first kind of figure out what community my end and then once you're in that you know play to those community norms but also make sure that the folks at your leading still understand where that leadership line ladies so sure you might work side by side with your people I've even on certain appointments I live in the same house the same tent establishment with my E. three and I was the senior chief here we all live together in the same community but there still was that that line that he still knew alternately that I was I was the leader in charge but we did have you know informal style discussions and talking together is a platoon so it's it's it's a challenge to say I think the first thing is you got to figure out what kind of community yet you are in it and what are those community norms and then work to that ,How do I balance being close with my team versus fraternizing?
s001p007s00185715e00201719,"Background,First Steps,Priorities",so I feel that my priorities of changes I've progressed as a leader in the fact that the the higher you move up in leadership the less and less your priority should be about your own self interest you know so early on when I was eight three E. four yes I did understand the bigger picture and working towards a common goal for the entire platoon the command in the navy as a whole but also is still very concerned about my own personal professional development and growth you know can I get on this school can I make this trip can I go to this deployment can I get you know get to this next commander get station here is very you know self centric working for myself and and the benefits of my family as you move up in leadership and as I moved up in leadership you know you no longer are supposed to be kind of really worried about yourself but you need to really start taking care of the folks that you're leading and and then doing good by them and and trying to progress their careers and improving their personal and for and professional development so as you move up in your leadership role you need to become more selfless than you were before and really focus on the folks at your leading and and making them the best that they can be because in the long run if your people are doing well then you yourself are gonna be noticed and looked upon you're going to do well in the end ,"How have your priorities changed as your career progresses?

s001p007s00202805e00212701,First Steps,so what really makes changing a team especially if it's a big change is is getting that by and from the folks at your leading up you've got to be able to show them the reality of what that changes whether it's good or bad and you know explain to them what the over arching goal is and why in the long run it's probably gonna be the biggest benefit have those discussions not everyone is gonna is gonna buy in on that change you know some people are very adaptive to change and enjoy change and other people hate change you gotta understand where people thinking where they lie and then kind of played in those roles but your role as the leader is whether it's you know everyone agrees are doesn't agree at the end of the day you still have to move forward with this change is coming down from somewhere it's a new priority and probably in the long run it's going to be it's going to be better help them out as well as the navy as a whole so you have to kind of play that role ,What does it take to really make a change in a team?
s001p007s00221116e00240028,JobSpecific,my view of the line of work that I've done and how it's changed over time is that is becoming more relevant now than probably it was even five years ago especially ten fifteen years ago so for example the line of work that I was doing we used to use marine mammals to try and find you know unexploded ordnance and mines under the water and now we've moved forward using unmanned underwater vehicles to do this line of work so what that does is it you know reduces the risk of personnel because you're not having to put essentially people within a mine field oral or animals in a mine field to find these things they can be miles away and you're still using equipment to do that as well as it's helping to reduce that time line that we have in mind countermeasures so as you know things change as technology changes and also to I've noticed that the navy and department of defense as a whole is starting to buy off on this entire you know you you UV or unmanned systems round you can see everywhere from the president's national security strategy on down the national defense strategy to our senior knows maritime for superiority you know one point and even to point documentation all the over arching instructions that govern what we do as a department of defense and as a naval forces a hole is really starting to buy off on unmanned systems and moving forward in that direction because they realize that it can exponentially do more work than we can with people as well as it also is reducing wrist a person out which is a good thing so those are kind of some of things I've seen change when the technologies change is that unmanned systems is becoming more relevant and what we do day to day throughout partner defense as a whole ,"How has your view of this line of work changed over time?

s001p007s00241015e00252626,"Advice,First Steps,Priorities,STEM",so the priorities that I'd recommend for you if you're entering into a leadership position is is read you have to read a lot of things you need to read you know what your commander's guidance mission vision and intent is and I understand what his bosses intent is you know so that you're is six has it has their own you know guidance in mission and vision statement and then continue to just turn a trickle up the line from his to your tight calms today and how that fits into this you know is objective to the secretary of defense's objective to than the president's objective if you can understand from that latter well you know that that there was a ladder rungs from you know your boss all the way up to the president and understand how you fit into that as a leader then not only is gonna make you more effective in your own dated a job but then you'll be able to effectively lead your people to accomplish those objectives that you from the top all the way down have in so you'll always be moving in the right direction in getting those those bigger objectives accomplished because you know how you fit into the over arching scheme of things that is probably my number one recommendation for a priority is just get in there and read your commander's intent and guidance all the way up ,"What priorities would you recommend for a person entering this field?

s001p007s00253620e00263326,First Steps,certain skills that I wish I had mastered before it started was probably administrative skills so you earlier on in my career I was very good at the technical aspect of the operating aspect it wasn't until I really moved on to recruiting duty where I really had a hard look at my administrative skills because at that time we still kind of hand wrote contracts out and there was a lot of pages with that and if you made a single clerical error you had to kind of start all over again with the paperwork in so doing for years a recruiting duty will definitely make you blot better your ministry of side and so I wish I kind of had known that earlier on because it would save me a lot of late nights and a lot of do overs with paperwork and things like that as I moved on to having to be more straight administratively sound as I moved up in leadership positions and and my career as a whole ,What skills do you wish you had mastered before entering your profession?
s001p007s00272710e00283612,First Steps,one question that I wish I had asked earlier in my career was just how to properly do and even even how to write an email you know it took me a little bit to understand that you that's probably the single most important document of your entire career U. sensually have eighteen lines to summarize what you've done in a year to show like the good work that you're doing and how you're impacting mission readiness is so I wish I'd known earlier the kind of things that it takes to actually write a good evaluation because not only would it help me out personally but then as you move up as a leader your sensually writing those evaluations on your people if your horrible it at eve all writing then your people are gonna suffer they could be doing the best work across the board but if you can't put that down in paper and quantify that in eighteen lines are less than your folks are gonna get overlooked for promotions so you know ask early on how do I write a good even I'll and what do I need to do to write those evaluations to meet what's being looked at ,What is one question you wished you asked earlier?
s001p007s00290522e00300100,First Steps,as a leader you should start understanding you know what those bigger goals are suppose just working on something you know at the at the more subordinate levels so sometimes you might have to go out of your way to find out what those over arching goals are you need to ask those questions you need to go to your leadership and ask them what their expectations are of you and what they want to see happen not within just your individual division or platoon or department but for the command as a whole so you got to really understand what those goals are not always is someone going to force feed that to you might have to go out of your way to find out what are my commands goals and how can I effectively make an impact in those goals or what are some deficiencies at my command has and how can I kind of you know chip away at those deficiencies and turn them from something negative into a positive and and move in that direction ,"As a leader, how much more will I know about the overall goals of the work I am doing?"

s002p005s00165715e00175628,"Leadership Strategies,Leading a Team",a way to get to the root of the problem with the team member is just active communication you have to sit down you've got to tell them that you're having an issue with them show them relevant proof of you know what you've been noticing you know it certain even if it's kind of documented but on document doesn't actually have to be punitive but if you can you can mention like listen you know here's certain things that I've seen on this particular day there was this issue on this particular day there's was that and really show them what the kind of problems that you're having and then find out what's going on with them there might be something personal that's happened in their life that you're on aware of that's causing them to be unfocused and maybe you can find that and help them resolve those issues or there's something else is going on that you're on aware of that you need to talk to them about but the biggest thing is just that communication and having the strength to sit with that individual and let them know that there is an issue and we need to get to the bottom of it and figured out ,How do you get to the root of a problem with a team member?
s002p005s00220616e00233012,Leadership Strategies,when is breaking the rules okay it's kind of a loaded question but so I think before you can even attempt to try and break the rules you got a fully understand what they are first why were they put in place the reason behind that and are they even still applicables because you have no idea when those were actually written so you really really need to fully understand what the rules are before you start to try and break or bend them and then when you do decide that like you need to step outside the black and white start operating the gray you know what is the risk versus reward am I gonna cause damage to personnel or equipment am I willing to accept that risk is that gonna cause detriment to the mission overall if you find that you know those none of those apply and that in order for you to get to your objective because you're working in kind of this no man's land and it requires you to break the rules then go forward with it obviously you know try and get authorization first but if you happen to be in a situation where you're the one that needs to make that decision then make that executive decision after you've done a quick thought analysis and decided that I need to step outside the bounds here in order to get this accomplished and I'll deal with the consequences later so that's something that you really need to think about when you're starting to try and bend or break the rules ,"When is breaking the rules okay?

s002p005s00290227e00303011,Leadership Strategies,one particular situation that comes to mind when my team and I had a disagreement on how to hit how to handle something was when I was on recruiting duty I was working with a particular applicant who we thought we're is going to be ready to process but that individual ended up having some personal issues that kind of prevented them from getting the maps on time for them to conduct the physical and then eventually signed the contract and come into the delayed entry program I had to explain to the rest of my team including the supervisor at the time that this individual just is not ready to go over there because they're having some significant personal issues which I discussed with them however the team still felt that those were things that we could work around that individual could still go on the day that we had decided so that they can come in and join and be marked off as a as accounting contract I kind of stood by what I needed to do and and protected that individual I got a lot of Flack for it however the following week note after all the stuff it subsided we were able to get that individual in the contract still counted for the for the month which is what we're looking for we had a particular goal we had to achieve that month but you know we were there arguing for quite a bit and I really had to stand my ground on that and it ended up being the right outcome ,Tell me about a time where your priorities conflicted with the priorities of your management.
s002p005s00333128e00361506,Leadership Strategies,one particular time where I had a disagreement with the people that I was leading and how to handle that situation was when it came to working hours so I had just moved into a new command I'd taken leadership of this new division they were all instructors and prior to their previous leader their you know their major focus was time off like they were under the impression that this you shore duty is supposed to work as less as possible and they really didn't care about how other people's careers were progressing so I came into that situation and realize that more than half of those individuals in there were still lacking on certain qualifications or certain milestones that they should have already hit having been at that command for as long as they had and so I kind of put out that listen we know things are gonna change a little bit this time of you getting out of here by noon every day since you don't have a class in session you know is going away until you can show me that you've achieved this particular qualifications that your least working towards it and making an admirable effort no working hours are gonna be what's set by the commanding officer as eight to four and we got into a pre heated discussion in an argument about that there's people that were very adamant that thing shouldn't change we should be able to do what we want to do and leave when we need to and I tried to explain to them that listen in the long run you know you're probably gonna thank me for this even after you leave the commander not gonna quite understand what I'm getting at but understand that there is a method to my madness and the whole point of that was that it not only is going to increase your personal and professional development it's gonna enhance your career over also improving the commands mission readiness because the more people that we have qualified as say master training specialist and that's going to improve our commands mission readiness we're gonna have a lot more effective training that's going to reciprocate down to the people that we are training here on a daily and weekly basis and then ultimately you're gonna look back and be glad that you got this qualification because of the opportunities you're gonna have not only in the service but when you get out and so after that he discussion eventually got the buy in people started to work on those qualifications they got them done and then we were able to go back to having kind of a you know flexible working hours because everyone was where they needed to be with their milestones in qualifications but it was incredible challenging it tested my fortitude on being very direct and not budging on with the rest of the group wanted to do which was you know maintain the status quo ,Tell me about a situation where your team and you had a major disagreement about how to handle something.
s002p005s00402214e00421521,"JobSpecific,Leadership Strategies,Risk",so some different risks that we take in this field not kind of approach it two fold one is you would restore we take duty wise and job wise and wrist that you might have to take as a leader so as far as the duties concern you know working with the E. U. D. community and conducting mine countermeasures and we're working in austere environments around the world operating from small boats in all varying types of C. state are sometimes with little to no oversight with maybe only the protection that we have with us in that small boat working around explosives or having to find certain mines you know working in a in a mine field or even near mine field is just risky in an inherent danger just that alone you know also it being a diver you know I'm dealing with the risks that you intend you and you feel with diving whether it's cold water and the different gas laws and coming up too fast for sending in those kind of different things so a lot of different risk that we deal with as a job and do decide as a leader you know the risks that you're going to deal with is far as you know careers that you're working with their their personal professional development are you steering that individual in the right way or you providing them the right advice you know there there's a risk in that his name they're gonna be taking what you say as as attentional gospel and truth and you could possibly be staring them down the wrong path that has the make a wrong decision and it falls back on you and so there is that risk that you're dealing with is you could possibly be jeopardizing other people's careers or livelihood for that matter so those are the things you gotta considering the risks that I deal with in my job as well as out of being a leader ,"What kind of risks do you need to take in this field?

s002p005s00423015e00440128,Leadership Strategies,some problems that you know I wouldn't try to resolve but would rather trying to get help to the profession you know get that person help from a professional or use the resources would be definitely anything that has to do with like marital problems you know I can give my advice and what I've done to keep my relationship going for the last eighteen nineteen years being married with two kids but after that I'm gonna have that individual go and get the actual proper counselling they need whether that's from the chaplain fleet and family because you know I'm not a marriage counselor I can just only give you like my opinion on certain things to maybe help but that's that's as far as I can go on get the right person to help that individual out of also anything that has to just do with say suicidal risk you know I have been trained to recognize certain flags and tendencies and and do it I can't my level but after that I'm gonna get that individual to the right either medical person or chap plan or support personnel that can really provide that individual with the help that they need because even though I'm trained to a certain level I'm at no no needs are at I'm no way an expert in dealing with that and so god for bid I'm responsible for somebody hurting themselves because I didn't get them the help that they needed so those are kind of two examples I can think of that you're able to provide some level of help at your level but you need to then get those individuals to the right people who are experts in that field ,What problems or warning signs should you not try to solve and refer up to specialists instead?
s002p005s00451405e00462212,Leadership Strategies,so what you can do if you're given an impossible situation and you're dealing with failures that you didn't cause is you still need to figure out are you alternately the one that's responsible if you are the one that's responsible then you still gotta take ownership in that as hard as that pill is to swallow you're responsible for the outcome of that situation in that mission and so you need to take ownership of it even if the failures necessarily weren't yours if it's something that was completely out of your control and you obviously need to bring that up to your chain of command and show the steps that you took to try and achieve this impossible mission to make it a reality and those factors that you were out of your control that cause you to fail but also to you want to limit the amount of plane that you're putting on outside organizations are outside factors because at the end you're still probably the one that's ultimate responsible need to own that so you're gonna have to walk around that very delicately and and figure out you know how you can convey that message to your superiors without placing blame on somebody else ,What do you do when given an impossible situation due to failures that you didn't cause?

s002p007s00015214e00031918,Challenges,one challenge that I've faced kind of my entire career is the fact that I'm doing kind of unconventional work as a whole maintenance technician if you actually talk to somebody who is an H. T. you know and explain to them what it is I do they'd probably come and tell you that that's that's not what an H. T. does and so I've had a challenge with with progressing in making rank because I'm view it is not working in rate doing on conventional work is an H. T. even though I kind of disagree with that that thought process because I am filling the role or the billet of NH T. it just so happens that it's not traditional H. T. work so somewhere somebody in the navy felt that an H. T. needs to be doing this and so that's what I'm doing and the way that I've overcome that is just continually to perform in whatever duty I've been given so you know if there's certain qualifications that I need to have I'd I get those and I and I and I totally understand them and then I also help other people get them so you have to if you're faced with a situation like that you really have to perform and show that you deserve to be doing what you're doing and to get to where you're going and so it one of my biggest challenges is you know how do I make rank I and show that I you know have leadership value in that I have value as an H.

s002p007s00120116e00133815,Challenges,so I think the biggest failure that I've ever had was starting up my career you originally came in to be see in the navy so after my initial a school training I went on to their basic underwater demolition school our buds where I was there for a couple months and then got to basically the third night of hell week and I didn't complete the program and so I've been or finished out of that hell week not completing it and and didn't graduate from buds after that and I was pretty devastated because that had been an initial dream a passion of mine for a very long time from there I kind of lucked out and was able to get into the EOD community now doesn't you D. technician but just working with the community as a marine mammal handler and I was still very young so I also noticed that my maturity level probably wasn't right at that time when I was trying to go through to become a seal and also I was newly married I had a child already another one on the way and so in retrospect looking back necessarily wasn't a bad decision of what happened and I actually learned a lot from that there's a lot of things that I even learned in the time that I was there that I've used since I've been in as far as you know value and integrity and leadership skills that I've taken with me and so you are even being devastated after that failure you know it's gonna happen you're able to bounce back from that and just find the silver lining in everything and then find a good situation that you're in and build on that please ,What is the biggest failure you ever had and what did you learn from it?
