00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.160
you know, I don't really know. I mean, my my overall guesses that there's

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.470
 some kind of course of study that you need to do. And then there's

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.790
 probably like, an internship and maybe some kind of exam that you

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.100
 have tow our multiple exams. I think the best thing, if you want to

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.410
 know about this, is to find somebody who is in that field and ask them.
