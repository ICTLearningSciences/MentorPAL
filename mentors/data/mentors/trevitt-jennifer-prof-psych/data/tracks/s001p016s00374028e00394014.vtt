00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.460
in general, The higher your g p a, the better your chances. This is one

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.070
 of those easy metrics that admission boards are going to use to essentially

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.680
 wade through a ton of applications like this is one of the

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.290
 first metrics they're going to use to just dump applications. Um, oftentimes,

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.900
 schools will tell you, you know, unless you have a G p a

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.510
 of 3.6, like, don't bother applying. So the the list their minimum g

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.120
 p a um and I would say for the most part, take that seriously. Like

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.730
 don't bother applying if their minimum g p a is 3.7 and you've got

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.340
 a 3.2. The chances that you're going thio your application is even gonna

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.950
 make it past the first round are probably pretty low. Um, the exceptions

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.560
 to this are if you have a personal connection somehow with

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.170
 the this program. So, for instance, if you or maybe working with someone

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.780
 right now and they have a colleague at this other unit at this

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.390
 other program at another university that you're interested in, um and

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.000
 they say, you know, I'll reach out personally to my colleague here

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.610
 and say, toe, Look out. You know, I'll give you a personal recommendation

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.220
 and say toe, look out for your application. And you know, I

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.830
 would also say that if that's the case, you want to address this head

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.440
 on in your personal statement? Why your GP a does not meet the minimum.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.050
 So if there's a reason for it, you better explain yourself. Um,

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.660
 and and in that situation, I would say go ahead and apply. I mean,

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.270
 you still might not make it, but, you know, you would definitely have

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.880
 a better chance at that point. Um, most schools are looking for a

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.490
 G p a of around 3.6 or higher, so that's kind of what you're you're

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.100
 in that neighborhood. Um, if you if your GP is 3.6 or higher, you're

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.710
 probably good for most applications. Yeah,
