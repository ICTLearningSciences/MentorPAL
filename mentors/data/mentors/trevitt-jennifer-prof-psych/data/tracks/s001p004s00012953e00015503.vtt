00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.950
That is an excellent question. I believe that I am 51 years old because

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.050
 I was born in 1969. The math is hard. And also, you may find that

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.150
 when you get older, these things don't matter so much. And so you don't

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.250
 keep track of them the way that you used to. So I think I'm 51.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.350
 I'm gonna put my money on that.
