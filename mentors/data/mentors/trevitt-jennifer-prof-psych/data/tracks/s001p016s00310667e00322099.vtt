Yeah, the cost of graduate school can vary widely, and it depends on a

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.140
 couple of things. It depends on what type of program you're going to.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.780
 So, for instance, you know a master's program is generally going

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.430
 to cost less than a PhD program is going to cause, because it's just

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.070
 it's less time. Um, another factor that may influence that is whether

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.720
 there is there are employment opportunities like within the department.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.360
 For instance, toe offset some of the costs of either tuition

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.010
 or books or living expenses or something like that. Um, some departments

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.650
 even offer stipends to their students, or they offer things like

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.300
 reduce costs, housing eso. There are a lot of things that are gonna

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.940
 affect kind of the overall total cost of going to graduate school.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.590
 I would certainly recommend, um, contacting the graduate schools that

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.230
 you are interested in and seeing, or you know what things they offer

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.880
 to help offset the cost of attending graduate school. Because you

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.520
 may be surprised there may be a lot of things that they offer that

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.170
 you weren't aware of
