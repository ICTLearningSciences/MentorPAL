00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.290
So one time when my kids were little like I'm gonna say around two, we

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.740
 went hiking with, um not really hiking hiking because they were only

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.180
 two. So we went on kind of maybe more of like a nature walk. Um and

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.630
 so my husband and I were talking and, you know, I'm kind of like all

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.070
 the time, just counting, counting, counting, making sure all the

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.520
 kids were there, Um, and all of a sudden I was like, I couldn't find

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.960
 one of my daughters and i e I started to panic, and I was looking around

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.410
 and looking around. I couldn't find her. I turned to my husband

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.850
 and I was like, Where is Katherine? Where did where is she? She's

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.300
 lost and he looked at me and he's like, Are you OK? And I'm like, Dude,

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.740
 our child is missing like get let's go, Let's figure this out. And

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.190
 you just started laughing at me, and I was really, really close to

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.630
 punching him because I was just like, First of all, this is the most

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.080
 inappropriate reaction ever, like our child is missing and you were

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.520
 laughing at me, and he's like she's on your head and I had picked

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.970
 her up and I had put her on my shoulders, and I just I forgot that

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.410
 she was on my shoulders and so all I knew was that she was just It was

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.860
 kind of like, you know, when you're looking for your glasses and

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.300
 they're on your head, it was just It was my child this time.
