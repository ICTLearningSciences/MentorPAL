00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.950
I would visit the financial aid department at Cal State Fullerton. Um,

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.050
 you could also try the career center they might know mawr Thio about,

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.140
 like, possible grants and fellowships and scholarships that are available.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:21.240
 You could talk to the department, Uh, in the psych department.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.340
 We do offer various scholarships and fellowships that students

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.440
 can apply for. And when you know, based on what they're doing, they're

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.540
 not usually much. But often times, you know, you can you can get

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.640
 a bunch of them and, you know, all of a sudden it starts to add up.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.730
 Thio pretty good chunk of change. Eso you. They're also government websites

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.830
 out there. I think in psychology the American Psychological

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.930
 Association, the A p A, um, has a list or something of possible, um,

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.030
 grants and fellowships and scholarships that are available, um, either

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.130
 through the A p a or through other organizations or association.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.230
 So that might be another resource that you could check out. Um, but

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.320
 probably I would direct you first to the financial aid office of whatever

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.420
 school you're at right now, because they'll probably have a lot

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.520
 of information for you.
