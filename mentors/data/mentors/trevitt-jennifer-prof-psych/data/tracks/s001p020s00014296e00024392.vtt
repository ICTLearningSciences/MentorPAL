00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.390
balancing school and work and home life is really tricky. And I think

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.930
 that one of the tips that I could give you here is to first of all,

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.480
 be realistic about really, how much time you have and how much time

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.020
 you could devote to each of these things. The second piece of advice

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.560
 I would give you is Thio. Understand that it's not like you're going

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.100
 to be giving equal attention Thio all aspects of your life all the

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.640
 time. Things usually come in waves, so there may be some time. Some

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.180
 days when you're spending more time on work or more time on school

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.730
 or more time on family and as long as kind of like in the end, it all

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.270
 balances out, then that's just fine, Um, but it's usually never going

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.810
 to be equal all the time.
