00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.020
I think that you have to look at this from the perspective of you're making

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.190
 an investment. When you when you pay for graduate school, right,

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.360
 you're investing your time and your investing your money. And so

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.540
 to me, what that means is that the most important thing is that I am

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.710
 successful in graduate school. I want to get the most out of this investment

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.880
 that I've made of my time and money. Um, and I think that

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.050
 to do that, you really need to prioritize being a student over being

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.220
 anything else. So anything that you're doing that's not being a student

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.390
 is essentially detracting from your ability to be a student. Um

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.570
 And so in that case, I would say the preferable alternative in terms

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.740
 of your ultimate success and graduate school is to take out loans

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.910
 as opposed to to try to hold down a job at the same time. Now, you may

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.080
 be able to find a job that works into your schedule and, you know,

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.250
 and doesn't take away from, for instance, your study time or something

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.420
 like that. Um, you know, it may also depend on your situation.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.600
 Um, but in general, you know if you're a graduate student, whether it's

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.770
 a master student or a PhD student, it is expected that your full

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.940
 time job is being a student.
