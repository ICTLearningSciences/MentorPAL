whether or not you goto graduate school really kind of depends on what

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.130
 you want to dio. So, for instance, there are some jobs like my job

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.770
 that you have tow have a doctoral degree in order to be able to do it.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.410
 So this is a kind of a prerequisite for this type of position is

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.050
 you have to have a PhD. Um, but they're not that many jobs that have

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.690
 those kinds of requirements. So graduate school really is an investment

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.320
 of both your money and your time s. So I think it's really important

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.960
 for students to kind of think about what it is they ultimately

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.600
 want to be doing and then do some research and find out if the people

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.240
 who are doing those things, what kind of degrees do they have? Because,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.880
 you know, maybe you don't need a PhD. Maybe you just need a master's

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.520
 degree. Um, in which case, you probably be better off doing

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.160
 a Masters program instead of opting for a PhD
