00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.680
I have some regrets, but not many. To be honest, I'm very, very happy

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.510
 and satisfied with my life with multiple aspects of my life. And so

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.340
 every step of this journey has brought me here. And while some of them

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.170
 weren't pleasant, they were necessary because I wouldn't have gotten

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.000
 here unless I had taken this journey. And so in that sense, I don't

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.830
 really have that many regrets. Um, when I look at my life in terms

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:41.660
 of my career, but also just in terms of my life in general, I have

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.490
 very few what I call do over moments, like if I could do this over

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:53.320
 again, I would do it differently because even the times of my life

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.150
 that have been hard, that have been full of, like, fear or sadness or

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.980
 anger, all of those were instructive and help me figure out my path,

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.810
 and the path has brought me to where I am. And so I'm can't argue

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.640
 with that. I'm very happy with where I am
