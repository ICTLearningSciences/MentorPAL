00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.880
I'm going to say meetings, committee meetings, that its committee meetings

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.920
 are hard committee meetings. Sometimes they could be awesome, But

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.950
 honestly, a lot of times they're very long and they're very boring.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.980
 So and at the end of the day, oftentimes I'm like, Do we even accomplish

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.020
 anything here? Like we just sat together in a room for three

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.050
 hours and I don't even know what's different? So I think that that's

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.090
 probably if I had to point a one thing that is my least favorite part

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.120
 of my job. It's probably committee meetings.
