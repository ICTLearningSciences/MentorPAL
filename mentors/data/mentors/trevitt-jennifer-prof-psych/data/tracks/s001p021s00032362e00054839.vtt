00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.020
that is such a great question. And there are. There are a lot of different

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.190
 answers to that. I have been on many search committees for faculty

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.360
 members through the course of my career, and I can testify to the

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.530
 fact that oftentimes when we get, you know, an application pools.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.700
 So these are all the people who have submitted applications for particular

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.870
 position. Usually we have a very small component of applications

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:37.040
 from minority status individuals. Um, honestly, the majority of

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.210
 our applications are from white men. Andan. The next biggest group is

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.380
 white women and eso. I do think that that's one of the issues is that

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.550
 we just aren't getting the same number of applications from minority

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.720
 professionals, and that may probably be because there just aren't

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.890
 as many minority professionals. So when you look at you know who

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.060
 is who, who is getting a PhD, there are fewer minority individuals getting

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.230
 PhDs compared to white individuals. Eso that's one part of the

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.410
 problem. The other problem is that I don't think we have taken a strong

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.580
 enough stance, uh, in terms of specifically hiring minority individuals.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.750
 Um, and I think that there are some politics that air revolving

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.920
 around that which aren't really necessary. But that has been

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.090
 a difficulty in our department. Um, you know, with issues being like,

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.260
 Well, is this the most qualified person? And it's like, Well, maybe

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.430
 not, because, honestly, we're just not getting the same pool of minority

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.600
 applicants. But representation is really important. We know this,

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.770
 and so is it worth it? Thio. Is it a better decision to hire a

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.940
 minority PhD who maybe doesn't have exactly the qualifications we're

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.110
 looking for, as opposed to hiring, You know, a white guy who does.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.280
 And I think you can make a really strong argument that no, it's better

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.450
 to hire the minority person because they're bringing something to

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.620
 the table that the other applicant absolutely cannot bring.
