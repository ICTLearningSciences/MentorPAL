00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.750
um, I think that one of the advantages of the especially the graduate

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.650
 training that I had so both of my masters and in my PhD, uh, one of

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.560
 the real basic skills that I learned that has been tremendously helpful

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.460
 to me in my career is learning how to work independently. Um, so

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.360
 getting, you know, learning how to set a schedule for myself, learning

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.260
 how to keep my self motivated, learning how Thio manage a lot of

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.160
 different projects at once. So it's not even, like just information

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.070
 that I got that has, I think, really helped me in my job. I mean, obviously

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.970
 the information that I learned in, you know, all of my schooling

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.870
 has contributed to my current success. Um, but I really think

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.770
 it's more of those, uh, individual. I like just learning how to think

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.680
 for yourself. Learning how thio manage your own self and toe work

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.580
 independently have been like those were the lessons that I really credit

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.480
 with my current success
