Well, I mean, you're a student. And so in that theoretical sense, yes,

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:12.200
 I do care about you because I care about students. That's part of my

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.880
 job. Do I care about you yourself? Personally? I don't know you. So

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.550
 that limits my ability to to really, personally care for you. But

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.230
 as a student, I absolutely care about you.
