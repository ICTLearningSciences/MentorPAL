00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.660
the best preparation that you can have for going to graduate school is

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.460
 having good communication skills. So being able to communicate really

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.270
 effectively both, uh, through writing and through speaking, so oral

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.070
 and written communication skills or key, Um, knowing kind of what

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.880
 you want out of graduate school, I think, is a really important component

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.680
 of success because if you have a good idea of what you want to

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.490
 get out of, graduate school is going to help you to pick the right

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.300
 program for you. Um, and having a good support network is really important

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.100
 to so, so kind of generating a support network, including, you

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.910
 know, some mentors that you could go to for advice on help along

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.710
 the way. All of those things can really increase your chances of success

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.520
 in graduate school, Yeah.
