00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.040
This is an interesting question because I personally feel that the way

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.230
 you should evaluate a graduate program is maybe slightly different

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.420
 than the way that you would evaluate an undergraduate program. So when

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.620
 you're going to an undergraduate program, you know, oftentimes there

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.810
 are some schools that kind of have a reputation, like, you know,

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.000
 Ivy League schools. You know, saying I went to Harvard may mean Mawr

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.190
 than saying I went thio you know, San Diego State. Um, but when you're

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.380
 in graduate school, it's so much more of a personalized experience.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.570
 And in my mind, what really matters is not so much the school that

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.760
 you went Thio, but who you worked with and what you did. Um, and

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.950
 the reason that I say this is that I know that the question that I

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.150
 get asked most frequently by professional people. So people who also,

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.340
 you know, have PhDs and or maybe in the research world, they don't

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.530
 say, Where did you go to graduate school? They say, Who did you work

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.720
 with in graduate school? That's what they want to know. It doesn't

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.910
 matter where I was. What they want to know is who I was working with.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:29.100
 And so I think that, you know, really, that's where you want to put

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.290
 your focus is you wanna work with somebody who has a good reputation,

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.480
 somebody who's sciences strong or whose work is well respected.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.680
 Um and I wouldn't worry is much about the actual context of where the

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.870
 work's occurring. So, you know, is that the University of Nebraska

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.060
 is that Yale that is less important compared to who are you actually

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.250
 working with?
