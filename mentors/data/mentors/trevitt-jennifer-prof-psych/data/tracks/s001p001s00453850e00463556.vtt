00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.040
I haven't thought too much about retirement. Um, one of the things I actually

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.230
 really like about my job is because it's not terribly physically

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.410
 demanding. It's one of those things that like, honestly, you can

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.600
 just keep doing it until I think of for for those of you who are Harry

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.790
 Potter fans, I think of Professor Bins, who's the ghost professor

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.980
 who, like died during a lecture. And he just kept going, Um, and

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.170
 that's why I sometimes think of myself as maybe a professor bins eventually,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.360
 that I'll just, you know, I'll die. But I'll just keep talking.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.540
 Um, I do sometimes think that I may want to retire possibly within,

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.730
 like, maybe the next 10 to 15 years. Um, but we'll see. We'll see

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.920
 if I actually do that.
