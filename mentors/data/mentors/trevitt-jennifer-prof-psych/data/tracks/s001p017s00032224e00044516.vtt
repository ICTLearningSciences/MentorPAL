00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.000
I think the way that I am able thio juggle kind of different roles, Multiple

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.140
 roles, maybe, just, you know, like being a teacher, being a researcher

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.290
 and being a parent, being a friend and all these different

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.430
 things is I don't do all of them simultaneously. I kind of do one for

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.580
 a little while. And then I switch hats, and then I do another one,

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.730
 and then I switch hats, and then I do another one. Um, and you know,

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.870
 some things in my life have had to adjust that way. So, like, for

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.020
 instance, with friendships, I found that the friendships in my life

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.160
 that are enduring are the ones with people who understand that, you

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.310
 know, I'm not always going to be in contact, like sometimes weeks.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.460
 They're gonna go by maybe even months, and you're not gonna hear from

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.600
 me, because I'm just I'm really busy. And I'm doing other things as

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.750
 soon as I can. I will pick up where we left off, Um, and fortunately,

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.890
 I found, you know, a few friends who are totally like that's how

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.040
 their lives are too. So we've kind of found each other, and we have

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.190
 a great friendship. But, you know, other other friendships haven't

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.330
 worked out because the other person wanted a little bit too much more

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.480
 from me than I could give, you know, in a go. So you know, some of

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.620
 its adjusting expectations and and some of it is just kind of being

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.770
 able to switch between things kind of rapidly, yeah.
