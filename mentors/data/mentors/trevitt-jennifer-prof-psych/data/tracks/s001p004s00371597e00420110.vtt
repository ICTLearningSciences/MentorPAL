00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.030
I actually did not choose this career, Really. I mean, I guess I did,

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.220
 But I was not looking for this career. I was working. So in 2000 and

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.400
 three, I was working in a research lab at U. C. I and I was a post

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.590
 doctoral students, so that meant that I had already got my PhD and I

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.770
 was doing research under the guidance of more senior researcher. And

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.960
 I had just gotten a grant from the National Institute of Health that

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.140
 would support my work for three years. So I, you know, I was very

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.320
 happy with the project that I was doing and, you know, was not looking

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.510
 for a job. And my old mentor, Dr Margaret White, who worked at Cal

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.690
 State Fullerton in the psychology department, and she taught the

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.880
 Biocyte classes, and I had just loved her classes. They really spoke

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.060
 to me amid the sea of all the other psychology classes, so I had actually

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.240
 developed a relationship with her. I served as her graduate assistant

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.430
 when I was in the Masters program at Cal State Fullerton before

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.610
 I went into my PhD program, and she had just remained a friend

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.800
 and a mentor throughout grad school on into my post, doc. And so she

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.980
 contacted me and told me that she was planning on retiring. She had

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.170
 made the decision to retire and that they were going Thio do a search

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.350
 to replace her, replace, find someone to replace her. And she wanted

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.530
 me to apply for the position. And I said, You know, I just got this

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.720
 grant. I'm really happy I'm in the middle of this big research program

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.900
 and I love what I'm doing. You know, I don't I don't want to

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.090
 apply for this job. And I didn't want to be a teacher. I wanted Thio

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.270
 be a researcher and go into industry. Um, and so being a teacher had

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.450
 really never been on my radar and she said, You know, that may be

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.640
 true right now, but it's always a good you know. This is good practice.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.820
 You, you know, it's it's a good idea to apply for jobs. Before you

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.010
 know you're really wanting to find a job. Consider a practice. Go

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.190
 in. Just get your resume together, get all your stuff together again.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.380
 This is good practice to get all these documents together. now and

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.560
 just go and apply. And so I did, and they called me back and I had

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.740
 a phone interview, and then they asked me to come in an interview,

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.930
 and I went in and I gave a lecture and the talk, Um, and I ended up

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.110
 getting hired. And that, I guess, is when I chose because I was like,

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.300
 Well, I can stay here at U C. I doing the research that I'm doing

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.480
 and really enjoying Or, you know, I've been offered this job at Cal

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.660
 State Fullerton and, you know, honestly, I don't even know what it was

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.850
 that made me take the job. I mean, I really loved Cal State Fullerton.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.030
 I had gone there as a student and, you know, really had a fondness

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.220
 for the department. And I think, part of what made me go what made

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.400
 me choose it at that particular moment in time was that when I was

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.590
 a student at Cal State Fullerton, nobody was doing the kind of research

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.770
 that I wanted to do. Nobody was doing this kind of more biologically

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.950
 based research, and it was very frustrating for me because,

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.140
 you know, I wanted to do research, but I didn't really want to Do, you

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.320
 know, I didn't want to do a research project that I wasn't super

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.510
 interested in. Um and so I really That was kind of what What made me

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.690
 take the job is that I thought, you know what? I can make it kind of

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.870
 my goal to bring this kind of research to this department so that

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.060
 if there are other students like me who want to learn more about this

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.240
 and actually want some hands on experience, well, at least they will

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.430
 have, you know, some kind of opportunity. It may not be exactly what

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.610
 they want to do, but it will be closer than you know, what's what's

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.800
 on offer right now. And I think that that's really what motivated

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.980
 my decision ultimately to take the job.
