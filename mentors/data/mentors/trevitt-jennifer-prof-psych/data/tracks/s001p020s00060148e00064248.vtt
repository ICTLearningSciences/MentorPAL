00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.410
choosing a major is an important decision, and I think that one of the

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.960
 biggest factors you need to consider is your own personal enjoyment

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.520
 of this major school is really hard. And if you don't enjoy what you're

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.070
 doing and you're not excited to be learning the things that you're

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.630
 learning, it's really, really tough to stay motivated and see it

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.180
 through to the end. So I would definitely look at all of the available

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.740
 majors and choose one that really speaks to you. If you're not sure,

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.290
 you can always take an introductory class in that field and see

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.850
 if this is something that you like.
