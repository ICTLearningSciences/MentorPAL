00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.100
Well, generally you're going if you're talking about, like, career type

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.360
 jobs, Um, generally, you're going to be looking to start a job like

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.610
 maybe after you finish your bachelor's degree. So you should start

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.870
 looking for those jobs at least a couple of months in advance, if not

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:27.120
 a little bit sooner than that. Um, oftentimes, especially in businesses.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.380
 You know, once they've made the decision to hire you, they want

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.630
 you to start fairly quickly. So you don't want to start too far

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.890
 in advance because you don't want to get a position and then say, Oh,

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.140
 yeah. And by the way, I can't start working until June. Um, so you

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.400
 know, if, like, let's say that you're graduating in May of 2021 I would

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.650
 probably start looking for jobs in December, January time. I would

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.910
 start applying for jobs, maybe in March or April, somewhere around

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.160
 there, but probably not much sooner than that
