00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.010
Well, the first thing you want to do is you want to find out what g p

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.170
 a like What's the minimum G p A. That you need for the programs to what

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.330
 you want to apply. So most programs have a minimum. G p a on, but

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.480
 it may be something like 3.6. And so what that essentially means is

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.640
 that if you're G p A isn't 3.6, don't bother applying. Now they say

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.800
 that, but that's not necessarily true. So if your G p. A. Is less

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.960
 than whatever it is the school's you're applying to want, you have a

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.120
 couple of options. Um, if your GP is pretty close. So let's say the

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.280
 minimum G p A is 3.6, you have a 3.5. You might want to just take a

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.430
 few more classes and get a few mores and raise your G p A. That way.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.590
 Um, I would only recommend that strategy if your overall G p. A. Is

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.750
 really, really close to whatever the cut office. Um, if it's farther

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.910
 from the cut off, then one of the things that you can do is you can

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.070
 take a look at your own transcripts and see, you know, why is your

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.230
 g p l o? Oftentimes the story is that, you know, sometimes usually

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.380
 it's early on in college, you know, maybe the second or third, or even

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.540
 first semester When you know people are still adjusting to being

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.700
 college students. They have a semester to where they don't do great

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.860
 in some classes, and so they may have some CS or DS. Or, you know,

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.020
 even if, um and those air really dragging down their overall G p A.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.180
 Even if they recovered. And if you look at you know, the past couple

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.330
 of years, they've got nothing but straight A's. Those early bad grades

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.490
 are going to kind of drive down their overall G p A. Because it's

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.650
 a mean, um, so one of the things if that's the case that your in your

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.810
 overall GP is low. But maybe like your last, your most recent work

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.970
 is really, really good. Um, you can address that and most of the

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.130
 time on your transcript, for instance, it will calculate your overall

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.280
 G p A. But it will also just calculate your GP within your major so

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.440
 if your GP within your major is really high, then in that case, I

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.600
 would address that in your personal statement and say something like,

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.760
 You know, even though my overall GP is low, if you look at my transcripts,

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.920
 you can see that it was due to this, you know, one semester.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.080
 And this is what was going on. You know, maybe there's a reason it

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.240
 was low that semester. Um, you know, But in the last two years, you

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.390
 can see that I've got a 4.0, average you know, in my major. And so

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.550
 that's kind of a sign that you've grown in the last couple of years.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.710
 You've matured into a really good student. Another thing that you can

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.870
 dio is you can see if you can make a personal connection at this

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.030
 program. So this is where you're going to talk to your mentors. Um,

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.190
 talk to other people in your network and see if anybody knows anybody

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.340
 you know, at the program toe what you want to apply that you could

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.500
 maybe have a conversation with and say, Hey, you know, I'm really interested

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.660
 in your program. Here's my problem, you know, and Maybe they

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.820
 might have some advice for you. Or maybe they'll just say, you know,

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.980
 we'll keep an eye out from your application or something like that.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.140
 Um, you may also wanna have your letter writers directly address

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.290
 this in their letters, so make them aware of this issue. I'm applying

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.450
 to a school, my overall GPS and high enough. But, you know, here's

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.610
 my GP for the last two years. It's much better. Could you specifically

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.770
 talk about this in my letter and say, You know what a good student

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.930
 I am and that kind of stuff and most letter writers, I mean, we

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.090
 want to write letters that are going to help you succeed. And so that

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.240
 information is totally fine to give to give to your letter writers.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.400
 So, you know, those were some of your options. If your G p A is a

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.560
 little bit lower, then you know what you want it to be for. For applying

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.720
 Thio graduate schools
