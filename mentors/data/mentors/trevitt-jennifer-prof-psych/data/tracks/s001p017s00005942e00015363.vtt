00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.370
planning a study takes a lot of time. Generally, you kind of start with

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.880
 a question that you have, like, you know. So my my kind of overarching

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.400
 question is how does what we eat effect, how we feel and how we

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.920
 learn. And then I take that question and I kind of try to break it

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.440
 down into smaller and smaller parts. Um, with studies, one of the things

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.950
 you want to be careful about is not making them too complex. So

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.470
 I That's one of the reasons I use animals, for instance, because I

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.990
 can control a lot of factors that I would not be able to control with

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.510
 humans. Um, like genetics, for instance. Um and then I break it down

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.020
 so that I'm just looking at, like, I'm not looking at every possible

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.540
 diet. I'm looking specifically at one versus, like, a controlled

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.060
 diet. And so that's kind of how you plan studies
