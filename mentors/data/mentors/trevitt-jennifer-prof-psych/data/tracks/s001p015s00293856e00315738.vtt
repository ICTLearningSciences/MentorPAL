00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.190
there are actually quite a few programs available on campus for students,

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.530
 particularly those students who want to go on to graduate school,

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.870
 um in, for instance, research. So so for students who are interested

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:22.210
 in in research careers, there's a program called Maximizing Access

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.540
 to Research Careers or Mark for Short, um, that pairs students with

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.880
 mentors, faculty mentors and the students do research in the faculty

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.220
 mentors like under their supervision. Uh, they present projects.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.560
 They go to conferences, they get help with grad school applications.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.900
 Um, uh, G R E prep. Like all sorts of things, it's a great program.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.240
 Um, students are actually paid to be in the program. So if you're admitted

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.580
 to the program, you do get a stipend as a student for doing

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.920
 that, and you get funds for the to support the research that you're

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.260
 doing. Um, there are is the McNair scholars, which is available thio

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.590
 students from a certain minority groups. Um, and that again is a mentor

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.930
 intensive program. So you're paired with a mentor. You get a lot

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.270
 of help with things like writing and time management, um, and resume

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.610
 prep and um, applications to grad school and things like that. Um,

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.950
 there are a whole bunch of programs. Sally Casanova, scholarships

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.290
 for students. Um, going into the biomedical fields. There are a lot

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.630
 of little like niche programs. So again, one of the places that I would

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.970
 recommend you go is the office of, like, Financial aid, um, or to

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.300
 the psychology department, um, they or even the career center. They

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.640
 should have information about all of the different kind of specialty

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.980
 programs on campus that air there to serve different groups of students

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:14.320
 based on either their backgrounds or based on their interests.
