00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.810
I think my hardest experience in this field were there is to actually

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.770
 So So the first was graduate school. Graduate school was just really,

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.730
 really tough. It was long and it was very stressful and very demanding,

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.690
 and that that was a hard experience. But I you know, I learned

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.650
 a lot and got me to where I am today. The other hardest experience

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.610
 for me personally was going back to work after my kids were born. Um,

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.570
 not because I didn't want to. I really did want to go back to work.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.520
 Actually, I was very, very ready. Thio resume my career, but it was

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.480
 just It was really tough. Thio figure out how to manage, You know,

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.440
 this this very involved career that I had, that I was very committed

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.400
 Thio. And then, you know, all of these kids all of a sudden and and

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.360
 having to manage that, so that was really tough. Um, but again, you

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.320
 know, I think that all in all, I learned a lot and I'm better for

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.280
 the experience
