00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.010
okay. Setbacks could be really frustrating. Um, I think that as a researcher

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:11.170
 and having been a researcher for almost 30 years now, I have

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.340
 learned that this is just par for the course. There's always gonna be

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.500
 setbacks. You're always gonna have to go back to the beginning or

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.660
 at least close to the beginning or re think and re approach. Um, And

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.820
 so I guess what I've learned from the work that I've done up to this

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.980
 point is that setbacks are temporary. Um, you just have toe, you know,

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.140
 keep going. And eventually you will either get to where you wanna

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.310
 be or the place where you wanna be. That goal is going to change,

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.470
 and so just, you know, just keeps women, and eventually you'll get

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.630
 to where you want to go.
