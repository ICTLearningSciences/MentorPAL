00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.980
Well, I guess there are a lot of different ways you gonna answer this

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.120
 question? Um, on the face of it, I think you could argue that it's incredibly

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.250
 diverse because psychology is the study of people, you know.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.380
 And we, you know, there are a lot of different types of people, and

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.520
 psychology is in the business of studying them all. Um, I think that

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.650
 in terms of the practice of psychology, um, and the profession of

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.780
 psychology, I think that we still have a long way to go in terms of

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.920
 diversity. Andi, I think that it's really important that we make that

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.050
 a priority. Um, because if we're looking at, you know, studying

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.180
 people, we need to make sure we're studying all different types of people

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.320
 on different types of cultures and how they navigate within those

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.450
 cultures. And and so I think that the field as a whole definitely

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.580
 has a long way to go. But I do think that there are concerted efforts

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.720
 being made. Thio have mawr diversity within the field of psychology
