00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.250
uh, that's a hard one. When you don't get into the program you want. Yeah,

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.650
 I think your best course of action is going to depend on a couple

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.040
 of things. Number one. Did you get into a different program? Maybe

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.440
 one that you didn't like as well. Um, if you did get into another

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.840
 program, let's say you got you didn't get your first or even your second

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.240
 choice. But maybe you got into your third choice program. You know,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.630
 at that point, you know that the whole application process takes,

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.030
 you know, that's an effortful process. Um, and it may be that the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.430
 third choice program is honestly good enough, you know? And if that's

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.830
 the case, then I would just go with the third choice and never look

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.230
 back. Um, if you didn't get into your first choice, you know, the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.620
 one you were really hoping for and you didn't get into any other programs

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.020
 or you know, you on, Lee got into, like, maybe the safety schools

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.420
 that you really are not interested in going to. Um I would say

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.820
 at that point maybe find out why you weren't admitted. Sometimes it

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.210
 has nothing to do with you. Sometimes it has to do with funding. You

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.610
 know, the person that you wanted to work with just doesn't have the

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.010
 grant money to pay for another graduate student. Or, you know, the

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.410
 department just doesn't have money for more students or whatever. Um,

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.800
 so you know, if you can find out why you didn't get in and then if

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.200
 it's a weakness in your application, then take some time and address

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.600
 that and hit him up again. Mhm.
