The easiest way to develop a positive relationship with one of your professors

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.490
 is to actually go to their office hours and meet them and get

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.320
 to know them. Um, it helps if you have some targeted questions. Um,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.140
 usually, professors don't have a ton of time for just kind of like

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.960
 open ended conversations. But you can absolutely ask them things like

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.780
 How did they get to where they are? Where did they go to school?

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.610
 How did they choose? Psychology is, of course, of study eso getting

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.430
 to know your professors really just starts with meeting with them.
