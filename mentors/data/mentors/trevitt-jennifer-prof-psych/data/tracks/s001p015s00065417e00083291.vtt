00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.790
it can be fairly competitive to get into graduate school. I mean, the

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.720
 general state of affairs is that there are more people who want to get

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.660
 into graduate school than there are positions in graduate school.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.600
 Now, that is not always the case, but that is usually the case. The

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.530
 Mawr desirable the program or the mentor is the harder it's going to

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.470
 be to get in, the more competition there is going to be, um, so, you

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.410
 know, if you're feeling like maybe you don't have a really high G

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.350
 p A. Maybe you don't have a lot of experience. Maybe you don't have

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.280
 the greatest scores on the G r. E. Um, you know, one of the things

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.220
 that you can do is you can look into less sought after programs. So,

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.160
 you know, honestly programs that Aaron places where, you know, not

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.090
 everybody wants to live. Sometimes they're a little bit easier to get

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.030
 into than programs in like New York City or in Los Angeles, because

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.970
 a lot of people want to be there. Um, so you know, that might help

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.900
 you in terms of like the number of applications, but you can. Usually,

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.840
 they usually keep those stats so you can assess that. Like how much

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.780
 competition you're gonna have. Um, most programs do have data on

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.720
 you know how many applications they get every year versus how Maney

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.650
 positions they award every year. And so you can kind of get a feel

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.590
 for how competitive a particular program is going to be.
