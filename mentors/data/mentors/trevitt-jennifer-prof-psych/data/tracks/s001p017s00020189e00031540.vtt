00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.440
balancing work and family is in some ways, I think, kind of a myth. It's

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.040
 not that you are doing both equally at all times. I think rather

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.630
 instead, sometimes you're doing more work related stuff, and sometimes

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.230
 you're doing more family related stuff. Um, I will say that the whole

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.820
 process has gotten a lot easier is my kids have gotten older? Um,

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.420
 but generally I would say it just kind of goes in season Sometimes,

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.010
 you know, some days are much more work intensive and less family

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.610
 intensive, and other days are more family intensive. One of the things

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.200
 that I will say that I think I truly believe has helped me is I made

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.790
 a very good choice in partner. So my husband, Brian, is a wonderful

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.390
 parent, and he's a great partner to me. We both have careers that

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.980
 we really enjoy, and we both really like our family. Um, but we split

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.580
 our responsibilities both to our own careers and to our joint family,

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.170
 um, pretty evenly, and I think that that's a real key factor in

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.770
 in my personal success in being able to kind of do that pretty pretty

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.360
 well
