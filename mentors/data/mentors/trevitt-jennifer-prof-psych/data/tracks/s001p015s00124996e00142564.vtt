00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.170
I would say it's pretty difficult. Um, graduate school is unlike undergraduate

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.480
 in that it's really not meant to be a part time thing. Most

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.800
 graduate programs, both at the Masters level and at the PhD level,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.110
 are designed to be full time programs. And so that's kind of the expectation

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.430
 is that you are a full time student, Um, and that's reflected

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.740
 in things like coursework in hours that you need to put in for various

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:38.060
 you know, internships and things like that, or or research projects,

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.370
 Um, and so holding a job particularly a full time job while being

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.690
 a full time graduate student, um, can be really difficulty. Now

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.010
 there are some programs. There are some graduate programs that are

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.320
 especially designed for, for instance, like working professionals Onda.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.640
 Those tend Teoh be a little bit more flexible. And although they

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.950
 may take, you know mawr like it might take you longer in terms of maybe

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.270
 like years to get out of them in terms of like hours per day. Your

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.580
 it's less and so that's why it takes longer is because its's like

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.900
 you're going, you know, part time as opposed to going full time. Um

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.210
 But in general, no, I mean, in general, if you're a graduate student,

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.530
 that is your full time job is being a graduate student.
