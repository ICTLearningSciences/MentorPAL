00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.670
Well, I think if you're referring Thio the folks with PhDs, for instance.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.500
 So these air oftentimes, you know, the clinical psychologist or

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.320
 the people who are in academic positions. Um, so, you know, maybe not

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.150
 even just PhDs. But like people who have graduate degrees in psychology,

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.970
 Um, I think you're generally looking at people who are coming

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.790
 from, you know, a fairly wealthy, you know, socioeconomic status group.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.620
 Andi and I don't think that that's unique to psychology. I think

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.440
 that that's true of all fields that e mean, just demographic information

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.260
 or data shows that the higher the level of education generally

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.090
 you're looking at, ah, higher socioeconomic status background. So

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.910
 So I think that that's just kind of typical of the educational process

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.740
 as opposed to a particular field. Um, Other than that, I really don't

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.560
 feel like I'm qualified to speak to this. Uh, I think that there

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.380
 is diversity there. Certainly people who, uh, have come from, you

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.210
 know, not wealthy socioeconomic status backgrounds. Um, but I would

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.030
 I would be surprised if the majority did not
