00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.340
I think the culture that I most identify with is white, upper middle class

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:13.820
 American. I don't even know if an American is a culture, but I

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:20.310
 think it might be, um I definitely grew up, I would say, surrounded

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.790
 mostly by white people until I moved to Hawaii, and then it was very

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:33.280
 different. Um, in Hawaii, the I don't know what culture actually dominates

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.760
 because there are a lot of different, um, Asian cultures that

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.250
 are their own unique cultures. So collectively, I guess they dominate

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.730
 numbers wise, but they're not a single entity. So So it z not that,

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.220
 but white people are not the majority. I could definitely I can

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.710
 say that. Um, so that was very different on drily. Awesome, too, because

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:12.190
 it just, you know, show me a different perspective on life that

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:18.680
 there are a lot of different ways to be their different family structures.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:25.160
 They're different foods, They're different traditions and customs.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:31.650
 And I think that that z one of my favorite things, actually about

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:38.130
 growing up in Hawaii, Um, I think that my culture in California

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.620
 when I was a kid was much more homogenized. Um, and it was very much

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:51.100
 like, yeah, white, middle to upper middle class, professional, you

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.590
 know. But that's about it, So yeah,
