00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.000
So when I graduated with my bachelor's degree, I went into a master's

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.150
 program. So I went into graduate school from There s Oh, I didn't I

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.290
 wasn't really on the job market at that point on Ben. When I was during

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.440
 my Masters program, I decided to then go on for a PhD. And so again,

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.590
 I kind of went into my PhD program and it wasn't really a job search

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.740
 so much. Um, my first probably riel job search was when I finished

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.880
 with my PhD and I was looking for a postdoctoral position. Um,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.030
 and in that case I actually found my my postdoctoral position through

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.180
 a contact of my my mentors. So So, the person that I ended up working

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.330
 within my post doctoral position was a colleague of my mentors,

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.480
 and my mentor introduced us and, you know, recommended me thio the position.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.620
 And so then we met and, you know, hit it off. And so then he

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.770
 offered me the job that way. Eso So that was pretty much that's how

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.920
 I found that position
