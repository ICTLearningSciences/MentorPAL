00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.390
you don't have to take advanced statistics, but I'll tell you this statistics

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.920
 and statistical abilities is actually one of the best things

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.460
 that you can get out of being a psych major. Um, particularly in my

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.990
 department, we have a lot of great statistics. Classes that are offered

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.530
 in statistics is kind of a concentration that students can focus

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.070
 on within our departmental offerings, and this is one of those things

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.600
 that is going to translate most readily into a marketable skill.
