00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.280
So I got started in psychology. I guess in general, when I went to college

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.720
 because I went to San Diego State University and as an incoming

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.150
 freshman, you had to pick a major. At that point on dso I just ended

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.580
 up picking psychology because I knew it. And I, you know, was I thought

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.010
 it was kind of interesting, I guess. And so I thought, Okay, I'll

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.450
 pick. That is a major and then I just kind of ended up sticking

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.880
 with it.
