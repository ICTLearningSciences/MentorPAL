00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:08.340
I can't recall a deliberate time when I have been treated unfairly at

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.820
 work. However, I do think that there have been some instances in which

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:23.310
 assumptions were made based primarily on my gender, that we're not

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.800
 really equal. So So assumptions were made about me And what I would

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:38.290
 be willing to dio, um that were different from the assumptions that

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:45.770
 were made about my male colleagues. Um, and that was that's been annoying.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:53.260
 But honestly, I think really in the psychology department were

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:00.750
 pretty aware of those types of biases. And I think that our faculty

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:08.240
 is really committed. Thio, um you know, equality, gender equality,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:15.720
 ethnic equality and and so I think that we're pretty good about policing

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.210
 ourselves in that way. I mean, I have experienced, like, some

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:30.700
 offhand comments, Um, sometimes that I'm just, like, really, really

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:38.190
 um, but nothing really aggressive and nothing where I would feel like

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:45.670
 my career was being unfairly disadvantaged. Um, I think I felt really

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:53.160
 fortunate to be honest. Um, in the psychology department, I think

00:01:53.160 --> 00:02:00.650
 it's a pretty egalitarian department
