00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.090
So graduate school is, I would say, more specialized than college college.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.320
 Even within a major, you're still kind of doing a broader course

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.560
 of study In graduate school, you're really dialing down into a very

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.800
 specific area. Um, graduate school is also much more independent than,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.040
 um, when you're doing, like your bachelor's degree, um, you're

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.270
 expected to really function much more independently. Um, you're actually

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.510
 trying to become somebody who could then, uh, mentor other students,

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.750
 for instance. So instead of being mentored, I mean, you'll be

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.980
 mentor during graduate school, but the ultimate goal is for you to kind

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.220
 of get to the place where your mentor is at.
