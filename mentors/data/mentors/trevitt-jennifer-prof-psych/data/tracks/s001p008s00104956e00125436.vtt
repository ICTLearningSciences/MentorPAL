00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.840
um I think early in my life, e I was very afraid of failure. You know,

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.830
 failure meant that I wasn't doing what I was supposed to dio, um, I

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.830
 wasn't good enough. I wasn't smart enough. I wasn't working hard enough.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.820
 Whatever you wanna call it. Um, as I've gone through my career

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.810
 and especially as I've become uneducated Er, um, and a parent, I should

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.800
 also add I have come to view failure as a process. Failure is what

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.790
 you do before you succeed, right? So you just fail and fail and

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.790
 fail and fail and fail, and then you succeed. And so failure to me at

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.780
 this point does not mean, you know, doing something and having it

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.770
 not work out the way that I wanted Thio failure to me means I'm not

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.760
 trying to do something I'm giving up before I even begin. Um and so,

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.750
 you know, I think that having things not work out having expectations

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.750
 that aren't met. Um, not doing well, all of those things are ways

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.740
 that we can adjust our behaviors. We can either. Just our expectations.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.730
 We can adjust our behaviors, weaken, say, like, Oh, maybe this

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.720
 is just how it works out, Um, or we could just try something new. This

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.710
 is just part of the process. And so I think that I don't look at

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.710
 failure. Like when something doesn't work out for me, I don't think

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.700
 Oh, that was a failure, I think. Oh, that didn't work. Okay, well, let's

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.690
 let's think about why it didn't work and let's regroup And let's

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.680
 do this again and that might that process might have to have to happen

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.670
 20 times before, you know, I get a result that I'm like, Okay,

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.670
 this worked eso That's how I look at failure now. Failure means that

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.660
 I'm not trying. I'm not even beginning the process. That's what failure

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.650
 is to me now.
