00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.640
well, the main different degrees. Or you could get a master's degree and

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.440
 a PhD or, like maybe another type of doctoral degree. So so that's

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.230
 kind of the two categories is a master's degree and a doctoral degree.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.020
 So masters are usually either a master of arts degree or a master

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.820
 of science degree, depending on what course of study you're doing.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.610
 And then there are multiple types of doctoral degrees so you can get

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.410
 a PhD, which is technically a doctorate in philosophy. Um, but that's

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.200
 really to distinguish it from an M D, which is a doctor of medicine.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.990
 Uh, you can get a J D, which is a doctor of jurisprudence, um,

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.790
 an E D, which is a doctor of education, so there's a lot of different

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.580
 flavors of doctoral degrees.
