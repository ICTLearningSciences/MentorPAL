00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.020
I've had a lot of role models. Um, my grandmother, when I was much younger,

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.200
 was a powerful role model for me. She was very smart woman, very

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.370
 interested in a lot of things. Um, like botany and arts and crafts

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.550
 and making things and cooking. Um I mean, there, you know, name a

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.720
 craft. She did it and she taught me how to do all of them. And so I

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.890
 really learned how Thio make a lot of things. And I think that the overall

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.070
 thing that that did for me is it kind of taught me that, like,

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.240
 I could do a lot of stuff. I could make a lot of stuff so often times,

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.420
 you know, when I'm out and about in the world shopping or something,

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.590
 and I'll see something and I'll be like, Oh, that's really cool.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.770
 And then my second thought will be like, I could make that Andi.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.940
 I think that that really came from her influence, that that kind of

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.110
 ability or confidence in my own abilities Thio make something. Um and

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.290
 then my mom has been a really strong role model for me. Um, in that

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.460
 she is a very independent woman. I think for her she was a little

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.640
 ahead of her time. She came from kind of a more conservative family

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.810
 with more conservative gender roles, which she pretty much defied her

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.980
 whole life and in some ways paid the price for that. Um, but she's

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.160
 always just lived really true to herself. And, um, that has been important

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.330
 for me in my own life, to kind of have that influence to see

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.510
 like, yeah, you just you need toe make your rules. And the rules you

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.680
 follow are the ones that make sense to you. You don't just, you know,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.850
 let other people, for instance, do your thinking for you. You you

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.030
 think things out for yourself. Um and then my stepmother has been

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.200
 amazing role model to me. She had had a pretty high powered career in

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.380
 in health care while she was also raising my younger brothers and,

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.550
 you know, watching her kind of achieve that balance, or at least a

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.730
 semblance of that balance. But, you know, between having a career that

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.900
 she was just really passionate about and really loved, and then also

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.070
 having a family, that she was very devoted thio, um and seeing you

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.250
 know how she kind of managed that, um was really, really important

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.420
 for me and especially once I became a parent, I relied on her wisdom

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.600
 and advice on how to kind of manage both of these really important

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.770
 parts of my life.
