00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.200
time management, I think, is one of the biggest keys to success, probably

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.550
 for any professional person, but particularly if you are wearing

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.890
 multiple hats either within your profession or you have other important

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.240
 elements of your life outside of your career. Time management is

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.590
 key, and so the way that I do it is I just I have a schedule. I write

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.940
 a schedule down and it's it's not set in stone. It's written in

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.290
 sand. Um, but I kind of always have an outline of you know how. Ideally,

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.630
 I would like Thio put my time throughout, You know, the day or

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.980
 the week or the month, Um, and every once in a while I'll sit down and

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.330
 kind of re adjust as things in my life change. So I don't have the

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.680
 same schedule all the time. I have a schedule for when I'm teaching

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.030
 and the schedule for when I'm not teaching, um, and things like that.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.370
 But I I literally have a schedule, and the first thing I do when

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.720
 I wake up in the morning is I look at my schedule on the last thing

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.070
 I do before I go to bed at night is I look at my schedule
