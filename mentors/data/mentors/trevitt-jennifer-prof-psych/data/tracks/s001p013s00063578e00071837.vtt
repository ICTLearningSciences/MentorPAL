okay. Most students take their internship class the year that they're

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.310
 going to graduate sometime in their Andi. I think the reason for that

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.050
 is that internship is something that you don't want to jump into right

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.780
 away. Just because you may not know what you really want to dio

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.510
 it's You know, I would take some time to figure out what you really

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.240
 think you want to do and then use your internship as a way to kind

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.980
 of get your feet wet in that area. Um, but you can take your internship

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.710
 earlier than that. Eso I would say any time after you have junior

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.440
 standing is, um find Thio. Take your internship.
