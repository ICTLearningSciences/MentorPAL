00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.870
I actually started my college career at San Diego State University, which

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.880
 is part of the CSU system. Um, but it's obviously in San Diego and

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.900
 I went there because my dad and my step mom lived in Orange County

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.910
 and I did not want to live at home. And so I literally took a compass

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.930
 and a map and I drew a circle around where my dad lived and any

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.940
 school that fell into that circle I did not apply to because I didn't

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.960
 want to be close enough so that, theoretically, I could live at home.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.970
 So I ended up going toe San Diego State. For that reason, they were

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.990
 far enough away that I couldn't really live at home and commute.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:01.000
 But at the same time, I was close enough so I could go and do laundry

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.020
 if I needed to you. So I was close enough to my family, and I like

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.030
 that Onda. That's really what started me at San Diego State, say the

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.050
 ego state. However, at the time Waas really over enrolled eso. They

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:25.070
 had way too many students and it was very hard to get classes there

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.080
 and so I was there for two years. I think it was two years and realized

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.100
 that at the rate that I was going, it was going to take me another

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.110
 at least 3 to 4 years to get all of the classes that I needed

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.130
 to graduate. And I didn't want to be in college for that long. On dso

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.140
 I made the decision that I really needed Thio choose a different school.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.160
 Um, now I wanted the work that I had done to follow me, and so

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.170
 I thought that my best bet for that would be to stay in the CSU system.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.190
 And so I looked at the different CSU campuses, and Fullerton had

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.200
 a good psych department and they had, you know, a lot of really cool

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.220
 things going on. And I at that point I kind of knew that I did want

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.230
 to be a psych major. Um and so I chose Fullerton for that reason,

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.250
 and that's how I ended up there
