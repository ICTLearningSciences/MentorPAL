Okay, Well, I don't think there's anything special or magical about psychology

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.160
 courses as opposed to other types. Of course, is usually the

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.820
 way that you do well, is that you make sure that you have enough time

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.470
 to devote to the class so that you have enough time to study the

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.130
 material. Um, if you are having problems understanding something, or

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.790
 you just want to go over it again, take advantage of your professor's

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.440
 office hours. All professors are required to have office hours,

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.100
 so take advantage of those, um, personally, I think forming study groups

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.760
 is a really helpful technique, but that's not necessarily true

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.410
 for everybody. But if it is true for you, then you know, take the lead

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.070
 and ask some fellow students if they want to form a study group that

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.720
 could be really, really helpful and increase your chances of success
