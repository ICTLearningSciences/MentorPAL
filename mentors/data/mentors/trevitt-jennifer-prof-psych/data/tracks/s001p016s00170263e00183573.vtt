00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.280
generally to apply for graduate school, you're going to need to fill out

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.720
 an application form. Um, sometimes their general application forms

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.150
 that you fill out, and then you can send them to multiple schools.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.580
 Sometimes schools have their own individual application form that you

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.020
 have to fill out just for them. Eso You can usually learn more about

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.450
 that on the school's website. They'll tell you exactly what you

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.880
 what form you need to fill out. You'll also need usually letters of

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.320
 recommendation at least 2 to 3. And so these air letters written by

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.750
 mentors people that you've worked with like former employers. Things

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.180
 like that. You know, they can be former professors, but you generally

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.620
 only want toe. Ask a professor if you have a close relationship with,

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.050
 um um, and then you'll need a statement of purpose. Often times,

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.480
 which is a brief essay, usually just a couple of pages, um, talking

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.920
 about you know why you want to go to grad school, why you want to

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.350
 go to this particular program on DSA? Mother details. Oftentimes again,

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.780
 the school's website will have guidance in terms of what they want

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.220
 you to cover in your personal statement on beer. Maybe a few other

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.650
 things that you need depending on the school that you're applying

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.080
 to. But those were the General three. That you'll probably need for

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.520
 all schools is the application, the letters of recommendation and the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.950
 personal statement.
