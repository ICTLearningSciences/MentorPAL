00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.580
I think my best advice for job searching like kind of beginning a job

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.320
 search is to try to be, you know, try to narrow down what you really

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.050
 want to dio Um but keep your options open, and so I wouldn't turn down

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.790
 a job that looked pretty good, but maybe didn't have some of your

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.520
 requirements. So you don't want to narrow it down so much that you

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.250
 know, there's essentially, like, Onley five positions in the entire

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.990
 universe. Um, you know, you want to narrow enough to kind of weed through

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.720
 things that you know you absolutely don't want. Um but then you

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.460
 want to keep it loose enough so that you don't miss opportunities,

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.190
 because sometimes a job may look, you know, kind of one way on paper,

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.920
 But then, in reality, it ends up, you know, really being close to

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.660
 what you want to dio or, you know, it might even turn you in a slightly

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.390
 different direction. So especially when you're new thio working

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.130
 professionally, Um, um, I would err on the side of staying open as

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.860
 opposed Thio saying No, this isn't what I'm looking for.
