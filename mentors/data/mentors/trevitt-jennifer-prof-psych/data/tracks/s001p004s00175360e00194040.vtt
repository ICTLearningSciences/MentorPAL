00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.470
I think the better question here is what other majors did I not consider?

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.090
 I switched my major so many times during my college grow and not

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.710
 officially so I didn't officially ever filed paperwork to switch my

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.330
 major, But in my in my mind, I switched my major. I'm going to say

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.960
 at least twice a semester for the first 2 to 3 years. And what determined

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.580
 this was was really the professors that taught the classes that

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.200
 I took. So when I took a class with a great professor and they brought

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.820
 all of their passion into the classroom, it was infectious. And

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.440
 I caught the bug like every time. And so if you look at my my career

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.060
 or my major over the first three years of my college education, you

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.680
 know, I started with psychology, but other ones that I considered

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.300
 or you know, kind of switched to were geology Anthropologie, uh, foreign

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.920
 language. I was gonna be a translator for the u. N. I still think

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.540
 that would have been a good, good career choice. But anyways, um

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.170
 history English, I think that might have been it. There might have been

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.790
 a few more in there. Um, really. I changed my mind all the time.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.410
 I was just kind of, you know, whatever got me excited. I was like,

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:42.030
 This is what I'm doing. Everything else is dead to me. I'm doing this

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.650
 now, so I changed my major quite a bit.
