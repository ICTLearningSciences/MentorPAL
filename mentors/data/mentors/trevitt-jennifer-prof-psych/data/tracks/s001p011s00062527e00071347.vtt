00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.210
so many people inspire me. My friends inspire me. My husband inspires

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.560
 me. My kids inspire me. My colleagues inspire me. Um, I guess when people

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.920
 ask this question, they're usually asking, like, maybe about,

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.270
 like, historical figures. Um, So Eleanor Roosevelt is one of, like,

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.630
 I find her very inspiring. Um, in terms of more kind of recent people

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.980
 are currently living people, um, Glenn and Oil Mountain is someone

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.340
 who inspires me and burn a brown. Um, they both do a lot of work about

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.690
 living authentically, and I just I'm always blown away by what they

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.050
 have to say, but just a lot of people inspire me.
