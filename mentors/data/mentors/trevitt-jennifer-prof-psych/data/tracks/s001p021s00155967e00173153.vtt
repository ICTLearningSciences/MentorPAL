00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.950
that's a really hard position to be in. Um, my first impulse would be

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.060
 Thio advise you to speak to the professor directly and to tell them

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:16.160
 that, you know, give them an example of something that made you feel

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.260
 uncomfortable. That's that's occurred. Um, but I understand also that

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.370
 students really may not feel comfortable doing that. And in that

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.470
 case, I would advise you to go to the to the chair of the department

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.570
 or to the dean of the college, or to the dean of students, and share

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.680
 your feelings with them and if possible, if you can. If you can have

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.780
 concrete examples of you know what has occurred that has made, you

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.880
 know, maybe things the professor said or things that the professor

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.990
 did that made you feel discriminated against or made you feel uncomfortable.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:02.090
 That could be really helpful. So, um, you know, because of

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.190
 the imbalance in the power dynamic between professors and students,

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.300
 I can very much understand that a student may not want Thio directly

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.400
 speak to a professor if they're feeling already that this professor

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.500
 is discriminating against them. But, um, you do have rights as a student

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.610
 and s O. I would. I would definitely go to the chair of the department

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.710
 or to the dean or to the dean of students.
