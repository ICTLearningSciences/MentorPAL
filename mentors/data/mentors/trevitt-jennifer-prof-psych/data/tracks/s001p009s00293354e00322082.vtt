00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.370
Yeah. Okay, so this is a little bit of a story. So I took a class in my

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.890
 second semester. Freshman year of college, in linguistics on I love

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.410
 languages. I love Entomology. Where the words come from, how did they

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.930
 change? Um and so I took this linguistics class and I had this brilliant,

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.460
 brilliant teacher. She was so amazing. She was so engaging

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.980
 on. That was when I changed my major in my mind, um, to be foreign

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.500
 language, and I was going to just major in languages and be a translator

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.020
 for the U. N. Um, I love that class so much. It was like some ungodly

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.540
 hour like, eight o'clock in the morning. And I actually went

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.060
 every single time. I never missed a class because I was just so into

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.580
 the material. But she had a requirement, which was that you had thio.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.100
 We had We had all these homework assignments in addition to, like,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.620
 exams and stuff like that. And at the time, you know, my thinking

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.150
 was, well, home workers for people who need it. Obviously I don't because

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.670
 I clearly have this material down. I love it. I understand it.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.190
 I literally got the highest grade on every single one of her exams.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.710
 So, you know, obviously didn't need to do the homework. And so imagine

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.230
 my surprise. At the end of the semester when she failed me, I was

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.750
 stunned. I literally thought it was a mistake. I never would have

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.270
 approached a teacher to argue a grade, but I honestly thought this was

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.790
 clearly a clerical error. She had assigned me the wrong grade, so

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.310
 I met with her and I was like, Yeah, you know, I I understand. You're

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.830
 busy and you have a lot of things. I'm totally get it. And she's

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.360
 like, Oh, no, I remember this. She's like it broke my heart because

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.880
 you were an amazing student. You were there every class. You did really

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.400
 well on the exam. But this was a requirement of the class, which

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.920
 I made very clear, and you didn't do it. And so you fail. So that was

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.440
 a hard pill to swallow. And so I ended up applying for course forgiveness

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.960
 and taking the class again the following semester so that I

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.480
 could just replace that f with whatever you're in the next semester.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.000
 Onley next semester, I got this other professor who was awful horrible.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.520
 The whole class was different. It was terrible. And it was so

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.050
 bad, mainly because I knew how good it could have been because I had

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.570
 had that experience and it was awesome. And this was just the worst.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.090
 And I hated it. I hated every second of it. I didn't like him as a

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.610
 professor on. I just had to suffer through it because of my own terrible

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.130
 decisions.
