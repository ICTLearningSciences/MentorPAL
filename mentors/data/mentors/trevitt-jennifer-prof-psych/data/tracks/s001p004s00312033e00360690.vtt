WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.060
I teach psychology at Cal State Fullerton University. Uh, in particular.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.270
 I teach bio psychology, which is kind of the intersection of biology

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:16.480
 and then psychology. Eso We're kind of looking at psychological

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.690
 constructs like cognition and emotions and behavior through the lens

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.900
 of biology. So when you're angry, what is what's going on in your brain?

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.110
 What's going on in your body like what's changing versus when

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.320
 you're not angry? Um, I teach that as a lecture. I also have a lab component

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.530
 to that, and then the other classes that I teach. I teach psychopharmacology,

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.740
 which is specifically looking at how drugs and other

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.950
 substances affect the brain and how then that plays out into things

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.160
 like changes in behavior and changes in perception. Um, and we also

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.370
 cover, like addiction and things like that on day. Then I teach

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.580
 intermediate research methods and statistics, which is awesome class,

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.800
 where we're kind of putting together the information that students

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.010
 learn about basic statistics with the information they learn about

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.220
 basic research design. So we're kind of now looking at them both simultaneously

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.430
 on bond answering questions like, Well, if this is, you

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.640
 know, if this is how I planned my experiment. Then what kind of statistics

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.850
 do I need to use Thio? Show what I want to show on DSO There's

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.060
 the four classes that I teach. Um and other, Aside from my teaching,

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.270
 I also do research. And the main focus of my personal research is

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.480
 looking at how what we eat effects, how we feel. So I'm the kind of

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.690
 formal version of that is the effect of nutrition on mental health

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.900
 and learning and in mental when I say mental health, what I'm really

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.110
 looking at is depression and anxiety. Eso yeah, essentially, I'm just

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.320
 looking at you know how what we eat effects, how we feel and how

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.530
 we learn. And I think it's a really fascinating, uh, topic at one of

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.740
 the things I love about it is that it's very accessible, like all of

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.950
 us eat. All of us eat every single day. Most of us eat, and what we

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.160
 are eating has some really strong impacts on how we're feeling and

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.370
 how we're learning. The other thing that I do in terms of research

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.580
 is I'm part of a research group on campus that looks at, um, fibromyalgia,

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.790
 which is a disease state that, uh, the main feature of it is

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.000
 pain. So we look at fibromyalgia and also other types of diseases that

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.210
 are plagued by pain. Um, and this is, ah, study where we've it's

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.420
 called a longitudinal study where we've actually followed people over.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.630
 Now it's over a decade, and they come in every couple of years, and

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.840
 we take a lot of bunch of we take a lot of different measurements

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.050
 from them. So we look at things like, you know, how are they moving?

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.260
 We have a lot of physical measurements. We also have cognitive measurements.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.470
 So we give them a lot of like cognitive tests on day. Then

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.690
 we also do like, you know, emotional test like, How are you feeling

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.900
 that kind of stuff? And then we take all sorts of other data on them.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.110
 On Ben, we can look at the data. We can look at it year by year,

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.320
 so we could look at just a given year, and we have people who have

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.530
 fibromyalgia and other pain conditions, and we also have people who

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.740
 don't. So we we kind of these air are control groups. Eso we can compare

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.950
 people within a given year. But we can also look at people across

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.160
 here so we can see how you know, for instance, one of the questions

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.370
 that I'm working on right now is for the people who have fibromyalgia

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.580
 are the ones who are taking particular types of medications in

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.790
 this case, antidepressants. Are they faring better over time? Compared

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.000
 Thio? People who have fibromyalgia who aren't taking antidepressants.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.210
 And so that's the question that were that I am personally looking

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.420
 at in this Richard group right now.
