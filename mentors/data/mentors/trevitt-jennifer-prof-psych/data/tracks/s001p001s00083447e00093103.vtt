00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.510
I think the thing I find the most interesting about my job probably has

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:12.160
 to do with my research, the research questions that I'm kind of trying

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.820
 thio ask pertaining Thio how what we eat effects, how we feel and

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.470
 how we learn Um, to me, that's just fascinating. And it seems like

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.130
 every time I learned something Mawr it opens 10 more doors to questions

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.790
 I had never even considered. Um So the deeper I go into that information

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.440
 the mawr of it, I find eso. In some ways, I feel like I will

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.100
 never stop being interested in this question. Um, so that's probably

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.750
 the part of my job that I find really the most just fascinating

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.410
 right now.
