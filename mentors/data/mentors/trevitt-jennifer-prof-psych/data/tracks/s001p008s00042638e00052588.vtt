00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.100
I think probably my fears were the ones that a lot of college students

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.350
 have, which that I wasn't good enough. I wasn't smart enough. I wasn't

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.600
 disciplined enough. Thio be successful. You know, I didn't know

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.850
 if I was going to be able Thio do the things that were asked of me,

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.100
 and it seemed very daunting. Um, but what I learned is that you know,

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.350
 you you don't start off in a PhD program, you start off in a bachelor's

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.600
 program and you kind of work your way through it and you work

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.850
 your way up to and same thing you don't start off with 400 level classes.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.100
 You start off with 100 level classes and you work your way through

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.350
 s Oh, yeah, I think that at every step of the way, those have always

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.600
 been my primary fears. Is that like I just don't you know, I'm

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.850
 not smart enough. I don't I don't work hard enough. I don't anything

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.100
 enough, and I'm just not going to be able to do it. And so far I've

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.350
 proved myself wrong. Every time
