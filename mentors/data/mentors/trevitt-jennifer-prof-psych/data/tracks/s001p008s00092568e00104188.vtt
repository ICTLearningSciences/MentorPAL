00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.710
How many hours do you have? I have made so many mistakes in my career,

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:12.570
 Um, both in my education in my, you know, early jobs in my job. Now

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.430
 I make mistakes all the time. Um, I think that the thing that's constant

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.300
 about all of the mistakes that I have made, or at least one of

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.160
 the big themes and all of the mistakes that I have made is that they

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.020
 have resulted from decisions that I have made based on what other

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.880
 people think I should dio as opposed Thio listening to myself and what

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.740
 I think is right for me. Usually when I make decisions based on what's

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:53.600
 right for me, those work out well when I make decisions based

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.470
 on what other people think I should dio. Those tend not to work out

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.330
 as well with some notable exceptions. But I'm just, you know, listen

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.190
 to what you want be guided by your interests and what works for you.
