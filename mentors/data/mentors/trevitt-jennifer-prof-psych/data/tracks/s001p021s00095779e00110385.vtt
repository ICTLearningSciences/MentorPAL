00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.930
as a field. I would say that psychology is probably on the liberal side

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.010
 of the liberal conservative spectrum. Um, particularly given that

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.090
 the psychology is concerned with, you know, individual differences and

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.180
 things like that. I think we're probably a little, you know, we're

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.260
 more liberal than you know, other fields of study, like maybe math

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.340
 or engineering or something like that. Um, you know, we study human

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.420
 beings and human beings are very different than anybody who studies

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.500
 human beings realizes, like, Wow, there's a lot of different ways to

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.580
 be and and to be happy and successful in all that, all that. So we're

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.670
 probably more liberal than than some fields. But at the same time,

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.750
 you know, most of the, you know, the leaders in the field, if you

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.830
 look at them, are white men. And so, you know, I think that there there

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.910
 is somewhat of a conservative bias, uh, inherent in that
