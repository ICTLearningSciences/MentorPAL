00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.820
That's a great question. You want ultimately, to have strong, positive

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.800
 letters. So my advice is Thio pick people number one who like you,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.770
 Um, number two who know you pretty well. So So one of the most common

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.750
 things that happens, for instance, in my own career is I have students

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.720
 who have taken a class with me and, you know, have enjoyed the

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.690
 class, maybe came to office hours a couple of times and talk to me.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.670
 And then they're gonna apply for grad graduate school, and they asked

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.640
 me if I could write them a letter. And while I'm willing, I always

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.620
 advise them that given the very limited nature of our relationship,

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.590
 there is really not much I can say about them individually that, you

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.570
 know, couldn't be assessed from, like maybe reading their transcripts.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.540
 And so that's a week letter, you know, letters that can't offer

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.510
 anything more than she was a good student and showed up to class on

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.490
 time and always raised her hand and knew the right answer. That's not

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.460
 a strong letter. Um, um you want someone to be able to testify thio

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.440
 other things like your work ethic through experience with you. You

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.410
 know your ability to think on your feet your ability to manage adversity

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.380
 and setbacks. Um, you know, your leadership abilities. Also,

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.360
 your ability to be a team member thes air, all things that are really

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.330
 going to make your letter strong. And so, you know, people who can

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.310
 testify to those things are people that you have worked with closely,

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.280
 Um, and so you know, you want to You don't want to be in a position

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.260
 of looking at who you know who could maybe fill those positions who

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.230
 fit those bills. What you really want to dio is you want to start

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.200
 creating those people by, you know, starting to work with faculty members

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.180
 starting Thio dio a new internship position. Um, you know, finding

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:15.150
 a job that that has something to do with the skill sets that you're

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.130
 going to need to be successful in graduate school. So you want

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.100
 to start creating your letter writers instead of trying to find them

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.070
 at some point when you want apply to graduate school. The other thing

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.050
 that I would also strongly recommend is that you are very up front

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.020
 and say to your letter writers in the process of asking them, I would

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.000
 love a strong positive letter of recommendation from you. Could

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.970
 you provide me with one? Don't just say, Can you write me a letter?

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.950
 Because anyone can write a letter. But you want a strong, positive

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.920
 letter, and so you want to be very explicit. And that also gives the

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.890
 faculty member and out. Because if they really kind of feel like you

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.870
 know what? I can't They can tell you that they can say, You know,

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.840
 I'm not sure if I could write a really strong, positive letter, and

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.820
 that kind of gives them an out because you don't want anyone writing

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.790
 you a letter. Who is not writing you a strong, positive letter.
