00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.330
psychology is an interesting major. I would say it's it can be easy. In

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.800
 some ways, it's easy because it's intuitive. I think there's a higher

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.280
 degree of of, um, like intuition and just kind of a e. I mean, we're

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.750
 all human beings, and psychology is the study of human beings.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.230
 Um and so I think that makes it very accessible and can make it kind

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.710
 of intuitive and easy. On the other hand, psychology is a science and

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.180
 eso while we may be studying human beings, we're doing that in a

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.660
 very, uh, very kind of structured method. A logical way on DWI collect

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.140
 data. And we analyzed data, which means we need to know things like

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.610
 statistics and stuff like that. So I think that there are parts of

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.090
 it that, um can be thought of is to be, like, harder or just more

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.560
 challenging. Um, and then there are parts that are easier, but honestly,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.040
 I think the same can be said for every major
