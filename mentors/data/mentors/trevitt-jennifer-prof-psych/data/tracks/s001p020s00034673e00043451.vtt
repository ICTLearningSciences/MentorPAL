00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.160
staying motivated can be tricky. For me, one of the ways that I stay motivated

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.470
 is I try to break up big tasks into smaller steps, and then

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.780
 as I complete each of the steps, I try to reward myself in some small

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:22.090
 way. So it may be that if I can get a lecture done, then I can watch

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.390
 one of my favorite shows that night. Um, or I can take some time

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.700
 to do something else, but breaking big tasks into small pieces and

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.010
 then giving yourself a pat on the back or or a small reward as you accomplish

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.320
 each individual step can go a long way towards keeping you

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.630
 motivated and engaged in the process.
