Yeah, I've got a lot of really good advice. And I think for me personally,

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:16.740
 the best advice that I've gotten is to listen to myself. Okay?

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:24.680
 And to Onley, measure my success by standards or metrics that I myself

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:32.630
 have chosen as opposed Thio. What other people think I should dio

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:40.570
 think I should be, how high I should jump. The only person I should

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:48.520
 always be working to, not disappoint, is myself.
