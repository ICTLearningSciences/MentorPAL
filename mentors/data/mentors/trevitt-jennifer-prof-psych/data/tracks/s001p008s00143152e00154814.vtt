00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.640
That's a hard question because I like where I am. And the way that I got

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.430
 here was by making all the decisions that I made. Um, I don't know

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.220
 if I would do anything differently. Um, if there are things that you

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.010
 know like, So for instance, I could say, Well, if I was going to

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.790
 do it differently, I would not have done the master's program. I would

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.580
 have just gone right into a PhD program, but I don't know if that

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.370
 would have worked out the same way, because I don't know if I was ready

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.160
 for a PhD program at the time when I was doing my master's work,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.950
 I think that I needed Thio mature a little bit. I needed to be a little

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.740
 bit more solid in terms of you know, what, I wanted to dio um,

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.530
 so there's really not a lot that I would look back on and say, like,

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.320
 I honestly cannot point to a single example that I would say, Yeah,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.100
 I would totally do that over again. Oh, maybe one. I would turn in

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.890
 my homework in my linguistics class my freshman year so that I wouldn't

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.680
 have failed it and had to take it again. I would do that differently,

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.470
 but that's about it.
