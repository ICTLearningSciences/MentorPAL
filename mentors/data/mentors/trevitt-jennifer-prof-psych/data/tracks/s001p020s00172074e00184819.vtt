00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.990
it is possible to graduate in four years, but there are a few circumstances

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.140
 that have to be in place. I think for that to happen, Number one,

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.280
 you have to be able to go to school full time every semester during

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.430
 that four year period. And to be successful that it means that you

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.570
 cannot be, for instance, holding down a full time job. At the same

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.710
 time, most students who work full time are not successful when they

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.860
 attempt to take a full time load. So if you're working 20 hours a

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.000
 week or less than it may be possible, Um, but again, the time requirement

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.150
 for a full time load is really like a full time job. It's about

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.290
 40 hours a week. Eso you've gotta have that time to devote, um, depending

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.440
 on your major, depending on the requirements. And if you have

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.580
 a minor, um, you may also find that you're going to need to take classes

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.720
 either during one of the summer sessions or in the intercession,

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.870
 which is the session over winter. Um, so if you could do that and

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.010
 again, you know you can't probably be working during those times because

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.160
 or at least not full time, Um, then it may be possible for you

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.300
 to graduate in four years
