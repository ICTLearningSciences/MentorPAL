00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.020
the importance of extracurriculars kind of depends a lot on, for instance,

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.200
 the career path that you're on. So if you're participating in extracurricular

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.370
 activities that are directly related to the career you

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.550
 are looking for, then they could be really, really helpful. Um, because

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.720
 essentially they count as, like, experience in the field. Um,

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.900
 but if it's, you know, if you're part of an extracurricular activity

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.070
 that really doesn't have anything to do with your major or with your

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.250
 career path, um, then it's probably not gonna be terribly helpful

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.420
 in terms of getting into graduate school or finding a job.
