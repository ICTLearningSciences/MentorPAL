00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.040
psychology has AH lot of different areas. Um, there are areas that look

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.230
 at relationships between people. So social psychology, looking at,

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.420
 like groups and things like that. There's cultural psychology, looking

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.610
 at different cultures. There is a sensation and perception, which

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.800
 is kind of like bio psychology. And you could argue that it's like

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.990
 a sub field of bio psychology where you're specifically focusing on

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.180
 how we bring sensory information into our bodies and how we process

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.370
 that, uh, developmental psychology. Looking at how you know how people

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.560
 grow up and age. Even so, going it, developmental psychology spans

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.750
 the whole lifespan. So there's, you know, from birth, maybe even

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.940
 before birth. Thio death. Um, there's bio psychology, which is my preferred

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.130
 realm, um, their statistical psychology. So there's some psychologists

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.320
 that just look at statistics and how they work. Um, there's

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.510
 industrial organizational psychology, which looks at how companies

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.700
 work or large groups of people work. Um, there are so many facets

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.890
 of psychology. It is really just surprising how many different little

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.080
 niches of psychology there are
