00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.770
e. I think the main difficulties that I experienced pursuing my PhD was

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.690
 that my I guess my expectations of what it was going to be like were

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.620
 not entirely accurate. Um, I like in my PhD experience Thio, you

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:24.540
 know, getting married or me or becoming a parent. It's never what you

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:30.460
 think it's gonna be. It was so much harder in the sense, Um, it was

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.380
 it was so much more work than I thought it was gonna be like the work

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.310
 hours were just intense and and it was longer in a way that I thought

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:48.230
 it would be. Not that it was time ways really longer, But just

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.150
 you know how hard it was for how long was not what I anticipated. Um,

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:00.070
 and so, you know, I did come to a point about two years in where

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.000
 I was like, I'm done. I don't want to do this anymore. Um, and I had

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.920
 some soul searching conversations with my mentor and with some other

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.840
 people that I trusted, and I did come to the conclusion ultimately

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.760
 toe stay, stay with the program and keep doing it. But yeah, it was

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.690
 just it was a lot. It was a lot more intense than than I thought that

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.610
 it waas that it was gonna be
