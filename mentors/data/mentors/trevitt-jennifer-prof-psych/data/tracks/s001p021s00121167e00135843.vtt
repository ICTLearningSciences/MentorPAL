00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.190
I think that some basic ways that you can stand up for people who are

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.530
 facing discrimination is to number one. Look at your own behavior and

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.860
 see in what ways you are supporting that discrimination. Eso This

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.200
 could be things like, You know, Are you laughing at racial jokes about

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.540
 these people or this group of people? Are you allowing other people

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.880
 to tell these jokes in your present and not saying like That's not

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.220
 funny or that's not appropriate? So are, you know, examine your own

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.550
 behavior and see if there, anyway, is that you're complicit. Um, in

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.890
 that Andi, then, you know, speak up. And if people are being inappropriate,

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.230
 say this is inappropriate. Um, this is not, you know, this

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.570
 is You shouldn't be saying these things. They're doing these things.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.910
 Um, the other thing I think that's really important is Thio instead

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.240
 of advocating for minority students. And this is particularly true

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.580
 if you yourself are not a minority student. Um, instead of kind of

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.920
 grabbing the banner and marching at the front of the parade, I think

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.260
 you need Thio. Um, be be circumspect and instead look for the leaders

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.600
 of color who are already leading this parade and essentially followed

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.930
 there. Direction eso support them. But you're you're not leading

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.270
 the parade. You are You are You are supporting the people who are

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.610
 already doing this work.
