00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.230
the mental relationship is a very personal one. And, you know, being able

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.620
 thio, rely on your mentor toe, have your best interests at heart.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.000
 Being able to trust your mentor is a paramount importance in that

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.390
 relationship. So if you find yourself in an antagonistic relationship

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.770
 with your mentor, that is probably a sign that you need to find a

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.150
 different mentor. Your mentor relationship should be a really positive

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.540
 relationship in your life. It doesn't mean that you're never going

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.920
 to disagree with your mentor or that there may be going to give you

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.310
 advice that you don't like. Um, but you should never doubt that your

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.690
 mentor is, ah, 100% in your corner and really wants the best for

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.080
 you. So if you are feeling like you're not sure that's true, you probably

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.460
 need to find a different mentor.
