00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.460
I think that it's probably pretty easy in the sense that because the psychology

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.070
 degree is applicable to so many different career tracks, um,

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.690
 you're not as limited as you would be if you had a degree in geology,

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.300
 for instance, Um, on the other hand, it is, um or, I would say,

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.910
 especially at the bachelor's level, it's a more generalized skill set.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.520
 And so it might be harder for you to get jobs that require a very

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.130
 specific skill set. So, like, you know, in mathematics or something

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.750
 like that, that might be harder job to get with a degree in psychology.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.360
 But I think on balance, you'll have more jobs open to you with

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.970
 or more career paths open to you with a degree in psychology.
