00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.220
I think that I was always kind of, I guess, interested. Or maybe aware

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.600
 is a better word for it. My dad was a clinical psychologist and he

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.970
 was actually working on his PhD when I was kind of a young kid. I think

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.340
 he got his PhD when I was about five or six, and so this was just

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.720
 always a topic around our house on. But he you know, he had to do

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.090
 a lot of testing, learned how to do tests. And so my siblings and I

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.460
 work his guinea pigs that we were always taking lots of different tests

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.830
 and he would talk to us about it, what they were supposed to be

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.210
 doing. So I think I've always been kind of interested, At least in psychology,

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.580
 Yeah.
