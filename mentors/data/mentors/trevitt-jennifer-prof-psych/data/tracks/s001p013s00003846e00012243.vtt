00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.850
there are some required classes that you have to take and some of those

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.840
 you're going to have to take in a certain order. The best place to

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.840
 get information about those classes in the order that you need to take

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.840
 them in is either just by looking at the psychology department course

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.840
 catalog or by going to the psych advising office. After that,

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.830
 you'll have, um, units that you can fill with elective. Sometimes you'll

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.830
 have, like, a choice of several different classes, and you just

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.830
 need to take one or two choices. Um, and when it comes to those types

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.830
 of things, I would just go with what interests you the most. Which

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.820
 what what courses are really interesting to you and take those those

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.820
 classes.
