00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.090
I'd like to think that I'm doing several things to support minority students.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.340
 Um, one of the things that I think is really important for for

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.580
 my minority students is Thio know that they can approach me and they

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.820
 can ask me questions and that I'm a resource for them. Um, many

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.070
 of our students are first generation college students, so they're the

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.310
 first ones in their families to attend college. And they may not therefore

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.550
 have people at home advising them. You know how to interact

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.800
 with professors, for instance, and you know what's appropriate and

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.040
 what's not. And I think that they do tend toe air on the side of being

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.280
 super respectful to the point where they won't seek help. Um, or

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.530
 they feel uncomfortable sending me an email and saying like, I don't

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.770
 understand this. Can I meet with you on DSO? One of the things that

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.010
 I really try hard to dio is to emphasize multiple times throughout

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.260
 the semester with the students in my classes that if you have a question,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.500
 if you're struggling, please come and see me. I would much rather

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.750
 that you come and see me with, you know, a question that maybe you

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.990
 know isn't appropriate. Rather than not ask the question. Um, so

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.230
 that's one of the things that I really try. Toe Try to dio, uh, to support

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.480
 my students, who are particularly first time college students.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.720
 But in our demographics, those particular students tend overwhelmingly

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.960
 to be minority students s. So I think that that's one way that

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.210
 I'm. I work to help minority students. Another way is thio be involved

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.450
 in mentorship programs. I'm involved in one maximizing access to

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.690
 reach research careers that specifically targets, uh, minorities in

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.940
 in various fields on dso. I've been participating in that program for

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.180
 a number of years and have mentored students through that program.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.420
 And also the McNerney near scholars is another program that I've worked

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.670
 with closely. Eso. So those air a couple of the ways that I've

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.910
 tried, um, Tiu really support specifically minority students
