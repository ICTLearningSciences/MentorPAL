00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.270
you can ask the internship coordinator right now. I believe that position

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.690
 is held by Dr Joanne Stows, Um, but you can always just ask at the

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.110
 psychology department office and they'll tell you who's who's in

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.530
 charge of it. And they usually have a list of possible internships and

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.950
 these air like sites that we've worked with before. Also, though,

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.380
 you confined your own internship site or person that you're gonna be

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.800
 working with, and they can fill out some paperwork and become an official

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.220
 internship site, and then you can work with them. So you could

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.640
 either look from kind of like a pre approved list or you could go

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.060
 out and find your own internship site.
