I would say you'd probably want to get us close to a four point. Oh, is

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:13.290
 possible? Maybe, You know, I mean, shoot for a four point. Oh, it

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.520
 may not happen, but the closer you can get to that, the better. I definitely

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.740
 would not drop below a 3.5 if you can help it.
