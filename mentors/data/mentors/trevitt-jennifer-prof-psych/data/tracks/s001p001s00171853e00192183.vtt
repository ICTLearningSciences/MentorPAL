00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.720
So some of the misconceptions that I've run across, um are that I don't

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.590
 work during the summer. That's my favorite. You have the summers off.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.460
 No, no, I do not. Um, and that the biggest one, I think, actually

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.340
 is that teaching, lecturing, standing in front of the class and talking

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.210
 that that is essentially the biggest part of my job. And that's

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.080
 what I dio. And so the idea is that if I'm not actively lecturing,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.950
 then I'm not working. And so, you know, I mean, if you look at my schedule

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.820
 so I teach three classes a semester and each of those classes

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.690
 has about two, 24 hours of lecture every week. So really, I mean,

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.560
 I'm lecturing for 10 hours a week. Maybe it's actually a very small

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.440
 part of my job, but a lot of people kind of think that that's all of

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.310
 my job on. But I don't think that there's kind of the realization that

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.180
 for every hour that I'm lecturing, there's a whole bunch of prep,

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.050
 and then there's a whole bunch of stuff that has to happen after that.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.920
 So the lecture part is just this little, teeny tiny sliver of what

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.790
 I'm doing. Really. The bulk of the work is on either side of that,

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.660
 and that's just for teaching. I mean, then I have the whole research

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.540
 component and that, you know, most people don't see that at all.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.410
 Eso that maybe is another misconception that people have. Is that really

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.280
 all I do is teach and actually the teaching the the giving the

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.150
 lecture is such a small, tiny part of what I dio.
