00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.330
So my advice to you in trying to kind of what you should look for in a

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.820
 graduate program graduate school is hard. It's not horrible. It's just

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.300
 hard. And so in my experience, unless you really love and are committed

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.790
 to what you're doing, you are not. You're not going to want

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.270
 to stay if because it's just it's so hard. Like, even if you really,

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.760
 really love it, it's still hard. So if you didn't really love it, it

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.240
 would just be awful, right? So I would look for graduate program,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.730
 that is, you know, focused in an area that is very interesting to you.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.210
 You don't want to devote your time and money to an area of research,

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.700
 for instance, that you are just not that interested in, um, make

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.180
 sure something you really want to dio, um the other thing is, you wanna

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.660
 look at the lab culture, so, you know, are the people who are working

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.150
 in that lab, are they the type of people that you like is the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.630
 is the overall style of the lab, a style that you're comfortable with,

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.120
 Um, for the person who you're going to be working with, who's gonna

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.600
 be your mentor or they, you know, How do you communicate? How do

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.090
 they communicate? You know, do you jibe? Well, those are the types

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.570
 of things that you really do wanna look at because these are the people

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.060
 that you're gonna be working with for multiple years. And so you

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.540
 really do want to make sure that this is a good fit for you, not just

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.030
 in terms of what the lab is doing. So the research of the lab, but

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.510
 also just the lab culture itself.
