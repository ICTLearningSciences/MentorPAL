00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.190
I do have pets. I have at the moment I have three dogs and three cats,

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:13.530
 and I'm gonna say 15 chickens. Although technically they're not pets,

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.870
 They're working animals. Eso we don't We don't consider them to be

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:26.210
 pets. We've also had snakes and lizards and fish. I think the only

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.550
 thing we've never had as a pet really is birds and rabbits. But yeah,

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.890
 pretty much all the other pets we've had.
