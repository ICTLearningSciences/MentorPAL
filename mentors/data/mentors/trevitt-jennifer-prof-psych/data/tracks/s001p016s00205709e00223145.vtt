00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.340
I think the best way to choose a graduate program is to go there. If you

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.840
 can, um, physically go to the location and spend some time with,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.330
 you know, for instance, the faculty, um, you know, in the department

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.820
 and the labs take a tour, meet the other graduate students and talk

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.320
 to them. Ask them lots of questions about, you know, what is it like

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.810
 being a graduate student in this program? Or what is it, like working

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.300
 in this particular lab or with this particular person and get a

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.800
 much information as you can and just be really, really try toe measure

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.290
 the vibe? You know, like, what is it like, Are these people very

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.780
 serious? Are they? Do they seem committed? Are they fun? Are they crazy?

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.280
 Like And it's not that, anyway, is wrong. What you're looking for

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.770
 is what works for you. What's the best fit for you? Um, and hands

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.260
 down there is nothing like being there. So if you can possibly go to

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.760
 the graduate school, um, I would strongly recommend doing that, and

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.250
 sometimes this is something that you can kind of bargain with. Like

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.740
 if somebody has made you an offer and wants a decision. You could

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.240
 say to them I would really like to come out there in person if you haven't

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.730
 already been. Um, And before I make a decision, and oftentimes

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.220
 they will offer to, you know, bring you out and and put you up while

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.720
 you're there at their expense, and I would definitely take advantage

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.210
 of that, if you can.
