00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.820
I think what I wish I had known back then was that the time pressure that

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.800
 I felt that I was under was not as intense as I thought it was.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.770
 I think that in this was kind of true. I think through all of my educational

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.750
 activities that I always felt like I was on this, like time

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.730
 courts, like I had to finish in so many years or so many semesters.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.700
 And I was, you know, I mean, it took me five years to get my bachelor's

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.670
 degree, which at the time I felt like, you know, I was behind.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.650
 And then instead of going right into a PhD program, I went through a

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.620
 master's program and, you know, and so again I was behind, you know,

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.600
 And I felt like when I got to my PhD program, you know, I was I was

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.570
 behind all of the other students who graduated college in four years

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.550
 and then went right into a PhD program. Um, and what I realized now,

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.520
 from the vantage point of, you know, 30 years later, is that it

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.500
 doesn't matter. You know, if it took me six years to get my bachelor's

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.470
 degree it really wouldn't have changed my life all that much if I

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.450
 had to take me three years to get my Masters degree or seven years

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.420
 to get my PhD. Just I don't think that in the end it really would have

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.400
 made a huge difference in the quality of my life, my happiness, um,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.370
 any of those things. So I think that if I could go back and do it

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.350
 again, I would just relax a little bit in terms of like the time.
