00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.130
students asked me how to get involved in research all the time, and I

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.400
 am happy to say it's actually pretty easy. So if you go to the department

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.680
 website and look under the faculty page, there are blurbs about

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.960
 all of the full time faculty members, and if you click on the links,

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.240
 it will take you to our BIOS. And it'll tell you about our current

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.510
 research interests, and we have to update this every year. So they're

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.790
 they should be current, Um, And after you read through those, if

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.070
 you find some, you know, if you find research that sounds really, really

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.350
 interesting to you, you can just go ahead and email that professor.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.620
 It doesn't matter if you've never had them for a class before.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.900
 It doesn't matter if you've never met them before. As professors, we

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.180
 expect these kinds of emails, um, or these types of requests from

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.450
 students. So don't be shy about doing that. You know, craft your letter

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.730
 carefully or your email carefully. Be respectful use, you know,

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.010
 formal email style. Um, but But don't hesitate to reach out to a professor

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.290
 and say, Hey, I read your research interests Bio and I think

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.560
 what you're doing is really fascinating. And I would love to join you

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.840
 if you have room on your research team.
