I do several different types of experiments, so I do some experiments

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.990
 with animal subjects. Rodents in particular those air generally, the

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.060
 studies where I'm looking at the effects of nutrition on anxiety and

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:21.120
 depression and learning. Um, and then I have some other studies that

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.190
 I do with human subjects. Right now, I'm doing a study looking at

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.260
 the effect of different taste sensations on, uh, mood. And then I'm

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.330
 also part of, ah, larger research group on campus where we study fibromyalgia

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.400
 and pain, and that's also with human subjects.
