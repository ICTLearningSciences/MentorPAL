00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.530
Okay. So when I started college as a freshman, I was at San Diego State

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.210
 University. I had chosen psychology is my major, but wasn't really

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.900
 super excited about it. I just needed something to kind of right in

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.580
 that. That spot on the application, Um, and really, my first two years

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.260
 of college were all about learning how to function on my own. So

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.940
 it was my first time living away from home. Um, for the first year,

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.620
 I was living in the dorms for the second year, I got this house with

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.300
 a like 8000 other people, like, literally. It was a two bedroom house,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.990
 and I think there were 10 of us living in it. It was crazy. S o.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.670
 I honestly think that the focus of that time in my college career

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.350
 was just on me kind of learning how to function as a semi adult, Um,

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.030
 in the last bit of my like the last couple of years of my bachelor's

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.710
 degree, Um, that's when I had kind of gotten a little bit more serious

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.390
 about school, mainly just because I wanted to finish like I did

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.080
 not want to be in. I didn't want to be working on my bachelors degree

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.760
 for like, eight years. I wanted to get done. Um, s o I was a little

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.440
 bit more focused on this student. Um, and I had, you know, kind of

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.120
 figured out the paying my bills and doing my laundry and, you know,

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.800
 feeding myself stuff, Thio at least a minimal level. Um, and you know,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.480
 and so I finished my bachelor's degree. And at that point, honestly,

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.170
 first of all, I was really interested in bio psychology and wanted

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.850
 to continue exploring it. And second of all, I also kind of felt

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.530
 like I am not prepared really to do anything like I didn't have, like,

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.210
 a career path, like, Okay, this is my next step. Um And so for

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.890
 that reason, I ended up going to graduate school. And so I was in a

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.570
 master's program and learning more about bio psychology and at that

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.260
 point, kind of learning more about career path and what might work for

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.940
 me in psychology. And ultimately that led me Thio joining a PhD program
