00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.330
specializations aren't necessary. But they can be helpful to you, particularly

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.820
 if you are looking to go either into graduate school or into

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.300
 a career in a particular sub field of psychology. Um, we don't have

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.780
 ah lot of concentrations within the department. Um, but there are

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:28.260
 a few so you could do a concentration, for instance, in statistics.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.750
 Or you could do a concentration in bio psychology. Andi, that might

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.230
 be really useful to you, depending on your career objectives.
