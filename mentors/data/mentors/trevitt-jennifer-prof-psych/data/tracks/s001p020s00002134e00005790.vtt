00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.070
I think the best tip for studying is to do it consistently. So I think

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.300
 a lot of students, often times want Thio wait until the end right before

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.520
 an exam and then study really hard. And research actually shows

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.740
 that for most people, a better way to study is just a little bit every

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.960
 day. Andi. Then maybe you know a longer time, right before an exam

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.190
 is kind of a review. But doing a little bit every day is probably

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:37.410
 the number one study tip that I can give you.
