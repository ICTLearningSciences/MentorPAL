00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.440
so the best things the best way to improve your chances of getting into

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.020
 grad school are to have the right experience for the programs that

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.610
 you're applying Thio to have good letters of recommendation and toe

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.200
 have a very well crafted personal statement. So for the first one having

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.780
 the experience, this is why you want to do things like you wanna

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.370
 work with a faculty member. You want to do research, you want to

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.960
 get some practical experience in the field into which you are, you know,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.540
 interested in pursuing a graduate degree because that is going

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.130
 to look really good on your application. Um, and it will distinguish

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.720
 you from people who you know don't have experience in the field. Um,

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.310
 you wanna have good letters of recommendation again? This is why it's

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.890
 really important to cultivate relationships with potential mentors

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.480
 with faculty members with employers, people who you can turn to later

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.070
 and ask for a positive strong letter of recommendation. And then

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.650
 finally, you want a well crafted personal statement. Eso you wanna

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.240
 make sure you've got really excellent writing skills and then you also

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.830
 want to take it and and have other people look at it and give you

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.410
 feedback on it. And so this is another place where mentors, uh, come,

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.000
 come in really handy is you could send them drafts and say, Hey,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.590
 you know, how does this look to you? Do you have any suggestions for

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.170
 improvement? So I think that those are the things that will increase

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.760
 your chances the most of getting into graduate school.
