00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.720
e think in psychology the skills that you really want to focus on developing

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.580
 our critical thinking skills. A lot of what we do in research

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.450
 is evaluating information, both the information that maybe we're generating

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.310
 with our research, but also the information that other people

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.180
 have generated eso learning how to think critically learning how

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.040
 thio logically evaluate information in terms of its quality is really,

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.910
 really important. Um, I think there are other skills that you can

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.780
 work on to develop as a psych major in particular, um, skills such

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.640
 a Z empathy, um, and listening skills that could be very, very helpful

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.510
 across a multitude of situations. Um, but honestly, if I if I had

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.370
 to point a one thing that you really should be trying to develop, I

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.240
 would say it's your critical thinking skills.
