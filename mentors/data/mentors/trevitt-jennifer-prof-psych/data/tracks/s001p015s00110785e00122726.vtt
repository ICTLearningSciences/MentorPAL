Yeah, it kind of depends. It depends on where you're looking for a future

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.190
 job. So, you know, there are some areas where having a PhD from

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.860
 a certain institution really really matters and, you know, or it's gonna

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.530
 look impressive on your your CV or something like that. And so

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.210
 that might increase your chances of getting a position. Um, I think

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.880
 that honestly, the most important thing is who you were, who you worked

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.550
 with and what kind of work you did. Um, And mainly because this

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.220
 is where you're going to establish your network. You know, doing doing

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.890
 the work is where you're going to meet other people who are doing

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.560
 that same kind of work or similar work, or at least working in a similar

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.230
 area. And this is the basis of your network. And so when you go

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.900
 to find a job in this area, these are the people who are gonna know

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.580
 who's hiring or who were going to be at companies that you're interested

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.250
 in working for eso. In that sense, I think that the you know,

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.920
 the work you dio and the people that you meet while you're doing that

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.590
 work are going to be much more important for your future career than

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.260
 you know the school where you happen to be doing that work.
