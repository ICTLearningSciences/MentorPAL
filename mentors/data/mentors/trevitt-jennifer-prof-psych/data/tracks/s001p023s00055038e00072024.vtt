00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.340
because I have a career that I enjoy and a family that I enjoy and friends

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.840
 and all sorts of things. I also have a lot of stress in my life.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.330
 I just have a lot of things going on all the time. And so I have made

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.820
 a point to develop a couple of good, um, methods for kind of reducing

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.320
 my stress both in the long term and also in the short run. So,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.810
 uh, stress management for the long term for me mainly has to do with

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.300
 what I eat, making sure that I'm eating, Ah, diet that really supports

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.790
 my body. Um, and making sure that I get enough sleep every night.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.290
 Um, in the short run, what helps me manage my stress is exercise

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.780
 and not, you know, not real strenuous exercise. But when I feel myself

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.270
 getting really stressed out, um, I find that just going for a five

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.770
 minute walk is really, really helpful. Just the physical activity

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.260
 of moving my body and also just the change of scene, um really, really

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.750
 helps me to kind of get some of that energy out so that when I get

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.250
 back, I can really refocus um I also use breathing exercises for short

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.740
 term management of stress. So, you know, before I have to give

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.230
 a talk or, you know, before, like, a meeting or something like that

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.720
 where I'm kind of feeling a little angsty and stress. Um, I have a breathing

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.220
 exercise that I do that can really call me down in just a matter

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.710
 of minutes.
