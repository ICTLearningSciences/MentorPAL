00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.820
probably in a million little ways that I'm not even conscious of. Now,

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.800
 I do think that okay, My parents divorce showed me a couple of things.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.770
 Number one, they watching my mom be a single mom. Um, and, you know,

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.740
 raised my brother and I by herself essentially, because we we were

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.720
 in Hawaii for the school year. And then we would go visit my dad

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.690
 in California during the summer months. Um, so she essentially it was

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.660
 totally single parenting it for nine months. A good good 9 to 10

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.640
 months out of every year. And watching her do that, I think taught me

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.610
 that, you know, women can do a lot. Um, I don't think either of my

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.580
 parents were particularly sexist at all. If anything, they were not

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:06.560
 that, um, but watching the example of my mom kind of head a family

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.530
 all by yourself on her own and and figure it out, Um, really, I think

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.500
 contributed to my sense of possibility and just ability. My dad, you

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.480
 know, he was a clinical psychologist. And so from early as I can

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.450
 remember, I've always kind of known what psychology waas and talked

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.420
 about various psychological constructs and, you know, kind of just thought

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.400
 about things through that, that that lens of psychology s I'm

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.370
 sure that that that certainly influenced me to some. I mean, people

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:54.340
 are just fascinating. People are really And why do people do the things

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.320
 they dio? That it's such an interesting question, and and the idea

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.290
 that there may be actual reasons out of, you know, there may be

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.260
 reasons people do the things they do instead of just like people are

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.240
 weird. Um, that probably had something to dio with with my choosing

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.210
 the career path, Um, that I did.
