00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.590
graduate school is an experience unlike any other. In my opinion, um,

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:12.340
 it was one of the hardest things I've ever done in my whole life. Maybe

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:18.080
 outside of parenting, Um, you know, if I look back at experiences

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.820
 that just really pushed me to my absolute absolute limit, graduate

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.560
 school is definitely in the top two. Um, I probably shed more tears

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.310
 in graduate school than I have in the rest of my life. On the other

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:41.050
 hand, it was one of the best, greatest, most adventurist, packed with

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.790
 fun times I've also ever experienced My best friends to this day

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.540
 are people that I met in graduate school. My husband I met in graduate

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.280
 school. So the relationships that I made in graduate school are ones

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.020
 that are still sustaining me to this day. The network that I established

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:09.770
 in graduate school is still supporting me today, so it was

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.510
 a really intense experience. It was incredibly stressful at times. There

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.250
 were many, many days and nights where I was convinced that I was

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.990
 not gonna make it and that I was going to quit and that I was done.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.740
 Um, but in the end, I can definitely say it was one of the best experiences

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.480
 of my life.
