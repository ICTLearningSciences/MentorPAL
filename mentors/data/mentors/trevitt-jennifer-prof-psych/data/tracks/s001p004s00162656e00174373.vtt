00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.670
the fact that my father was a clinical psychologist really did affect

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.490
 my career choice. Not in the way that it might seem, but really, it

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.320
 was because of him that I chose. Psychology is a major initially, um,

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.140
 and that was just because the fact that he was a clinical psychologist,

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.960
 number one it meant that I was pretty familiar with a lot of psychological

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.780
 constructs because it was just things that we talked about

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.610
 at home. Um, and also, you know, he did it. Most of his friends

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.430
 were colleagues, and, you know, and they did it. And as a teenager,

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.250
 you know, I was looking at them and just going like, Well, you all are

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.070
 a bunch of idiots. So clearly this is something that, you know, I

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.900
 could dio because I'm so much smarter than you. Um, so that was really

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.720
 what set me on the path of psychology. And I mean, I did find it

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.540
 somewhat interesting, but it really wasn't the love of psychology that

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.360
 had was the reason that I chose psychology as a major, but it was

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.190
 definitely influenced by the fact that my dad was a clinical psychologist.
