00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.520
the choice to get a masters or a doctorate really depends on the job that

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.200
 you're seeking or the career path that you want to be on. Um, so

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.870
 I think that my first piece of advice would be Thio. You know, once

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.550
 you've kind of figured out what you want to dio do, find out, you know,

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.220
 seek out people who are doing that job, Um, either personally or

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.890
 just, you know, through the Internet or something like that. Or you

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.570
 can even look through, like job postings for that kind of job and

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.240
 see what is required to do what kind of degree is required to do that

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.920
 job. And honestly, if the job that you ultimately wanna be in requires

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.590
 a master's degree, there's really not a huge point in getting a

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.260
 PhD. It's a huge investment of time and money and, you know, for the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.940
 for the career that you're wanting, you don't need tohave it. So I

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.610
 would definitely take some time, do a little bit of research and find

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.290
 out what kind of degree you need based on the job or career. You

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.960
 ultimately want tohave
