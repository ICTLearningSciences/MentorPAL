00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.940
 faculty that you're taking classes from can become a part of your

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.630
 network. Your peers are part of your network. So this is one of

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.330
 the reasons why getting involved in student organizations like clubs

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.030
 or societies or things like that could be really useful is because

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.720
 these are all examples of individuals that are going to form a part

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.420
 of your network.
