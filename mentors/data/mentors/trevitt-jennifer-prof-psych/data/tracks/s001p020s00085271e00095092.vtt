It's pretty easy to get burned out if you're doing a lot at once. And

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.550
 so the way to avoid burnout is to pace yourself. Essentially be realistic

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.400
 about the time that you have available to you. And, you know,

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.250
 don't take too many courses. Try not to work more hours than you need

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.100
 Thio. Um, really pace yourself and take it slow. It's better to do

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.950
 that in the long run, because if you pace yourself, you're more likely

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.810
 to be successful in whatever it is that you're doing. Whereas if

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.660
 you try to take on a lot all at once, you're more likely Thio end up

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.510
 doing poorly, for instance, in your classes and then having to retake

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.360
 them. So it, even though it may seem like by pacing yourself, you're

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.210
 making your drawing the experience out. In the long run, you'll

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.060
 probably spend less time
