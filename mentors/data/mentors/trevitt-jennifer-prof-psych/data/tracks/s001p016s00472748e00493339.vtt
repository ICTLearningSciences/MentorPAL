00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.100
I actually love the idea of a gap year. I'll be honest. Um, that really

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.340
 wasn't a thing. I think when I was going through graduate school,

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.590
 it was just kind of one thing after another. Also, I personally knew

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.830
 my own temperament, and I had a sneaking suspicion that if I stopped

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.080
 my educational journey that I would not restart it. Um and so I just

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.330
 did not allow myself to take any kind of break between any of my

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.570
 programs. So I went right from my bachelors degree, to my master's degree

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.820
 to my PhD, Um, but I do think that taking a gap year could be

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.070
 really beneficial, particularly if you use that time wisely. Um, so

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.310
 if you use that gap year to explore the field, like if you think you

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.560
 want Thio, you know, do clinical psychology with Children, and you

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.800
 use that gap year to like work with Children in some capacity to see

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.050
 if this is maybe a population that you are okay working with. That's

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.300
 a great use of a gap year. Um, I think you can use the Gap year to

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.540
 take some more classes or do some more independent study learn more

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.790
 about the field off psychology in the different areas within it, so

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.040
 that when you do apply to graduate school, you're making a much more

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.280
 informed choice that that you're and that's gonna help you really

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.530
 select graduate schools or programs that are going thio be beneficial

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.770
 to you. Um, so I like the idea of a gap here. I don't think that it

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.020
 discredits the student at all, particularly if they could say, like,

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.270
 this is what I like. You know, if you can kind of spin it as an intentional

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.510
 gap here, I think that actually looks very mature. So I think

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.760
 a gap here is a good idea if it's done correctly.
