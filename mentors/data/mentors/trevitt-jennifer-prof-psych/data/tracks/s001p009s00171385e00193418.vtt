00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.530
I think it depends on what time of my life we're talking about in high

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.210
 school. I waas uh, okay, student. I wasn't I was never, like, straight

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.880
 A's or anything like that. Subjects that interested me. I did well

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.560
 in subjects that I hated. I did poorly in, um, I was kind of a shy

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.240
 student, so I didn't, like, seek out help. Usually, if I was having

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.920
 trouble, I just kind of suffered in silence and then did poorly. Um,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.590
 and I carried that tradition with me into my bachelor's degree, where

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.270
 the courses that I was really interested in I tended to do really

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.950
 well in and the ones like the G requirements, the ones I had to take

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.630
 I was less engaged in, did not put his much effort into, um and,

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.300
 you know, consequently tended not to do as well in those classes. Um,

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.980
 I think that once I got towards the end of my bachelor's degree,

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.660
 when I was just pretty much taking classes in psychology, I started

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.340
 to do a little bit better overall, Um, mainly because specifically for

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.020
 those courses that just weren't as engaging to me, I kind of just

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.690
 started realizing that I just needed to do well, Period. At that point,

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.370
 I was kind of thinking about the possibility of going to graduate

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.050
 school or doing something beyond just my bachelor's degree. And so

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.730
 I know that I I knew at that point that I needed to keep my my g p

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.400
 a up, Um And so I you know, I worked a little harder, particularly

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.080
 for those classes that just weren't is engaging to me. Um and then,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.760
 honestly, by the time I got to graduate school, I was a great student,

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.440
 but that's because I was absolutely 100% engaged. I I loved what

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.110
 I was doing. I loved all of my classes. Um, I just love the learning

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.790
 process. And even if a class wasn't something that I could directly

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.470
 see, like how I needed to have this information right now, I knew that

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.150
 I would probably need it sometime in the future. And so that just

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.820
 kept me engaged. So I think I finish really strong as a student. I

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.500
 was a great student at the time. I finished my PhD, but I definitely

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.180
 did not start out that way.
