00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.930
Yeah, I think what surprised me the most was how many different things

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.020
 were going on. I remember the first time I went to my first bio psychology

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.100
 conference. So there's a new annual conference called the Society

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.190
 for Neuroscience. And I remember going to the first one, and I

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.270
 was This was when I was in my PhD program and there were it was in

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.360
 this huge convention center and in this one just ginormous room, Um,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.440
 there were probably, like, 1000 posters and so posters, or where researchers

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.520
 go to kind of share their latest information and beat with

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.610
 other people who are kind of interested in the same things and talk

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.690
 to them. So they were like at least 1000 posters in this room, and

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.780
 these posters changed from the morning to the evening. So in the morning

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.860
 there were 1000 posters, and in the evening there were 1000 posters,

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.950
 and it did this for five days, and I was just absolutely blown

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.030
 away by how many different things people are looking at just really

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.120
 how big this field is. Just just neuroscience. Bio psychology, like

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.200
 not even psychology, is a general field like so So I think that's amazing.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.280
 It's it can be very overwhelming. It could be like Oh my goodness

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.370
 gracious. But I think the thing that's really exciting about it

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.450
 is that if you are kind of like trying to figure out like, Well, what

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.540
 do I want to do? Really, there are so many options open to you,

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.620
 anything that you can think of. There's probably somebody already semi

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.710
 looking at that or semi doing that and you can learn from them. So

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.790
 really, just it's limitless what you want to dio.
