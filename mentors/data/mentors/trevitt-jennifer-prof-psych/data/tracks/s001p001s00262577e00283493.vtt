00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.630
the coronavirus pandemic has definitely affected my work. Um, I really

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.420
 miss interacting with my students. It's been very difficult to not

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.200
 have that interaction with them, and it's made me realizing myself that

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.980
 interaction with my students is a huge motivation. It's a huge motivator

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.770
 for me on DSO when I don't have that, it's kind of like What's

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.550
 the point? Why am I doing this? Not entirely that bad, but it just

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.340
 I mean, I just really realized like That's so important to me. Thio

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.120
 have those interactions with my students. Um, it's also required

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.900
 me. Thio use different technologies that I have never used before. So

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.690
 I've had to, like, learn new programs and new ways of doing things.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.470
 And that has been challenging. Um, but also it's kind of cool, because

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.250
 now I feel like I could do a lot more than I could when this whole

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.040
 thing started. So I feel much more accomplished in you know, in

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.820
 that sense, um, but it does make things a little more difficulty. Um,

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.610
 I haven't another way that it's really affected. My work is that I

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.390
 mean, my research, for the most part, has just stopped like I I'm not

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.170
 collecting any data, and I have not been collecting data since the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.960
 university shut down in mid March S Oh, that's a huge thing, Andi.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.740
 I'm not honestly sure when I will be able to start collecting data

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.520
 again. So that's a little worrisome for me, Not kind of having a firm

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.310
 timetable in terms of like, Well, you know, you will be able to get

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.090
 your lab back up and running at this point like there's there's no

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.880
 date for that. So that's that's a little concerning. But, you know,

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.660
 we're all in the same boat, so or at least the same storm. So I feel

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.440
 like, you know, everybody's struggling with various issues and we

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.230
 just have to do the best we can. But, yeah, it's definitely affected

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.010
 my job for sure.
