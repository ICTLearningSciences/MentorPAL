Well, I think other than just the kind of normal aspect of trying to be

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:13.170
 welcoming Thio, you know, all students, regardless of several factors

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.330
 including race, sexual orientation, religious background, all of

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.490
 those things. Um, we do have a diversity and inclusion committee within

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.660
 our department that is working very hard. Thio ensure that we are

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.820
 addressing issues of non parody, particularly as they relate to students

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.980
 of color within our department. S O. I think that that's a good

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.140
 step forward. But this is just the beginning of a what will probably

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.300
 be a very long road.
