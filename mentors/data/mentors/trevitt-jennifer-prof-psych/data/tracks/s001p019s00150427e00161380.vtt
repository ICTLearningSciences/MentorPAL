00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.640
I think I've had a lot of really good advice from a lot of different people

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.440
 about my career in my life. Um, I think probably the best piece

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.230
 of advice that I got was from one of my original mentors, Dr Meg White,

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.030
 who I met when I was still doing my bachelor's degree. And she

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.820
 so she's been with me through the whole, you know, graduate school

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.610
 and post doctoral work and new faculty, uh, parts of my life. And she

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.410
 advised me, And this was, I think, when I was either still in graduate

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.200
 school or it was when I was in the early days of being a faculty

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.000
 member and she advised me, Thio base my career path on what was right

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.790
 for me, as opposed to what other people I felt that I should be

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.590
 doing. And that has really helped me thio keep perspective about you

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:10.380
 know what I am doing and how it is serving my life in general.
