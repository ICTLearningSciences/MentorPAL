00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.220
My name is Dr Jennifer Trav It I'm an associate professor in the psychology

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.580
 department at California State University, Fullerton. I did my

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.950
 undergrad at Fullerton, so I'm actually an alum. I did my PhD at the

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.320
 University of Connecticut, so I lived in Connecticut for about four

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.680
 years, and then I came back to California and worked at U. C. I. And

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.050
 then I started teaching at Cal State Fullerton. I study the effects

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.420
 of nutrition on anxiety, depression and learning, and the courses

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.790
 that I teach our bio psychology, which has a lecture component and

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.150
 a lab component. I also teach psychopharmacology, which is the study

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.520
 of how drugs affect the brain. And I also teach intermediate research

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.890
 methods and statistics. And I love all of these classes. I have three

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.250
 Children and I'm married. My Children are 15 years old. I actually

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.620
 have triplets. They were born the year after I started teaching

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.990
 at Cal State Fullerton. So I've pretty much been a full time parent

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.350
 the whole time that I've been a full time professor and I really love

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.720
 my job.
