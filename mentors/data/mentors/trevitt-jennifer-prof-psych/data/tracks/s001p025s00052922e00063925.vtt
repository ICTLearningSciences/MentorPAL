I think somebody who I really have always admired um is my grandmother.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:14.860
 She's actually she's passed at this point, but, um, she was she was

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:21.860
 really, really smart and she waas just always finding new things to

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:28.860
 Dio. She was really creative. She worked hard to be the best version

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:35.860
 of herself and to, you know, always improve her skills. And so she

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:42.870
 was. She was really a very hard worker, but she was also just incredibly

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.870
 unfailingly kind and patient. Um, she never shared unkind thoughts

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:56.870
 about anybody, and I'm sure she had them, but she just never shared

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:03.880
 them. And I really admire her dedication and her commitment Thio

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:10.880
 really being the best version of herself that she could be.
