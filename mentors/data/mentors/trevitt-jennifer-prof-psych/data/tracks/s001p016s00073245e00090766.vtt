00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.610
mhm. So M and s degree M A and M s degrees are both masters degrees. So

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.370
 Emma stands for Master of Arts and M s stands for master of Science.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.130
 And while sometimes there's some logic in this usually things that

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.890
 maybe you're in, like humanities or arts or music those were going

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.650
 to be M a degrees master of arts degrees. Whereas Degrees Master's

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.410
 degrees in, like, biology and chemistry, um are going to be masters

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.170
 of science degrees. Um, but sometimes it's kind of arbitrary. So, for

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.930
 instance, in our graduate program in the psychology department at

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.690
 Cal State Fullerton, we have both an M A and an M s degree. And so the

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.450
 M A degree is usually the track that's taken by people who want to

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.220
 do research, uh, maybe to work in a lab or maybe to go onto a PhD

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.980
 degree and then, you know, also be doing like, research or being an

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.740
 academics. Where is the M s degree is for people who want to go on to

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.500
 be clinicians, usually as like a license, marriage and family therapist.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.260
 Um, so it's you know, in that case, you might think, well, the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.020
 people who want to be scientists are getting a master of arts degree

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.780
 and the people who want to practice the art of clinical psychology.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.540
 You're getting a master of science degree. So again it could be a

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.300
 little bit arbitrary. But that's really the difference is it's a master

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.060
 of arts or it's a master of science.
