00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.010
the salary for a professor can can Very, pretty widely. Um, it's usually

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:11.180
 I would say probably between how I'm bad at this, and it changes

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.340
 I should mention with inflation. Eso You know, I've been in my position

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.510
 for almost 20 years now. And so the salaries that people were hired

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.670
 at when at the time when I was hired were much lower than the salaries

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.840
 at which incoming new professors are being hired at now. And

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.000
 And every, um, every raise that we get, we essentially get to raises

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.170
 throughout the course of our careers. So you get hired and you work

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.330
 for, I think, five years, six years, something like that. And then

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.500
 you go up for, ah, promotion from associate or sorry, Assistant professor

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.660
 to associate professor. And that is when also for us, you get

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.830
 tenure, and that's a salary bump when you get that promotion, and then

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.990
 the next promotion that you can get is Thio from associate professor

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.150
 to full professor. And that's another salary bump at that point.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.320
 And that's pretty much it e mean there are other. You can get other

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.480
 raises and things like that for merit or for whatever but e I mean,

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.650
 honestly, being being in a state university system, um, you know, we

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.810
 have had I remember years where we didn't even get cost of living

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.980
 raise is because the budget was the state budget was so tight. Um, so

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.140
 the way that I think about it is that you know, there's really just

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.310
 two times that you get a raise, and that raises a percentage of whatever

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.470
 your starting salary waas. So it can make it difficult to say,

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.640
 like, what's the average salary range for professors? Because a lot

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.800
 depends on essentially, how long they've been professors and what

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.970
 what was the going rate when they were hired. And so, for instance,

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.130
 one of the things that sometimes happens within departments is you get

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.290
 this weird kind of like lopsided, um, situation where people who

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.460
 have been teaching people who have been professors for you know, decades

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.620
 are actually making less than new brand new professors just coming

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.790
 in. And the reason for that is that you know, the people who have

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.950
 been teaching there for a really, really long time were hired at a

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.120
 point when the starting or base salary was a lot lower. And while they

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.280
 may have been getting raises throughout their careers, there's mainly

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.450
 those two and their a percentage of whatever salary you started

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.610
 at and so you can get to, you know, even 10% raises. But the cost

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.780
 of living has gone up, or inflation or whatever. And so the new people

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.940
 who are being hired are being hired at this much higher base salary

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.100
 rate, and they have to do that to be competitive. You can't offer,

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.270
 you know, really low salaries and expect to get any candidates who

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.430
 want to come to your school. So so for the hiring of the new people

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.600
 they have thio offer competitive salaries. And so then you get this

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.760
 situation where you have newer people who come in on are making mawr

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.930
 than people who have been there for 30 years, and that can be kind

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.090
 of weird and awkward sometimes. But that's part of working at a state

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.260
 institution. I think is that you know, we're really our budgets are

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.420
 limited by the state budget, so you know the range. I think I'm gonna

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.590
 say anywhere from $70,000 to $130,000. I think 100 30 is probably

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.750
 pretty high. I think most professors are closer to, like the $100,000

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.920
 mark, Um, per year, But honestly, I'm not I'm not entirely sure.
