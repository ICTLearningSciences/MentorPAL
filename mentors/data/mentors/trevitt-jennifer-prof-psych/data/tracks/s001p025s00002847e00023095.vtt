00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.420
As far as I know, psychological cities are not required to have any specific

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.980
 representation at all. So they don't have to represent equally

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.550
 by gender. They don't have Thio represent equally by ethnicity. Um,

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.120
 or anything like that. Um And one of the reasons for that is that,

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.690
 you know, depending on the question that you're asking you, you may

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:34.250
 not want Thio sample. You know, a very diverse population. You may

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.820
 want to be sampling a very targeted population. Um, I do know, however,

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.390
 that there are movements within psychology. Uh, for certain studies,

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.960
 Thio increase the diversity of their sample populations or their

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.520
 their sample the groups that they're gathering data from so and and

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.090
 this isn't just on ethnicity within ethnicity categories, but it's

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.660
 also within, for instance, gender categories. So So for me, one of

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:13.220
 you know I'm in neuroscience and I study, you know, kind of more biological

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.790
 functions, and I do a lot of my experimental work in with animal

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.360
 models, and the standard for forever has been to study psychological

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.930
 phenomenon in white male rats. And so a big part of the movement

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.490
 in my field is thio start including females in the kind of like early

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.060
 experimental data process or research process, Um, and so that

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.630
 may be reflective of other areas of psychology where there's kind of

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.200
 more attention being paid to the diversity of the subjects from which

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.760
 data is being gathered. But as far as I know, there are no hard and

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.330
 fast requirements.
