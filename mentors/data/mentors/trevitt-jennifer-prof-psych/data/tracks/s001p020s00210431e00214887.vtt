00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.420
I think one of the best things that you could do to make yourself competitive

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.990
 in the job sector is Thio Accumulate experience during your

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.560
 educational time. Eso you know, working in fields that are related to

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.130
 kind of your ultimate career path goals, um, or working with professors,

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.700
 um, in an academic setting or research setting. Those are things

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.270
 that can provide experiences that, you know, other students who

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.840
 were applying for those jobs may not have, and so that would make your

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.410
 particular applications stand out.
