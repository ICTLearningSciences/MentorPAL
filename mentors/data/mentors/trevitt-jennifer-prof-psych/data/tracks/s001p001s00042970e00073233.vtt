00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.300
what it's sometimes hard to estimate how many hours I work, like either

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.760
 per day or per week. Um, I kind of live by the academic calendar.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.210
 And so it's a It's a larger time scale, really. Andi, their their periods

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.670
 within that timescale, where there's just a ton of work to be

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.120
 done and there just aren't enough hours in the day. And then there are

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.580
 other times where it's a little more quiet essence on dares not,

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.030
 you know, as much to be done, and it's a little bit easier. Eso You

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.490
 know, for instance, at the very beginning of the semester, when I'm

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.940
 getting sure they're making sure that all my classes air ready to go

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.390
 everything on our you know, the online course sites air together and

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.850
 where they need to be, the lectures, air all prepared. The assignments

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.300
 are all kind of like ready to get going. Um, that's a that's huge.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.760
 That's a lot of work. And it's just, you know, long days, Andi.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.210
 Also, at the very end of the semester, we're in finals and, you know,

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.670
 just doing a ton of grading, wrapping up the semester, getting everything

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.120
 kind of filed and put away and put to bed. Um and actually also

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.570
 kind of like laying the groundwork for the coming semester. That's

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.030
 also very, very, very busy. Time on Ben within this semester itself.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.480
 They're different times like it just sometimes it depends on the

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.940
 rhythm of the class. So, you know, I in all of my classes, I have students

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.390
 writing papers. So when I get a stack of 40 papers, that's gonna

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.850
 be ah, long week. So that's gonna be a week where there's just

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.300
 a ton of grading and every spare moment that I have. I'm just grading

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.760
 all the time. Um, if I don't have a paper due that week and any of

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.210
 my classes, it's probably gonna be a lighter, weak, And I'm not gonna

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.660
 have a much on Ben waken layer on top of that. The research that

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.120
 happens So sometimes if we're in kind of, ah, data collection mode,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.570
 that's just, you know, kind of trickling in as we, you know, meet with

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.030
 people or do things like that. Once we have the data, then we go

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.480
 in tow, analyzing mode and writing up mode. And those were much more

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.940
 intense modes. And there's just lots more hours, and they're happening

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.390
 really fast. So, you know, with all of these different algorithms

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.840
 kind of layering on top of each other, it's really, really hard toe

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.300
 estimate. How many hours a week I work? Um, you know, I really don't

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.750
 have a good feel for it. Sometimes I think like a lawyer, like I

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.210
 should everything even when I'm in the shower. And I'm thinking about

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.660
 like, what am I going to do with this research program that I should

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.120
 be? You know, counting that is work. But, you know, I don't do that.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.570
 The point is just to get it done. So whatever it takes to get it

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.030
 done, do it. Some days are easier than others and thoughts about it.
