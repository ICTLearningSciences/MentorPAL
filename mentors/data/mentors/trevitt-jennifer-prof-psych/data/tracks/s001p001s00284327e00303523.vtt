00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.940
one of the things I really love about my job is that it provides a lot

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.030
 of flexibility. A zloty as I get things done when I get them done when

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.120
 I do them is pretty much, for the most part, up to me. I mean, there

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.210
 are some things that I have to do at a certain time, but most things

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.300
 were pretty flexible. Um, and what that means for me is that,

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.380
 you know, it does give me that ability to pursue other things that I

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.470
 want to dio, um, you know, hobbies that I want Thio engage with places

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.560
 I wanna go, people I want to see. Um, I could do all of those things

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.650
 and still be able Thio do my job. So I do feel like I get I get

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.740
 ample time thio pursue other things that I find fun and interesting.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.830
 It definitely goes by the season, So, you know, when we're in the

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.920
 middle of a semester, you know, when the spencers in season than it

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.010
 is usually much more work focused unless, like, you know, hobby and

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.100
 entertainment focused, but, um, during the winter break during the summer

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.190
 break, I think I have a lot of flexibility in a lot of time. Um,

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.280
 Thio do things that that I want to dio. But even during the semester,

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.360
 you know, I mean, I'm not working like 9 to 5 in an office. Eso

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.450
 you know, if I'm not teaching or if I don't have a scheduled meeting,

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.540
 it's really up to me. What I do with my time again, it's task based.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.630
 I have things that need to get done. Um, but I have a lot of flexibility

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.720
 in terms of when I do that. And so that allows for me Thio

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.810
 engage in other activities that I also find, um, rewarding.
