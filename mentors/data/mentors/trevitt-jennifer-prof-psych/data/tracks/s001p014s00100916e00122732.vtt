00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.610
So this is kind of like your professional handshake. Really? Um, you know,

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.380
 this is your first impression, and research shows us that first

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.140
 impressions are hard to shake. So you want Thio? Be sure that you are

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.910
 presenting yourself in the best possible light. So this is, you know,

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.670
 you're gonna dress nicely. You're going to look polished and professional.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.430
 Um, this is the time where, you know, you're maybe going

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.200
 to be a little bit more conservative in in how you present yourself.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.960
 Um, I think that you want Thio demonstrate that your personal, um,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.730
 that you can, you know, think on your feet that you're quick witted.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.490
 Um, and you know that you have some basic social graces practice having

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.260
 a good handshake. That's really important. Um, it's kind of surprising

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.020
 sometimes how often students don't pay attention to that. And

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.780
 it actually does make up impression on people. If you don't have

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.550
 a good handshake. Eso so practice that, um, you wanna practice interviewing

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.310
 again? The Career center is an excellent resource for this.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.080
 Uh, they could do videotape interviews. They could do mock interviews,

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.840
 and they can You can play it back and critique and they could be

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.600
 like, See, when you did that, that was really good. And, you know, see,

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.370
 when you did that, don't do that s o. I would definitely, um, use

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.130
 that as a resource in prepping for an interview. Um, particularly

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.900
 so right now is this is being filmed. We're in the middle of the cove

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.660
 in 19 pandemic eso. A lot of things are happening virtually right

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.430
 now, Andi, that includes things like job interviews. And that's a different

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.190
 context than a lot of people are used. Thio and so prepping

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.950
 for virtual job interview, uh, may look a little different than prepping

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.720
 for a regular face to face interview. And so these air also things

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.480
 to keep in mind of the context of the interview that you'll be having.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.250
 And again, the Career Center could be really helpful with this.
