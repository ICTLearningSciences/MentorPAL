00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.930
There are a couple of ways that I have to manage. Um, anxiety. And one

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.010
 of them is Thio. Watch what I eat. So I have just noticed in my own

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.090
 life that when I am eating a lot of sugar that that really feeds my

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.170
 anxiety. Eso I try thio eliminate as much sugar as possible for my

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.250
 diet. And and that really goes a long way towards just kind of reducing

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.330
 my baseline levels of anxiety. Um, I also use exercise and breathing

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.410
 breathing exercises, so physical exercise and breathing exercises

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.490
 for kind of like more like short term immediate management of anxiety.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.570
 And both of those techniques work really, really well for me.
