00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.560
I think that the field of psychology is probably one of the more welcoming

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.260
 and in affirming, um, fields for l g B T Q plus individuals. Um,

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.970
 just because that's kind of part of what we do is be aware of the

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.680
 fact that people are different, Andi, that there are many ways to be,

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.380
 um so I think that that that's true now, does it mean that we are

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.090
 absolutely affirming and welcoming? No. And and we definitely have room

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.790
 for improvement on on that point. Um, but But I do think it's probably

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.500
 one of the more welcoming fields.
