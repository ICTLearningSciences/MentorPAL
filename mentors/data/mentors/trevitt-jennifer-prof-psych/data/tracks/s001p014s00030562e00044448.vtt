00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.150
so good. Communication skills are really important, not just in psychology,

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.450
 but you know, in a lot of different areas of life. So if you do

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.740
 not if you know that you don't have good communication skills or if

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.040
 you think your communication skills could be better, that's definitely

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.340
 something that you wanna work on. Um, you could do it very formally

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.640
 there. You know, people who specialize in this and you can pay

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.940
 people toe make you into a better communicator. But there are other

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.240
 ways to go about it, too. So, for instance, like speech and debate,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.530
 like people who do speech and debate really learn how to talk to other

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.830
 people in a variety of contexts. Um, and most universities have,

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.130
 like a speech and debate team that you can join and you will learn,

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.430
 like, you know, methods of communication. Um, you can visit a therapist

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.730
 and say, you know, I need to work on communication skills and they

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.030
 can help you with that. You could just talk to your friends and say

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.320
 I want to get better at communicating, and, you know, maybe you have

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.620
 some ways that you want to do that, and you can say, Can you help

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.920
 me? You know, can we have some conversations about topics and, you

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.220
 know, let give me feedback on how I'm communicating with you So there's

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.520
 a lot of ways to improve your communication skills. There are a

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.820
 lot of books out there that you can read about improving communication

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.110
 skills, So, um, I would definitely try to improve those. If you

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.410
 think that that's an area of weakness for you, it'll be time and effort

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.710
 well spent.
