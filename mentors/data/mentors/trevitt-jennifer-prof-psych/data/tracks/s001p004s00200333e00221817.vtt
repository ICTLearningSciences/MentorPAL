00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.240
So I am married Teoh, a man named Brian. And he and I met when we were

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.640
 both doing our PhD work. So in graduate school, um, and he was actually

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.030
 a year behind me. Um, and we were great friends all through. We

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:22.420
 weren't We weren't together as a couple or anything through grad school.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.820
 We were just really, really good friends. Everybody thought we

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.210
 were together, but we were not together. We were just friends. And

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.610
 we hung out all the time because we liked all the same stuff. And it

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.000
 wasn't until I actually finished my PhD and had gotten a job in California

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.390
 at U C I and was ready to leave that all of a sudden we were

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.790
 like, I'm really gonna miss you like I'm really gonna miss you. And

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.180
 that was when we kind of realized that there was maybe maybe something

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.570
 a little bit more going on there. And of course, all of our friends

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.970
 were like, You are both morons. Because we saw this coming a mile

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.360
 away. Anyways, we were both slow on the uptake. So we got married.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.750
 Um, he actually managed to also get a job out in California. He actually

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.150
 got a job at U C L A. So he was working at UCLA. I was working

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.540
 at U C. I and we got married. And then we both got our first real jobs.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.930
 Uh, right a year within a year, getting married, we both got our

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.330
 riel jobs. Um, he got a job with the pharmaceutical industry and I

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.720
 got a job at Cal State Fullerton and then a little bit over a year

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.120
 later, we had triplets, and we have two girls and one boy, and that

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.510
 was it for us. We were We were one and done. So my family now is my

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.900
 husband, Brian, my three Children who are now 15 years old. We have

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.300
 also dogs and cats and chickens and a bunch of other things that I have

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.690
 to keep alive.
