00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.410
Yeah, this could be really tough. Um, you know, sometimes it's really

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.970
 hard to tell. And I will say at the outset, graduate school is hard.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.530
 There's a reason that not everyone is walking around with a graduate

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.090
 degree. It's because it's tough. And so I myself, even though now

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.660
 I look back on it and I really feel very fortunate that I went to the

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.220
 program, that I went thio, that I worked with the people that I worked

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.780
 with. Um, there were still times during that process or where I

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.340
 was like, I have made a huge mistake. I have. This is a disaster. I

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.900
 have totally gone down the wrong road here. So I think that, you know,

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.460
 having those moments of self doubt and and feeling like I made the

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.020
 wrong choice. That's very normal. Now, if you're feeling that way

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.580
 all the time for long periods of time, then yeah, you might want to

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.140
 pay attention to that and, you know, and that's where my second piece

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.700
 of advice comes in. Which is that if you have really determined that

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.270
 this is not the right place for you to be, stop walk away, quit

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.830
 and walk away. Do not stay and spend mawr of your time and money in

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.390
 a program where you are incredibly unhappy or don't feel that it is

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.950
 serving you. You are not doing anybody any favors by doing that, least

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.510
 of all yourself. But, you know, having those times of doubt, I think,

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.070
 is very normal in a process like graduate school, where it's just

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.630
 it's really tiring. It's very stressful. You know, you're gonna feel,

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.190
 really, you know, type stress out all the time, and it's very easy

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.750
 to feel like you've made the wrong choice. Um, you know, if you're

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.310
 feeling that way, take a break. See if you can take, like, a week

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.880
 off, or maybe just a couple days off to kind of catch your breath and

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.440
 sit for a second with yourself. And if you feel better than chances

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.000
 are, you're probably just kind of feeling really overstressed, Um,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.560
 but if you don't feel better than that may be a sign that this is

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.120
 not the right path for you anymore.
