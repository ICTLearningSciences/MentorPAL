00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.880
okay. Staying focused could be difficult for me. Sometimes I tend to have

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.920
 what I think of as my monkey mind where I'm doing one thing. And

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.950
 then it's like, um squirrel eso. I found that when I'm getting that

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.990
 way, when I'm getting really distractible, usually that's a sign that

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.020
 I need Thio. Either drink a glass of water or I need to eat something

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.060
 or you just need to move around for a little while. So that's the

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.090
 first thing I do when I find myself getting really distract. Easily

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.130
 distracted is I'll try to address something like that. Um, if I'm

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.160
 having trouble focusing, maybe because I'm just not really interested

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.200
 in what I'm doing right then, um, that could be a little bit harder.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.230
 And in that case, what I like to do is I like Thio set a timer for

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.270
 myself. Um, this is sometimes called the Pomodoro technique, and

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.300
 you can look up. You can look it up on Google. It's It's a very easy

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.340
 technique where you essentially have you write down a list, a list

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.370
 of tasks, and then you literally set a timer for yourself and you just

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.410
 say I'm going to get much done is I can, in this amount of time and

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.440
 the time could be whatever you want it to be. It could be an hour.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.480
 It could be less. Um, but I usually set a timer for an hour, and I

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.510
 just say, I'm gonna work for an hour. I'm going to get us much as I

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.550
 could get done. And when the timer goes off, I'm going to take some

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.580
 time off. Um, and a Zoff. It is not. What I find is that by the time

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.620
 the timer goes off, I've kind of found my flow again, and I'm into

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.650
 what I'm doing and then I don't want to stop. Thank you.
