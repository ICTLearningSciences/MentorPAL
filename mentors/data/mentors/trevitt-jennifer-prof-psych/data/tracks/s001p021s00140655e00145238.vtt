If you are feeling discriminated by other students on campus, you should

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.030
 report that to the dean of students and let them take it from there.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.130
 Um, you can also report, you know, feeling discriminated against

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:21.220
 Thio your professors, you can report that to the dean or the chair

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.310
 of the department or the dean of the college. Um, but I would definitely

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.400
 mention it to somebody in authority because if you're experiencing

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.500
 this, chances are there are other students who are also experiencing

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.590
 this, and this is something that the administration needs to be

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.680
 made aware of.
