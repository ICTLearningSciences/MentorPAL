WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.780
the campus of Cal State Fullerton is located in Orange County, which is

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:12.710
 traditionally considered to be a fairly conservative county, uh, in

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.650
 in the United States. But I think that, honestly, anytime you're looking

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.580
 at a an educational institution, um, they tend to be more liberal.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:30.510
 Um, also, we have a very high percentage of minority students

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.440
 that were we qualify as a minority serving institution, which I think

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.370
 means that over 50% of our student body is is comprised of minority

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.310
 students. Andi, that also tends thio indicate a more liberal, uh,

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:54.240
 campus. So So I think that Cal State Fullerton is probably a fairly

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:00.170
 liberal campus.
