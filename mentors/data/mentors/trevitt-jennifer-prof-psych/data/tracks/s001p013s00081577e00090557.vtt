00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.380
in general, I would look for professors who have been teaching the class

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.910
 that you're interested in taking for a while. Um, generally, we get

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.430
 better the more class sections we've had, we get a chance to fine

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.960
 tune our teaching methods. Andi, with experience hopefully comes wisdom

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.490
 and you kind of learn how to do things optimally. Eso I would look

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.020
 around at that also just different. Teachers have different teaching

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.550
 styles. So you may wanna ask around Teoh. You know, your peers

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.080
 and fellow classmates on DSI. You know what teachers they've enjoyed

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.600
 and ask them specific questions? Like, What was it you liked about

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.130
 this teacher or the way they taught, as opposed to just like, you know,

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.660
 who should I take and leave it at that?
