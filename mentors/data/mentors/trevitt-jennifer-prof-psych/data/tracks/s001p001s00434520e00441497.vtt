00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.810
I generally attend W P A, which is the Western Psych Association conference.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.770
 Every year with my students. Occasionally, I will attend a P

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.730
 A, which is the American Psychological Association annual meeting. It

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.700
 kind of depends on where it is. I used to attend the Society for Neuroscience

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.660
 Meeting, which is an annual meeting, but I haven't attended

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.620
 that in a while because my research focus has changed a bit.
