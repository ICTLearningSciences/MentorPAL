00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.710
It's great. I love being a psychologist, although I do think when most

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.560
 people ask me that question, the what they're thinking about is that

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.420
 I am a clinical psychologist. So, like I'm a therapist or a counselor,

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.270
 and I am not that at all. Um, I am a research psychologist, and

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.130
 specifically I am a neuroscientist. So I study the brain and how it

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.980
 works on how it influences certain behaviors. But and I love my field.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.840
 I love learning more about how the brain works and how it does all

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.690
 the amazing things that it does. Um, but I am definitely not a therapist.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.550
 I they it's probably not a good idea to leave me alone with

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.400
 the people for too long. I'm not good with, um S O. I much prefer the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.260
 research world.
