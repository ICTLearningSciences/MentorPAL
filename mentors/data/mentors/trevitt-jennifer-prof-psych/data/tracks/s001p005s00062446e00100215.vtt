00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.800
the time it takes to finish the degree is based on first of all, what

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.740
 degree we're talking about. And then, second of all, what? What you're

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.690
 doing for that degree. So a bachelor's degree generally takes 4 to

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.640
 5 years for most students. And, of course, there's, you know, people

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.590
 on either side of that. So some people can take a little shorter,

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.530
 some a little longer. But most people are going to take between four

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.480
 and five years to finish their bachelors degree. Ah, master's degree

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.430
 is generally going to take anywhere between two and three years,

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.380
 and then a PhD degree is generally going to take somewhere between four

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.320
 and six years, and the differences in all of these degrees why there's

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.270
 kind of a range has to do with exactly what you're doing. So,

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.220
 for instance, if we're looking at the bachelor's degree, some majors

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.170
 require mawr classes than other majors Dio, and so those majors just

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.120
 may take a little bit longer for someone to complete all the classes

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.060
 that they need. Um, same thing is true in a master's program. Generally,

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.010
 they take two years, but some programs require more work. They

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.960
 require, uh, different classes and maybe the classes are offered

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.900
 all the time. So again, that can add to the length of time in the degree

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.850
 program. When we're looking at like a PhD degree, Um, oftentimes

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.800
 that's going to depend to ah ah, large extent on the type of research

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.750
 that you are engaged in as a PhD student. So So, one of the requirements

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.690
 the biggest requirement of the PhD degrees that you contribute

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.640
 something new Thio the, uh, in terms of research. So you have to

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.590
 do like a new study with new data and show something knew that adds

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.540
 to the field. And so depending on the kind of work that you're doing

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.480
 that can really affect your time, um, to finishing the project and

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.430
 getting your degree. So, for instance, an example of this Is that

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.380
 the lab that I got my Ph. D. N? We did behavioral work, uh, in in rodents

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.330
 and our studies went pretty quickly. So they lasted, you know,

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.270
 maybe a couple months. You know, a long study would be a study that

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.220
 lasted maybe four months, something like that on dso It was possible.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.170
 Thio, you know, do ah whole research program, essentially in a relatively

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.120
 short period of time. And so I ended up getting my PhD in a

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.070
 almost exactly four years. And then when I went thio work at U. C I

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.010
 in the lab there, I you know, I already had my PhD at that point. But

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.960
 the graduate students who are working on their PhDs in that lab,

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.910
 the way the research that was being done in that lab took a lot longer.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.850
 So they were doing, um, work that required waiting for stains to

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.800
 emerge in various tissues, usually brain tissue on. I mean, it could

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.750
 take four weeks for Thio, even see if the stain worked out right.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.700
 So So the students in that lab, one of them took five years, and one

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.640
 of them took six years to get their PhD work done. And that's just

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.590
 because the type of work that they were doing had just a much longer

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.540
 time course. So there can be some variability there
