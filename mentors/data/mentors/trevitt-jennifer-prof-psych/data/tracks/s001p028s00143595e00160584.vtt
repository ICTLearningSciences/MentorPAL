00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.340
dealing with anxiety can be really tough. Um, I do think that there are

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.840
 a few things that can benefit most people. One thing that I think

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.330
 can really help manage anxiety in the long run is to pay attention to

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.830
 what you are eating. Pay attention to what you're putting in your

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.320
 body. In particular, sugar really feeds anxiety. Um, and so you know,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.820
 if you can limit the amount If you were gonna change your diet in

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.310
 one way, I would say that's the way to do it to limit your sugar intake.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.810
 Um, other things that can really help Thio reduce anxiety are participating

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.300
 in physical exercise on a regular basis, and it doesn't

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.790
 have to be strenuous exercise. It could just be a very mild walk for,

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.290
 you know, 5 to 10 minutes. If you could do that every day, I think

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.780
 you'll be surprised how far that will go towards reducing your anxiety.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.280
 Um, there are also other things that you could do, like breathing

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.770
 exercises and maybe meditation or yoga or something like that. Um,

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.270
 that that can really help Thio kind of control anxiety in the moment.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.760
 Breathing exercises in particular, I think are very, uh um Good

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.260
 for for that kind of that immediate kind of reducing anxiety. Um, but

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.750
 yeah, there are a lot of things that are available to you to reduce

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.250
 anxiety. And honestly, I would just try everything you can think

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.740
 of and see what sticks, see what actually works for you.
