00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.870
e think a class that I wish I had taken that I didn't take waas. Maybe

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.890
 a beginning nure Oh, science class. I took bio psychology, which maybe

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.920
 was kind of like a beginning neuroscience class, but it was really

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.940
 more focused on the field of psychology. Neuroscience is a much broader

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.960
 umbrella. Um, and so I didn't really learn all about the different

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.980
 aspects of neuroscience until I was in graduate school. Um, and

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.000
 and at that point, it was almost expected that I had more knowledge

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.020
 about this than I did. And so I kind of had to do some quick ketchup

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.050
 work. Um, Thio kind of really appreciate the broadness of the field

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.070
 of neuroscience. So it would have been nice to have had kind of much

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.090
 earlier on, like, maybe even at the bachelor's level. I just kind

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.110
 of, ah, basic neuroscience class.
