00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.810
so paying for graduate school or the cost of graduate school, I should

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.770
 say, is going to depend a little bit on the program that you go thio

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.730
 or the type of program. So if you're going to a master's program,

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.690
 generally you're going to have to pay tuition and you know, fees and

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.650
 books and things like that. Um, sometimes there are positions that

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.610
 are offered in master's programs for master's students in that program.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.570
 So being an assistant to a professor, for instance, or working in

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.530
 a computer lab, you know, I would check with the department itself

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.490
 and see what graduate student positions are available to help you offset

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.450
 the cost of getting your degree, Um, for a PhD program. Oftentimes

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.410
 it depends on the type of program that you go to So in psychology,

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.370
 if you're going to go into a clinical psychology PhD program, oftentimes

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.330
 you're like a professional psychology PhD program. Oftentimes

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.290
 you are gonna have to pay for that out of your own pocket. It's kind

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.250
 of like medical school andan that case, you know, you could probably

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.210
 get grants or loans. Maybe, um, I wouldn't count on working sometimes

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.170
 with some of these programs, they're kind of built for the working

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.130
 professional. Um, but a lot of them, you really need to be a full

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.090
 time student and not just a regular, full time student, but a full

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.050
 time student in a PhD program, which is kind of like that's a lot

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.010
 of hours. It's not gonna leave you much time. Thio hold another job

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.970
 outside of being a student. So probably you're going to be looking

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.930
 at grants or loans at that point. Um, however, if you go into a research

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.890
 based PhD, oftentimes those programs are actually gonna pay you

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.850
 to be a student, because the work the work you're doing in terms of

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.810
 research is actually valuable work. Um, And so if you're working in

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.770
 someone's lab and doing research for them, they will pay you. You will

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.730
 get paid, um, either by them specifically by whoever you know lab

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.690
 you're working in or more likely through the department that that

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.650
 lab is located in, um and oftentimes also like tuition and fees might

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.610
 be waived. Um, eso So depending on the kind of graduate degree you're

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.570
 looking for, you may find that you don't have to pay for it or at

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.530
 least not pay for all of it s so it's definitely something that you

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.490
 should look into.
