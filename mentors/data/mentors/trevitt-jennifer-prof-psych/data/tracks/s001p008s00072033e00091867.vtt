00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.000
I think the challenge is the most. I mean, there were a lot of challenges.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.140
 There were just, you know, the workload was a lot, you know, going

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.290
 to being a student and working, even though I mean, I was only working

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.430
 part time, so even that was a lot for me. Um, I think another

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.580
 struggle was watching. This was especially true when I got into graduate

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.720
 school, um, watching my friends and peers who had, you know, gone

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.870
 from a bachelor's degree into a career path. And so they were now

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.010
 developing their careers, and I was still in school. And so, you know,

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.160
 they were starting to make money and by cars and, you know, have

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.300
 nicer apartments and go on vacations and do things like that. And

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.450
 I was still in, you know, starving student mode. And that was that was

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.590
 tough. Teoh kind of stay the course because I saw the, you know,

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.740
 like how well my friends were doing in their jobs. Um, I'm glad that

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.880
 I did stay the course. I'm glad that I didn't quit and, you know, go

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.030
 chase the money. Um, the money has come, and I'm very happy doing

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.170
 what I'm doing. Um, and I can't say that That's true for all of my friends

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.320
 who who went into careers, you know, maybe, like right out of

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.460
 the bachelor's degrees. Um, there, you know, maybe they're making money,

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.610
 but maybe they're not making as much money as they need to be

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.750
 happy, I guess you could say, And that's because they're not super excited

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.900
 about what they do every day. You spend a lot of your life doing

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.040
 your career and so to me, I am so glad that I took the time Thio

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.190
 get me to a career that I really, really enjoy doing.
