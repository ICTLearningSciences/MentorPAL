00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.210
So when I was growing up, I wanted to be a lot of things. I wanted to

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.560
 be a ballerina because I was a young girl growing up in America. So

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.920
 I think that was a pretty standard one. Um, I wanted to be a cowgirl.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.280
 I wanted to be a singer, even though I can't sing. But that's okay.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.630
 Details A Z. I got older when I was in high school and starting to

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.990
 kind of consider careers. Um, I wanted to be ah, lot of different things

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:38.340
 the U 19 or the unifying factor in all of the things that I wanted

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.700
 to be where they were things that would, uh, make me very, very

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.060
 rich. I think what I really wanted was freedom, Andi. I saw I saw money

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.410
 is a means to that. So I just I didn't really care what I was.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.770
 I just wanted to have a lot of money. Um, so I was gonna be a lawyer.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.130
 I was going to be, uh, senator, Like, I was going to go into politics,

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:10.480
 um, business for a half second, because that never really appealed

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.840
 to me, but it didn't seem to be lucrative. Um And then when I got

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.190
 to college, we had thio. So when I went to college, I started my college

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.550
 journey at San Diego State University, which is part of the CSU

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.910
 system down in San Diego. And at that time, the university was really,

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:37.260
 really impacted. And so you had to declare your major as a freshman.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.620
 Most universities are not going to require you to do that because,

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.970
 of course, who knows what they want to dio when they're just starting

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.330
 college? Some people do, but most people don't so But the time

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.690
 at San Diego State you had to declare a major right off the bat.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.040
 So I didn't really know what to declare. Um, so I kind of chose my major

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.400
 based on some other factors. So number one I didn't like math,

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.760
 and I didn't like science, so I didn't. So all of those majors went

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.110
 right out the window. Then I wasn't. I liked art, but I wasn't super

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.470
 artsy. Um, you know, like music. But I didn't know anything about music,

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.820
 so I didn't think I would do well in those things. So those went

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.180
 out the window and I liked history. But Then I looked at the course

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.540
 requirements and there were a lot of classes that I would have to

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.890
 take that I was not really interested in. So I was like, um so I actually

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.250
 finally settled on psychology as my major. So I went into college

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.610
 as a psych major. But the reason for that was not because I was

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.960
 particularly interested in psychology. The main reason for it was that

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.320
 it was kind of a science, but not like biology or chemistry or physics

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.680
 kind of science. And my dad had been on at the time Waas a clinical

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.030
 psychologist. And so, you know, growing up, that was always a

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.390
 topic at the dinner table, you know, and he had a private practice.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.740
 And so, you know, we talked a lot about psychology and psychological

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.100
 constructs and things like that. Also, I waas. I was a delightful

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.460
 adolescent who knew everything. And so my reasoning went that my dad

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.810
 was an idiot and he could do this so clearly, this would be something

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.170
 very easy for me to dio. So that was essentially why I picked psychology

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.530
 as my major. Now that said, fast forward into my college experience.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.880
 I switched majors, and I'm gonna put that in air quotes because

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.240
 I never actually filed the paperwork to do it. So my whole college

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.590
 career I'm on record is being a psych major. But in my mind, I changed

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.950
 my major probably six times in the first two years of my college

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.310
 career. And really, it kind of went it was based on the teachers

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.660
 that I had. So when I had a class, that Haddon amazing teacher, I was

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.020
 like, This is it. This is what I'm doing with my life. Absolutely.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.380
 I found my passion and my calling. And so I was a geology major for

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.730
 a while, I waas, uh, going to major in foreign languages for a while,

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:50.090
 and then I was going to be an interpreter for the u. N. That was

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.440
 that was a plan. Um, I was gonna be a history major. I was going to

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.800
 be an English major, and I think Oh, I said geology. So yeah, so those

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.160
 are the ones that I remember off the top of my head, but oh, anthropology.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.510
 I was gonna be an anthropology major for a while. It pretty

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.870
 much changed a couple of times each semester, and it really was based

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:22.230
 on the teachers that I had. So the the short answer, I guess to

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:27.580
 this question is that I wanted to be a lot of things when I was growing

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.940
 up, and the thing that I am doing now is something that I never,

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.290
 ever, ever thought I would be doing, and yet I absolutely love it.
