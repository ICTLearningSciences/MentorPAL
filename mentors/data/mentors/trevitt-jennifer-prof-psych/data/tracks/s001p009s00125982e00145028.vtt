00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.870
When I was in my bachelor's degree, I thought about changing my major.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.890
 I almost every week, I think, and I kind of did. I just didn't do it

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.910
 like I didn't follow the paperwork, but in my mind, I changed my major

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.940
 at least eight times. Um, so I really wasn't even settled on psychology

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.960
 until the very end of my bachelor's degree. Pretty much, um

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.980
 And then when I was in, um, in my PhD program, I remember I almost

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.000
 left. After a couple of years. I was just It was hard and I was over

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.020
 it, and I was living in a place that was very different from any place

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.040
 I've ever lived before. So I was on the East Coast. It was winter,

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.060
 it was cold and I was done. And so I remember talking with a friend

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.080
 of my mentor who was like a recruiter for biotech companies. And

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.110
 he said, So are you ready to quit and open a restaurant? And I was like,

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.130
 How did you know? And he's like because everybody gets to that

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.150
 point S O. I was like, OK, so I ended up staying on. But then even then,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.170
 after I got my PhD. I was planning to go into the pharmaceutical

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.190
 industry because one of my, you know, main areas of studies is pharmaceuticals

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.210
 or psychopharmacology. How drugs affect the brain and behavior.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.230
 And so my plan was to go into the pharmaceutical industry and

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.260
 kind of work on that type of research. Um, and then I ended up getting

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.280
 a job in academic position and ended up falling in love with it.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.300
 So I mean, all throughout my career, I have changed and changed and

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.320
 changed and changed.
