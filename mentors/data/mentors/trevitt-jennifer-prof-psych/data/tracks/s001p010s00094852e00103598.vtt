00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.160
I think your best chance for being successful in this field is Thio. Look

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.480
 at all the different areas within psychology and see what really

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.790
 ignite your passion. Uh, it's so much easier to taken information and

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.110
 retain it when it's something that you are truly truly interested

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.420
 in. So I would not necessarily follow the academic track that you think

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.740
 is going to reward you with a high paying career of the end of

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.050
 it. I would I would instead advise you to just pick up a basic psychology

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.370
 textbook and skim through it and see if there's any, uh, domains

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.680
 within psychology that just really get you excited and you want to

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.000
 know more about that. And that's the track that I would say you're

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.310
 gonna be most successful on.
