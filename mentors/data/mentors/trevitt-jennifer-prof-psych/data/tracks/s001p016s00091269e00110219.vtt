00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.060
So a PhD is in psychology, kind of the more traditional degree. So so,

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.280
 way back in the day, the doctors, uh, philosophers were kind of like

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.490
 the thinkers. And so a doctor of philosophy was was a degree that

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.710
 was earned by people who, uh, made their living thinking. Um and then

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.920
 there was the medical degree, and that was more of like, a practitioner

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.140
 type of degree. So these were people who made a career out of

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.350
 healing people or making people better. Um, and so the PhD was also

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.560
 very much a research based degree in psychology. Um, but clinical psychologists

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.780
 aren't spending their careers generally doing research.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.990
 They're spending their careers, you know, practicing clinical psychology,

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.210
 which is you can kind of think of it in that sense, like an M.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.420
 D. It's more like a healing degree. They're working with clients. Um,

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.640
 eso Assaidi reflects that Assaidi is really designed to teach up

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.850
 and coming clinical psychologist how to practice clinical psychology,

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.060
 whereas a PhD is still kind of designed in that traditional model

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.280
 where what you're doing is a lot of research and you're learning theory.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.490
 And while that could be helpful for people who ultimately want

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.710
 to become clinical psychologist. Um, you know, Assaidi actually, in

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.920
 some ways is better training for them because they're actually learning

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.140
 how to practice clinical psychology just as medical doctors learn

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.350
 how to practice being doctors while earning their M D degree.
