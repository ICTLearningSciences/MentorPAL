00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.330
you can absolutely pursue careers outside of psychology with a psychology

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.800
 degree. In fact, most people who graduate with a bachelor's degree

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.280
 in psychology are not working in the field of psychology. They're

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.750
 working in other fields. They're working in business. They're working

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.230
 in education. They're working in arts and entertainment. But psychology

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.700
 gives you that skill set to work with people because you understand

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.180
 people better. And so that's why it's such a great major because

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.650
 it applies to so many fields.
