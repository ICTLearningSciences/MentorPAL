00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.670
I think I had a pretty good childhood. Um, my parents were good people.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.480
 My dad was a clinical psychologist. He worked a lot. He was He really

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.300
 loved his work. Um, so he was kind of doing that most of my early

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.110
 childhood. And then, um when we when my mom and my brother and I moved

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.930
 to Hawaii, that was that was a little traumatic. We didn't know

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.750
 anybody there. I mean, she had some people there from when she had

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.560
 lived there as a child. Um, but her parents, my grand parents who didn't

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.380
 know very well because they lived in Hawaii way didn't see them

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.190
 that often, but they had both died, Um, and so she had, like, old friends

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.010
 of families, But that was about it. So none of us really knew

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.830
 anybody. So it was kind of like starting over again. And I had to go

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.640
 to a new school. Um, but, you know, I got over it. I made friends,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.460
 and then I grew up in Hawaii, and it's funny, because people sometimes

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.270
 when they hear that they're like, Oh, my gosh, you grew up in Hawaii.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.090
 It was really wasted on me. as a kid. It was just kind of like,

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.910
 This is the place I grew up. Eso it had good things and bad things.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.720
 You know, we spent a lot of time at the beach. We spent a lot of time

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.540
 outdoors. Um, but it was also, for me, a little confining. So, for

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.350
 instance, when I finished high school, my Onley objective at that

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.170
 point was to leave Hawaii and go someplace else. Um, my brother, on

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.990
 the other hand, loves it. And he would actually live there right now

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.800
 if he could. But it's really, really expensive to live there, so it's

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.620
 not really practical. Um, so I think All in all, I had a good childhood.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.430
 I had good friends and close family and, you know, some some

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.250
 minor bumps in the road, but nothing, nothing too bad.
