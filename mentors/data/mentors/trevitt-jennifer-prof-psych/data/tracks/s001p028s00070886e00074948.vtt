I know that there are certain things that you have to dio. I believe there's

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.880
 a prescribed course of study, like a pre med course of study.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.390
 And you have to take the M cat on bond. Then, of course, you have to

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.900
 apply to medical school. Um, other than that, I am not the person

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.420
 who has that information. So I would probably talk Thio someone maybe

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.930
 in the career center, Um, maybe somebody in the biology department,

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.440
 because I think that the pre med course of study falls in the biology

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.960
 department. Um, but I I don't have a ton of details on that process.
