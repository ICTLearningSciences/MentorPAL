Yeah, I think probably your best bet is to go to the career center. They

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.470
 have a ton of resource is at your disposal. Um, they get job postings

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.280
 from all over the place, like they get local job postings. But

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.090
 they also get from national companies. Um, they're kind of just a repository

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.890
 of job postings. They also have search engines. So even if

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.700
 they don't get the posting directly, they have engines that help you

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.510
 search for, you know, specific types of jobs in specific areas of the

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.320
 country. Uh, not just locally, So I would absolutely go to the career

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.130
 center first.
