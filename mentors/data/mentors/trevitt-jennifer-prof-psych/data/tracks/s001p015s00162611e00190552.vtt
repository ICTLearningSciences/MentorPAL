00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.400
there are a couple of different ways that you can pay for graduate school.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.960
 Um, one is that you can somehow get money. Um, you can either get

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.510
 loans, which you have to pay back, But generally there is a fairly

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.070
 low interest rate. Um, and usually the the payback terms are, um,

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.620
 pretty easy. Um, although you may end up paying quite a lot back Soto

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.180
 really look into it about, you know, if you paid you know so much,

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.730
 it's such an interest rate. How long would it take you to pay the loan

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.290
 back? And then what would be the total amount that you paid versus

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.840
 the actual amount of the loan? That's math worth doing. If you are

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.400
 in in that situation, do that math. Um, you can also sometimes get

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.950
 grants and grants are great because you don't have to pay him back

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.500
 grants or just kind of like money free money on dso. I would work with

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.060
 the financial aid officer at the school where your program is house

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.610
 because oftentimes you know there may be grants that you're not even

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.170
 aware of. Um, there are a lot of societies that offer grants that

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.720
 are not really well publicized, so people don't know about him. So

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.280
 definitely take a look at all the possible grants that you can get.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.830
 And if you could get a grant versus alone, Absolutely. Get a grant.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.390
 Um, the other thing that you can dio is you can work and you can make

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.940
 money. Um, now, in general, when you're going to graduate school,

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.500
 your primary job is being a student. And graduate schools are generally

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.050
 set up as full time programs, which means you cannot do them part

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.610
 time. Eso. The expectation is that you are a full time student, Um,

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.160
 and you know, that's really serious. And in graduate school, you

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.710
 know, it's a higher level of class work, and so you're going to be working

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.270
 harder. It's going to be more difficulty. Just the material itself

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.820
 is going to be more difficult thing what you experience in your

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.380
 bachelor's degree. So having a job during graduate school can sometimes

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.930
 be tricky. It's not impossible, Um, but it can be kind of difficult.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.490
 So, you know, these are things to consider as you're looking

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.040
 at financing graduate school. Most of the people that I know who went

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.600
 through graduate school did it with a combination of all three of

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.150
 these things. So they had, you know, they got some grants, but they

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.710
 also took out some loans and they might have had, you know, a job or

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.260
 something like that.
