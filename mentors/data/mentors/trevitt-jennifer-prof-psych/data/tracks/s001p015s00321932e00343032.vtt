00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.530
the Jerry is kind of like the s a T for grad school. Um, so it z ah, higher

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.210
 level of, um questions and and knowledge assumed that compared

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.890
 to the S A. T, which is the college entrance, Uh, it's the same kind

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.560
 of stuff they're looking at just kind of your general linguistic abilities.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.240
 Both, you know, writing, reading comprehension, all of that

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.920
 stuff. They're looking at your quantitative abilities eso, mathematics

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.600
 and science and things like that. Um And then oftentimes, there's

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.280
 a specialty exam that goes along with whatever domain you are wanting

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.960
 to study in during graduate school. So there's like a psychology

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.640
 Jerry test on a biology Jerry test. Eso you would take the one that's

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.310
 that's relevant. Thio your discipline. Um, and to do well on it,

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.990
 Honestly, it's one of those tests where you need I think the best thing

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.670
 you can do is learn how to take the test eso just like the S a

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.350
 T. There are certain rules with the jerry in terms of like, how much

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.030
 you're penalized for wrong answers. And so there are certain strategies.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.710
 Um, for you know, if you're not sure about the answer to a question.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.390
 Do you answer it or not? And it kind of depends on like how Maney

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.060
 answers you can narrow it down to. There's a lot of different test

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.740
 taking strategies for the G R E. Fortunately, there's also a lot

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.420
 of books on the G R E the that air relatively inexpensive or just available

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.100
 at the library. Um, and you can take a look at them and see

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.780
 the different test taking strategies. Oftentimes, they often have,

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.460
 like practice tests, they have practiced exercises that cover, you know,

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.140
 some of the more common information that regularly appears on the

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.810
 G R E. Um, they also have special books for, like the various subjects

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.490
 within the subject tests eso You can do a lot of prep for the

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.170
 G R E, but I would focus your prep on literally how to take the test

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.850
 as opposed to the information that's contained on the test
