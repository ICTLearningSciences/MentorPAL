00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.950
explore a ZMA TAS. You can take different classes and see what rings true

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.050
 to you. See what ignites you. It may not be what you think it's

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.150
 going to be. So let yourself stay open to the possibilities. And then

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.250
 once you find something that captures your interest, pursue it. Follow

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.350
 it down that path a little bit more and see if this is really something

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.450
 that you like. If you let yourself be driven by your own innate

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.550
 interests, you will probably end up in a career path that is really

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.650
 satisfying to you.
