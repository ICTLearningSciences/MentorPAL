minors aren't required, but they can be really helpful depending, especially

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.510

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.160
 either biology or in chemistry might be really helpful to you, particularly

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.490
 if you wanted to go on to either graduate school, um, or get

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.820
 a job in like the biotech industry.
