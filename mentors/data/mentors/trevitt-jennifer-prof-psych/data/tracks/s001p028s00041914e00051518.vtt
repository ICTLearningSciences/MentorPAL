00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.160
that is such a cool question. And the truth is, nobody really knows. Um,

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.470
 I think that the definition that I like best is the decision of whether

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.780
 something is normal or abnormal totally depends on the context.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.090
 So it's kind of like the definition of a we'd like What's a weed?

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.400
 Well, a weed is a plant that's growing where you don't want it to grow,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.710
 so it doesn't matter. The plant itself is immaterial. It's the

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.030
 context of the plant and so arose. Growing in a cornfield is a weed,

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.340
 and I think the same kind of applies to, you know, just general generalities

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.650
 about normal and abnormal things that are abnormal or things

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.960
 that are not appropriate in a given context. And that context may

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.270
 be very, very specific. So it's really hard to just say generally like

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.580
 This is abnormal. There aren't many things, if anything at all,

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.890
 that falls like into that heading
