procrastination is tough. It is hard to stop procrastinating. I think

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.350
 for myself, the reason that I find myself wanting to procrastinate is

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.600
 because whatever the task at hand is, it seems too big and I can't

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.850
 I just I can't do it. And so I found a useful strategy in that case

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.090
 is to break that task down into much smaller items. And if I can just

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.340
 get a couple of those done, it really helps with my motivation to

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.590
 then continue on and tackle the rest of it. So that would be my advice

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.840
 is Thio break big things down into small pieces? Andi, just try

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.090
 to get a few of those pieces done like maybe every day or every week,

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.340
 Or, you know, however, it fits your schedule.
