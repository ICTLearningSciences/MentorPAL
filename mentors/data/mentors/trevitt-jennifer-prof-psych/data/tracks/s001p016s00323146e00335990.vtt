00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.270
Yeah, it really depends. Some students don't take on any loans. Eso You

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.690
 know, some students who are going Teoh, a program that fully funds

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.120
 them and provides for low cost housing and stipends. And things like

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.540
 that may not have to take out any loans at all to go to graduate school.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.960
 And so they will emerge from graduate school completely debt

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.380
 free. Other students do have to take out loans. Onda again. How much

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.800
 they have to take out in loans just really depends on a lot of different

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.230
 factors, you know, oftentimes, including where they're living

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.650
 in the country. So if you're going to graduate school in Kansas, for

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.070
 instance, your cost of living, just you know how much it costs to,

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.490
 like buy groceries or rent an apartment is probably going to be significantly

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.910
 less than if you were going to graduate school in Los Angeles,

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.340
 California. Um, so there's a lot of different factors that are

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.760
 gonna affect this. And so it's really hard to say that, you know, the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.180
 average PhD student goes this much into debt because it's very individualized.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.600
 Personally, I have a lot of friends that have gone, you

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.020
 know, they have Ph. D s. Andi. I know a couple of them who didn't incur

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.450
 any debt going through their PhD. I also know a couple of them

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.870
 that air literally to this day. Still paying off student loans. Eso

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.290
 it really just depends.
