00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.960
I think it's it's time management, that is, that's a really big part.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.060
 And that's one that I just I feel like I continuously struggle with.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:16.170
 Or at least maybe struggle isn't the right word, um, that I have to

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.280
 keep returning to, and I have to keep figuring it out on baby. It's

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.380
 because it changes. And so the time management strategy that worked

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.490
 for this particular time is not working for this other particular time.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.590
 It may be something like that, Um, but I feel like that is always

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.700
 an issue. Is managing my time effectively, Um, making sure that I'm

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.810
 using my time as profitably as I can so that I'm getting everything

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.910
 that I need to get done done in a timely manner. Um, and and here's

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.020
 the key is just and not have it turned me into a total stress case.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.130
 Um, so usually I could get what I need to get done done when I need

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.230
 to get it done. But I'm not a fun and pleasant person to be around

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.340
 during the process, so that's kind of the part that I'm working on

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.440
 with the time management is being able to get it done and still be

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.550
 a relatively decent human being. At the same time,
