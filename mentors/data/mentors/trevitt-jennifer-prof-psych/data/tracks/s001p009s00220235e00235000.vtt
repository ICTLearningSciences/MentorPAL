00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.520
Yeah, Being in a PhD program to this day was one of the hardest things

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.180
 I've done one of the most difficult experiences of my life, but also

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.850
 one of the absolute best experiences of my life. So I do remember

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.510
 sitting on my living room floor. This is about Midway and I was having

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.180
 I was I was just like, What am I doing here on? I remember sitting

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.840
 on my living room floor and just balling and crying because I had

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.510
 I had no idea what I was doing with my life. I was The pressure was

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.180
 tremendous. I was working like, you know, 12 14 16 hour days. There

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.840
 were literally nights that I slept in the lab. We had a couch and I

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.510
 would just sleep there because I was working almost all through the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.170
 night. It was ridiculous. Um, on the other hands, some of my best friends

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.840
 to this day are people that I met during that PhD process, including

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.510
 my husband. That's where we met was in graduate school. We were

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:20.170
 in the same lab. Um, and I have memories of so many fun time, So

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.840
 many adventures. We had exp flooring the you know, the area around us

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.500
 hiking, canoeing, having parties, you know, going camping. We had

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.170
 so much fun. I also have really good memories of, like, the people who

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.830
 were in my lab. We had wonderful times together. And so it was, you

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.500
 know, it was the best of times. It was the worst of times.
