00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.750
There have been a lot of people who have influenced me throughout the

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.650
 course of my life and my career. Um, if I'm just looking at my life

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.550
 over all, not with particular emphasis on my career I would say that

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.450
 my greatest mentors or influencers have been, um, my grandmother who

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.350
 taught me how to be creative, um, and kind of see the world in, ah,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.250
 slightly different matter. Like, how can I do this? She was really

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.150
 smart and, um, always looking like, you know, how could we make this

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.050
 happen? And so I think she really passed that down to me. Um, my mom

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.950
 for showing me what it looks like. Thio kind of buck expectations

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.850
 of what your life should be and toe lead your own life the way that

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.750
 you want it to be. She was the first woman in her family who attended

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.650
 college number one and actually finish college after she had married

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.550
 my dad and her whole family was like, What are you doing? Like you?

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.450
 You got what you were supposed to get by going to college. You got

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.350
 a husband like why do you need to finish this process and she was

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.250
 like, because I want to have a college degree. And so she did Onda.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.150
 That was, you know, very characteristic of her entire life and then

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.050
 my stepmother. Because So she began her career as a nurse and then

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.950
 ended up. She worked for a nurse's for several years, went back to school,

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.850
 got her master's in public health and then started doing work

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.750
 in terms of, like, administration within, like, health care. She was

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.650
 the vice president of the hospital for a while. She ended her career

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.550
 like ending or running a clinic. Uh, you see, a medical center, Um,

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.450
 and all of this was while she was raising my younger brothers. And

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.350
 so she has been really influential to me. Um, in terms of how to kind

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.250
 of handle, you know, having a family and a career, both of which

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.150
 are very meaningful to me.
