00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.780
a few mistakes that I often see students make are taking too many classes,

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.720
 given the other things were happening in their lives. So, for instance,

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.650
 of students are working a lot of hours, you know, taking 12

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.590
 to 15 units may not really be reasonable for them, especially if they

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.520
 have any other commitments, like family commitments or, you know,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.450
 friends or things like that. So I think taking on too much not being

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.390
 realistic about your actual available time and energy and putting

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.320
 things off until, for instance, there do so I, for instance, have papers

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.250
 in my class, and I can't even tell you how many times students

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.190
 will turn in papers late because they waited until the last minute to

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.120
 start it. And then, you know, the Internet went down or some other

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.060
 calamity happened. But the thing is that the paper assignments are

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.990
 available on the first day of class, and so not, you know, not doing

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:09.920
 things in a timely manner and kind of procrastinating, and then trying

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.860
 to catch up with the end, I think, is not a good habit to get into
