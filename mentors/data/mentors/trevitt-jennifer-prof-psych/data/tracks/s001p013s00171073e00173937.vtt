That is a great question. And to be honest, I am not entirely sure of

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.400
 the step by step process for doing that. But what I would do is refer

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.170
 you to the psychology, advising office or possibly even just the psychology

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.940
 department office. Um, I think that the people who staff those

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.720
 offices would be able to guide you step by step through that process.
