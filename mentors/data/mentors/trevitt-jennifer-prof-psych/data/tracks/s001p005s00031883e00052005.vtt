00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.620
I would have to say that the best area of or branch of psychology to study

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.390
 is bio psychology, and that may be because I love it. And I'm biased.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:18.170
 Absolutely. That's probably why I'm saying that. But I truly,

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.940
 truly believe in my heart that bio psychology, that understanding that

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.710
 we are biological entities and therefore all of the amazing things

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.480
 that we dio all of them, like just from simple stuff like choosing.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.260
 You know, Thio, eat this instead of this or go right instead of left

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.030
 all the way up to writing symphonies and building, you know, bridges

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.800
 and all of these crazy things that we dio all of this. All of this

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.570
 is based in the fact that we're biological entities and we are.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.350
 That is where everything that we do comes from, and so understanding

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.120
 how that biology effects, all of the things that we're capable of doing

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.890
 is hugely important. And I feel that this is the direction that

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.660
 psychology, just as the whole field is kind of going towards and it

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:27.440
 will become more biological and more biological as we go along. And

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.210
 I mean, if we look at psychology from the 18 hundreds to now. I mean,

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.980
 it's completely more biologically centered than it ever waas back

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.750
 then, and I think that trend is on Lee going to continue. And so for

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.530
 that reason, I would argue that biological psychology is the most

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.300
 important domain within the overall field of psychology. But I do admit

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.070
 that I'm probably biased.
