00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.200
When I was doing my bachelors degree, I was a member of PDS A. And once

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.550
 I got my g p a up. I was a member of psych. I, um In fact, I think

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.900
 I might have served as, like, treasurer or something for psych. I I

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.250
 think I had a like, a new officer position for that. Um, in my master's

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.600
 degree, I wasn't really in, you know? I mean, I was a graduate

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.940
 student, and all the graduate students kind of had their own little

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.290
 like it wasn't, but it wasn't an official club, but we were just kind

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.640
 of all in the same cohort. Um, And then when I was doing my doctoral

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.990
 work, I was a member of the, um, psychological Graduate Student Society.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:54.340
 Um, and I think that was it. I don't think I did a lot of other

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.690
 clubs
