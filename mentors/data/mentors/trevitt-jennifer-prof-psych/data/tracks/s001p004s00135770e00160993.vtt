00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.570
When I started college, I started at San Diego State University, and at

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.290
 the time the university was impacted, which meant that they had too

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.020
 many students, and so their policy was to have students declare their

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.740
 major as incoming freshmen. So as soon as you started there, you

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.460
 had to declare a major. And so I didn't know really what I wanted to

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.180
 do with that point. But I had to pick something, so I e chose my major

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.910
 really, by a process of elimination. So I looked through the catalog

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.630
 at all of the available majors, and I decided, you know, I didn't

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.350
 want to do anything that had to do with math because I didn't like

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.070
 math. I didn't want anything to do with science because I didn't

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.800
 like things like chemistry and stuff like that. So all of that stuff

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.520
 just went gone out the window on gun I you know, I wasn't really good

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.240
 at art or music. So those you know, I didn't consider those p No,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.960
 thank you. I wasn't gonna do anything like that. So, you know, kind

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.690
 of as I went through and just toss things, the pool got smaller and

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.410
 smaller. Um, And then once, I kind of had a few choices, mostly in

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.130
 the humanities and social sciences. I started looking at the requirements.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.850
 Andi also just kind of thinking of my own abilities. Like, could

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.580
 I really do this on Guy? Honestly landed on psychology Mawr. So

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.300
 not so much because I loved psychology and wanted to know more. My father

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.020
 was a clinical psychologist, and so we had always, you know, I

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.740
 knew a lot about psychology just from dinner table talk kind of stuff.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.470
 Um, and so I just kind of plumped on that major because I knew something

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.190
 about it. It was reasonably interesting, I guess. Andi, I I

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.910
 definitely felt that well, if my dad could do it, and you know he was

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.630
 an idiot because I was that kind of kid. Um, then I could do it.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.360
 So that was really what made my decision to choose. Psychology is my

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.080
 major
