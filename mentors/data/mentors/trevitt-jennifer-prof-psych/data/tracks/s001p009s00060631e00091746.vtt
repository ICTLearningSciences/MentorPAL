00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.880
That is a great question. And it's a really long and winding story. Um,

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.910
 my career path or trajectory from kind of like when I started, let's

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.940
 say in college and now is not a linear process. It all, um or at

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.970
 least not a straight line. Um, if I had to maybe isolate some key decisions,

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.000
 that kind of got me to where I am now, I think that the first

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.030
 one probably would have been taking that taking the bio psychology

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:36.060
 class when I was still working on my bachelors degree. Um, I had entered

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.090
 psychology initially, just kind of with the assumption that I

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.120
 was going to be a clinician. Um, but honestly, my heart really wasn't

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.150
 in it. I much preferred, you know, like, kind of like biology and

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.180
 those types of things on dso. When I took the bio psychology class,

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.210
 it was this this wonderful marriage of biology and psychology, and

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.240
 that was the class that really just set me on fire. And I was like,

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.270
 I need to know more about this. Um, now, unfortunately, I took that

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.300
 class literally the spring that I was supposed to graduate. So I was,

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.330
 like, done with my bachelor's degree at that point. And so here I

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.360
 waas like, this is what I want to dio but I don't know anything about

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.390
 it. And so I ended up enrolling in graduate school and first I was

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.430
 in a master's program, um, and learn more about it, and that made me

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.460
 just love it even more. And so at that point, I decided I wanted to

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.490
 keep going with my education. And that was probably the second big

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.520
 decision that I made was I'm going to pursue ah ph. D in bio psychology

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.550
 Neuroscience. Um, so I did that and, you know, learned even more

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.580
 about this amazing field and consistently was inspired and just loving

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.610
 what I dio eso I finished my PhD degree. I took a job in a postdoctoral

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.640
 position. Um and then I would say the next day Biggest piece

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.670
 of the puzzle. Waas. Some one of my mentors encouraged me. Thio apply

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.700
 Thio Cal State Fullerton. They were looking for someone to teach

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.730
 bio psychology and she encouraged me to apply, and honestly, at the

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.760
 time, I wasn't really interested. I was I was in the middle of a big

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.790
 project that I was very engaged in Andi. I wasn't looking. Thio become

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.820
 a teacher anyways. Um, but she said she just advised me like, Just

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.850
 do it. Just do it for the practice. If nothing else, just get you.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.880
 You're gonna be on the job market soon, so just get used to interviewing.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.910
 And this is great practice for you. And so I did. I put my

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.940
 application together and I applied, and I actually did get a call back

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.970
 and an on campus interview, and I went and I ended up getting the

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.000
 job, and that was that, and that's that's how I got here.
