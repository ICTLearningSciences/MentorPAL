00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.340
writer's block is the worst. I hate it. Hate it. I hate it. I hate it.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.820
 Um, the way that I deal with Writer's block is to try to switch into

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.310
 editing mode, so I takes. And sometimes what this means is that I

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.800
 take something that I've actually already previously written, and I

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.290
 begin editing it. And something about being in that editing mode kind

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.770
 of makes it easier for me to then switch into the writing mode where

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.260
 I'm actually creating. Now, instead of just editing something that's

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.750
 already there s Oh, that's a trick that I've used, um, with success

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.230
 in the past is to start out in editing mode and then transition

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.720
 into writing mode.
