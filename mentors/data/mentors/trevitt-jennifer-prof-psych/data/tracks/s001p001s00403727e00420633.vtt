00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.210
So right now we're actually kind of in the middle of the pandemic. Eso

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:13.570
 the struggles that I am encountering right now mainly have to do with

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.930
 trying number one trying to teach in an online format which is not

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:26.300
 a format that I am used. Thio. And it's honestly not a format that

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.660
 I really like e really like face to face classes. So that's been a

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.020
 bit that's been a big struggle for me. Um, the other struggle is my

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.380
 research. My research has shut down. I can't gather data anymore. And

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:51.740
 so it's really kind of limiting what Aiken Dio. And until we get the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:58.100
 all clear and we can go back, you know, I need to be interacting

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.460
 with either people or with animals in order to collect my data. Um,

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.830
 and until we can go back to campus, that is not gonna happen. So I'm

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.190
 just kind of in limbo right now, waiting to see, um when you know waken

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.550
 resume doing research and also when we can resume doing face to

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.910
 face teaching
