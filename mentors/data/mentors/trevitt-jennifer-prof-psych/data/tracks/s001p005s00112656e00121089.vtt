00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.280
I conventions and conferences, we can. I present my research so I often

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.720
 go because I'm presenting new research. And conventions and conferences

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.150
 are great places to meet other colleagues generally, who are other

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.580
 places? Other universities, Um, and who are doing maybe slightly

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.020
 different things. And you're doing what? You're all kind of doing

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.450
 something around the same topic. Let's say s so it's a really wonderful

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.880
 opportunity to meet with these folks and hear about what they're

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.310
 doing. Present your data, get their feedback. Um, eso So it's a way

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.750
 that that scientists used to keep current on DNO. Kind of What? What

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.180
