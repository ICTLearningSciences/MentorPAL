WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.040
that decision is totally up to you. Um, I think that for those students

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.230
 I've had who've applied to graduate programs and haven't gotten into

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.420
 the ones that they wanted to get into or maybe just didn't get into

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.600
 any at all, um, most frequently what I counsel them to do is Thio

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.790
 pursue a job. You know, try to get a job in that kind of general area.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.980
 Eso again if they wanted Thio get into a graduate program, maybe

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.170
 a master's program for working with people struggling with addiction

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.360
 and they didn't get into any programs. I would say, you know, see

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.550
 if you could get a job working with recovering addicts or, you know,

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.730
 in that kind of general area of work and do that for a little while.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.920
 Number one. It's great experience. And it's really telling because

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.110
 you may find out that, you know, you just don't want to do this kind

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.300
 of work after all, because oftentimes what we think work is gonna

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.490
 be like is not exactly what it turns out to be. And so you may find

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.680
 that this is just actually not the job for you, which is super valuable

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.860
 information um, but maybe you find Yes, you are absolutely right.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.050
 This is your chosen population. You love working with this group,

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.240
 and you are more committed than ever to go toe graduate school and get,

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.430
 you know, in advance degree. And in that case, absolutely reapply.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.620
 Reapply to those same schools. If anything, your application is stronger

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.810
 now because you've got this fantastic experience behind you.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.990
 Now, um, and that and you're bringing that into the mix now. So you've

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.180
 got something that you didn't have when you applied initially, eso

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.370
 you absolutely can apply to the same program more than once. And

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.560
 remember, too, that sometimes the decisions about you know how many

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.750
 people a program except have nothing to dio with you or your application.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.940
 It has to do with funding. You know who may be the person in the

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.120
 program that you wanted to work with. They just don't have enough

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.310
 funds to take any students. Or maybe the person that you wanted to

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.500
 work with just doesn't have enough funds to take on another student.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.690
 But maybe they will next year. So absolutely try again
