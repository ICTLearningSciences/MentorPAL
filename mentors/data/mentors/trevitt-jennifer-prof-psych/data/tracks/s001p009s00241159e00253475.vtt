00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.470
I worked all through my bachelor's degree and all through my master's

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.090
 degree. Now, when I was working on my bachelors degree, I had a job.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.710
 I actually worked in a fabric store. Um, I like to so and so it was

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.330
 a great job for me, and I did that for the whole time that I was doing

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.950
 my bachelors degree on by worked. I think it was part time at that

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.570
 point, like between 20 to 30 hours a week. Um, when I joined the

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.190
 master's program that I went thio, I got a job in a computer lab in

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.810
 the department and I was also serving as a graduate assistant for one

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.430
 of the professors, So I was working, but it was kind of within the

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.050
 context of the university and the program that I was in. Similarly,

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.670
 when I went into my PhD program, I was you know, I was in a lab and

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.290
 doing work in the lab, And so with a lot of especially research based

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.910
 Ph. D. S, um, they actually pay you to go. So I didn't like all of

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.530
 my fees and tuition were waved. Um, and I was paid for doing the work

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.150
 that I was doing, the research work that I was doing. So so I didn't

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.770
 have a job outside of the department or outside of the work that

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.390
 I was doing, but I was supported by the work that I was doing in the

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.010
 lab.
