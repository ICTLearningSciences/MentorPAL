00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.680
professors are just regular people who know a lot about a particular subject.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.510
 So the best way to approach a professor is just thio. Be friendly

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.330
 and respectful and introduce yourself. Professors are used to

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.160
 students introducing themselves and asking questions. This is literally

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.990
 a part of our job. We are very busy and we may tell you I can't

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.820
 talk to you right now, but let's make an appointment for a later time.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.640
 But we're very used to students approaching us and wanting to ask

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.470
 us questions.
