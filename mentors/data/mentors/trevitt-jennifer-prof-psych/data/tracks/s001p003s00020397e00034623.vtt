00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.230
Jen is actually the name that my family and friends call me. And so, in

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.610
 my personal life, most people call me Jen. I do prefer that my students

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.000
 call me Doctor Trev. It and I used to think that that made me

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.380
 feel like it made me feel very stuffy inside to say, Call me Doctor

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.760
 Trev. It like, Who are you, lady? But a friend of mine who is also a

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.140
 doctor and an academic, pointed out to me that particularly for women,

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.520
 it's important for us. Thio claim our titles. Um, and part of the

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.910
 reason for that is that you know, if you don't see examples of female

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.290
 doctors, then particularly if you're a female, you may think that

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.670
 that is just not a possibility that's open to you. And even if you're

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.050
 not a female, you may just assume that females just aren't doctors

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.440
 because you haven't seen any of them. So that's the reason that I

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.820
 actually do like to have my want my students to call me doctor, um,

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.200
 to acknowledge the title because I want other students. I want to be

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.580
 an example. Thio future students that Yeah, I'm a doctor. I'm a woman.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.960
 I'm married. I have kids. I have pets. I have a car that you know

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.350
 I need to take and get fixed. Like I'm just a normal person. I am

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.730
 just like you. But I am a doctor. And so if I could be a doctor, you

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.110
 could be a doctor.
