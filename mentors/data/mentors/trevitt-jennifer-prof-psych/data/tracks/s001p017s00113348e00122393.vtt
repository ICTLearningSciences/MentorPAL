00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.460
Yeah, I think that the way that I set goals is by seeing what's the next

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.060
 step. You know, I'm kind of always trying to learn more, um, and

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.670
 trying Teoh, you know, show more data or show something more clearly

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.270
 with my data in my research. Um and so I find that that goals at this

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.880
 point for myself are pretty organic in nature. They just what do

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.480
 I want to do next? And then I kind of visualize that and then think

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.090
 about Okay. Well, what are the steps that I'm going to need? Thio due

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.690
 to get ultimately to this goal. And I just try to break it down, um,

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.300
 into manageable pieces.
