It depends on what you dio. So there is there, there, both of those things.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.480
 Psychology is a science. So we use the scientific method. Um,

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.800
 and a big part of what we do is gather data and then analyze that. And

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.120
 so that's kind of falling under the sub field of statistics and statistics

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.440
 is math. So So there there is kind of a need to have a basic

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.750
 understanding of math, but, ah, lot of statistics are really kind

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.070
 of on the level of just basic algebra. Um, so, you know, a long as

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.390
 you did pretty well in high school math, you should be OK. Um, also

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.710
 incidentally, some people who didn't really like high school math find

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.020
 that they really love statistics because even though the statistics

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.340
 uses the same operations is algebra. You're thinking about numbers

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.660
 in a different way that, for some people like me, makes a whole lot

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.970
 more sense. So I hated math in high school, but I love statistics,

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.290
 Onda. Same thing with science. Science is a process, and that's really

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.610
 the most important thing that you have to understand is just the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.930
 process of science. When it comes to actual like scientific facts like,

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.240
 you know, how does the cell work? That kind of knowledge is not

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.560
 as important for the general field.
