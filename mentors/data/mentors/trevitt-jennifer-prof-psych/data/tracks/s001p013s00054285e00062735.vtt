00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.300
so internships are a great way to kind of test the waters in different

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.750
 aspects of the field of psychology. So some people do internships that

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.200
 air at specific places, like maybe or working with certain populations,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.650
 like working with kids or working with older adults. Um, you

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.100
 could also, though, work in a research laboratory, like with a faculty

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.550
 member, and that will also fulfill your internship requirement.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.000
 So I would say, Look into what's most interesting to you, particularly

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.450
 in terms of like what you think you might want to be doing five years

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.900
 from now and see if you can find an internship that something like

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.350
 that, because it will give you a taste of that.
