00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.530
the lab or labs that you take are really going to depend on number one

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.210
 what you're interested in. And number two, what you think you might

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.900
 end up doing as a career, for instance? So if you think you might go

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.580
 into any kind of teaching career, um, you know, learning and memory

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.260
 would be a fantastic lab for you to take. Um, if you are going to

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.940
 go or, you know, cognitive lab might also be a really good choice for

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.620
 that, too. Um, if you're going to go into, you know, some feel like

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.310
 counseling or something like that again, Cog lab might be really good.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.990
 Uh, physio lab might be really good for that, too, because they

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.670
 cover, you know, kind of like how the brain is a physical thing and

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.350
 how it reacts. Thio various stimulate. So So I would take a look at

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.030
 just, you know, first of all, what do you what lab interests you the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.720
 most? Take that lab and also you can think about you know, what career

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.400
 path you think you might be on at some point and take a lab that's

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.080
 going to really support that career path
