00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.740
so it it kind of depends on a couple of things. So So One main way to

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.630
 distinguish one group of professors from another is essentially whether

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.510
 they are tenure, track or not. Tenure track. So not tenure track

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.400
 professors or sometimes referred to as adjunct professors. And so they

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.290
 are sometimes also known as part time faculty. But that is kind

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.180
 of a misnomer, because oftentimes they're working full time hours, but

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.070
 they're not on the on the career path to getting tenure. Uh, tenure

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.950
 is a special state that essentially protects the academic freedoms

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.840
 of professors. Eso professors who are on the tenure track of their

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.730
 career are sometimes referred Thio as a full time faculty. Um, and

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.620
 within the tenure track, there are three different ranks of professors.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.510
 There are assistant professors, which is usually what most professor

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.400
 start out with. So when you first get hired into a tenure track

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.280
 position, you are an assistant professor, and then you are promoted

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.170
 Thio, an associate professor, And that's about the same time that you're

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.060
 also promoted to having tenure. And then after that, you could

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.950
 be promoted to full professor, and that's kind of the last big promotion

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.840
 in the In the Professor world. Um, there's also additionally the

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.720
 rank of emeritus professor, which is given Thio professors that have,

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.610
 I think, technically retired, but they do occasionally teach classes.
