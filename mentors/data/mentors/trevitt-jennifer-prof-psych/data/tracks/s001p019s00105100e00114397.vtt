00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.740
So my dad was really into outdoors outdoor things and we went camping

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.620
 and hiking a lot as kids and his rule, always when we were out in nature,

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.510
 was leave a place better than you found it. And that's essentially

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.390
 been The motto of my life is I want to leave this place, this world,

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.280
 this wherever I am, better than the way that I found it. And teaching

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:36.160
 has been such a wonderful avenue for me because it really I

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.050
 do feel like with each student that I teach. I am leaving this world

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.930
 a better place than I found it, and so that gives me a lot of satisfaction.
