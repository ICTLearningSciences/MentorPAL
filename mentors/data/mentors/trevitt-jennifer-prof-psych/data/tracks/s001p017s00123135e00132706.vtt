00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.420
in five years. I think I'll probably still be pretty much where I am doing

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.990
 what I'm doing. Um, teaching, Doing research, Enjoying my career

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.560
 in 10 years. I don't know. I I mean, I I do see myself possibly on

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.130
 the point of retiring in 10 years. Um, and part of that is not because

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.700
 I don't wanna do this forever. I part of me does want to do this

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.280
 forever. Um, but part of me, I also have some plans for myself kind

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.850
 of a second career that I would like to devote some time Thio. And

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.420
 I wanna make sure that I have enough time in my life. Thio really devote

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.990
 to that second career. So I may be, you know, really starting to

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:56.560
 think about retirement. Um, 10 years from now.
