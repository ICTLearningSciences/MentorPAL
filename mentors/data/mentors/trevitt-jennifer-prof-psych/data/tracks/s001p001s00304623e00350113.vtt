00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.270
so I don't think most people go into academics to be rich. And if they

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.700
 do, they're probably not very smart. Um, teachers on at all levels

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.120
 are notoriously underpaid. Um, and I think that that's probably true,

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.540
 You know, for me, I You know, I definitely feel like I work very hard,

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.970
 Um, relative to the compensation that I receive. Andi, I think

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.390
 that if I was just in it for the money, I probably would have quit long

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.810
 ago because the compensation is just not there. Um, in terms of

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:44.240
 being able toe live on my salary, I think that depends on a lot of things.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.660
 I mean, number one, I live in Southern California, which is one

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.080
 of the most expensive places to live. And so, you know, given my

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.510
 salary Yeah, I mean, it would it would be really tight. My husband,

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.930
 I'm married and my husband also works. And so we're a dual income family,

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.350
 and that allows us thio afford the life that we have. Um, if he

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.780
 lost his job and we lost his income, um, I think we could make it,

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.200
 but I think that our lives would be very much different than they are

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.620
 right now. Um, on the other hand, I have a friend who is also a professor

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:33.050
 and works at a State University. But she's in North Carolina

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.470
 and she makes the same amount that I dio. But she essentially has

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.890
 more money than I dio because her dollars go much farther because she's

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.320
 in North Carolina. Eso if you look a, you know, housing prices.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.740
 If you look even that things just like groceries. Like, what's the cost

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.160
 of milk and what's the cost of gas? Um, it's much lower in other

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.590
 parts of the country. And so in Southern California in particular,

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.010
 you know, we're just we have a very high cost of living. And so every

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:16.440
 dollar doesn't go a Sfar. Um now that also, you know, what do you

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.860
 mean by making it? Well, I mean, that also depends on the lifestyle

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.280
 that you wanna lead. Um, my husband and I and our Children, we really

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.710
 enjoy traveling, And so we try thio travel a much as we possibly can,

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:38.130
 and we've gone to a lot of really great places of the family. We've

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.550
 gone to Scotland and we've gone to Bali and we've gone to Brazil,

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.980
 um, to name a few places. But we afford that by cutting back in other

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.400
 places. So, you know, we live actually pretty simply, um and and

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.820
 we use the money that we save from living simply thio put towards,

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.250
 you know, other things like travel adventures, eso it's, you know, it's

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.670
 kind of hard Thio say you know how much a given salary is gonna

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.090
 afford because it really just depends on the kind of life that you wanna

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.520
 live. If I wanted toe, you know, drive a really awesome fancy car

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.940
 and eat out all the time and wear designer clothes and travel and,

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.360
 you know, by a lot of stuff, then no, my salary would not allow for

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.790
 that. But for the life that I do live, um, you know, I would say that

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.210
 my salary is pretty good. I mean, I don't know about supporting,

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.630
 like, the whole family on this salary. Um, although again, you know,

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:54.060
 my husband and I have talked about it, and if his income was to just

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.480
 evaporate, which is possible because he works in the private sector,

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.900
 um, you know, it would be different and there would be things that

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.330
 we would definitely have to cut, but I think we could get by on my

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.750
 salary
