00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.300
one of the things I love about my job is that there really aren't average

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.750
 days. Um, there are average, maybe weeks, I would say, but every

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.190
 day is different. So on the days that I'm teaching, I usually teach

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.640
 classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays. And so on those days, most of my

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.090
 day is spent in teaching activities. So I'm either actually lecturing

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.540
 in a class or I'm holding office hours where I'm meeting with students

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.980
 or I'm working on lecture prep, you know, getting things ready

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.430
 for the next week. Usually, uh, grading falls into that, too. Um, so

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.880
 that's Tuesdays and Thursdays and then on the other days, Mondays,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.330
 Wednesdays and Fridays. Those are usually devoted mostly to my research.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.780
 So Monday is the day that I try to reserve to do a lot of writing.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.220
 Um, and then on Wednesdays, I'm kind of focusing more on, um, actually

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.670
 doing the research. Um, and then Fridays I have lab meetings,

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.120
 and I meet with, uh, my personal lab. Also meet with the with the

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.570
 fibromyalgia research group lab that that I work with Andi, then sprinkled

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.020
 also in those Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Our committee

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.460
 meetings, um those air, you know, happening all the time. Um eso really?

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.910
 When I look at my calendar, there's some kind of overall patterns,

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.360
 But honestly, every single day is unique. It's it's all a little

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.810
 different. And that's one of the things I really love about. My job

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.250
 is it never gets boring. I can honestly say that my job is never boring.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.700
 Sometimes it's overwhelming. Um, sometimes it's annoying, but

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.150
 it is never, ever, ever boring.
