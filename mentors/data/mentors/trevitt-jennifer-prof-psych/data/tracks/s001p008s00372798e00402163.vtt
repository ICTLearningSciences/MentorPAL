00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.670
so there's a lot of variability in salaries, depending on so many factors.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.500
 So I think in general it is true that the more advanced degree

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.320
 that you have, the higher your overall salary range, is going to be.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.140
 So. Usually people with PhDs are going to make more money than people

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.970
 who have master's degrees, who are going to make more money than

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.790
 people with bachelor's degrees. And that's just kind of like, I think,

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.620
 a general trend. It's not always true. Um, the other thing that's

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.440
 really going toe affect your salary range is what you're actually doing.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.260
 So, for instance, my husband and I have the exact same degree.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.090
 We worked in the same exact lab in graduate school, so we have a carbon

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.910
 copy of each other's degrees. He went into the pharmaceutical industry.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.730
 I went into academics. He makes I'm going to say conservatively

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.560
 four times what I make with the exact same degree. So what you

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.380
 do, I think, is probably the biggest factor that affects how much you

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.200
 make, which is, you know, that makes sense. So the question is, what

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.030
 do you want to dio like? If if you're if you're making this decision

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.850
 based on, like, a salary range, Like I You know, I don't want to

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.680
 do anything where I'm gonna be making less than a certain amount. For

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.500
 instance, I think the best way to figure out salary ranges is to

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.320
 narrow down the actual position that you see and a great place to do.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.150
 This is the career center. So if you go to the Career Center, they

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.970
 have so much information on different types of jobs or different types

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.790
 of careers, and you can look at those careers and see Okay, this

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.620
 seems like a good one. That seems like a good one. That seems like

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.440
 something I would be interested in. And then once you've chosen, like,

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.260
 a handful of careers, you can then you either through the career

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.090
 center or just through something like Google. You can probably find

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.910
 salary ranges for that type of position. So that would be if I was trying

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.730
 to figure out, like, okay, if I decided Thio leave my career and

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.560
 become a research assistant in a biotech lab. How much would I make?

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.380
 Well, you know, once I decided. Okay, this is what I want to do.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.210
 I want to do. I wanna be a research assistant in a biotech lab. I could

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.030
 then go onto the Internet. Or I could go to the career center and

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.850
 say, Okay, What? You know, what kind of salaries are you seeing for

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.680
 people in this position? And so that might be a really good way.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.500
 Thio kind of get some good data on actual salaries.
