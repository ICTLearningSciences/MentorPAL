00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.970
 it's for, like a master's degree, the content of the program. So are

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.350
 they teaching the things that you need toe learn. And for a PhD program,

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.730
 you want to look at content. But you also want to look at the

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.100
 research that's being accomplished in that program. So is the type of

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.470
 research that you want to be a part of happening in that program,

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.850
 and that's really how you should pick your PhD program.
