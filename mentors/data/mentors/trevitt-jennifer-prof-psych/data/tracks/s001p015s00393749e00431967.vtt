00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.680
How does a great question I'll be honest. I took the Jerry almost 30 years

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.510
 ago and it was a very different test back then. It was, I mean,

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.340
 wasn't administered on computers. So, like your next question was not

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.170
 dependent on how you answered the current question. Um, and they

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.000
 also scored it differently. So there were some kind of guideline cutoffs

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.830
 when I was applying. So so each. There was a quant and, um and

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.660
 ah, the verbal part. So verbal and quant. And then there was your subject

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.490
 test. And so the verbal in the quiet and they also had a logic

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.320
 section. So the verbal in the quant that we're both worth 800 points

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.150
 and so combined the kind of general idea was that you needed to have

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.980
 at least 1000 to get into, like, a master's level graduate course

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.810
 and at least 1200 to get into a PhD level. Uh, course of study, um,

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.640
 and so but they score it differently now, so I'm not really sure, like

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.470
 what modern day scores like, how that equivalents to the older scores.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.300
 And I don't even know if the cutoffs are still the same What

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.130
 I do know is that every program will list its average g R E score for,

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.960
 like, it's incoming classes. And so one of the things that you can

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.790
 dio is you can look around a different programs like Let's say that

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.620
 you're interested in industrial organizational psychology and you

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.450
 do a little research and you find, you know, maybe 20 schools that offer

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.280
 a degree, and you kind of look at their reputations and see how

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.110
 they how they are, Um, and then look at those schools and see what

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.940
 air their requirements for the G R E scores. And that's essentially

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.770
 what you want to shoot for is you want to shoot for the level that's

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.600
 required by the programs in schools that you are interested in. Um

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.430
 um, the other thing that I will say about the G R E scores is that a

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.260
 lo G R E score can definitely get your application like eliminated

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.090
 from the pool. And that's honestly, I think, the main purpose that they

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.920
 serve, um, this is an easy metric with which thio eliminate applications.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.750
 So if you've got 100 applications and you know you've only

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.580
 got 10 positions you want to find a way, thio easily go through those

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.410
 100 applications and get rid of the applications that you just know

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.240
 you don't want. Um and so one way to do that is Thio use g r E cutoffs

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.070
 and G p a cut offs. And so those are the big two that are kind

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.900
 of used for that first cull of applications. So a lo g r E score can

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.730
 hurt you, but conversely Ah, hi. Really. Hi, Jerry. Score isn't necessarily

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.560
 going to help you. I mean, it may prevent you from getting

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.390
 eliminated, but this is not going to get you into graduate school.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.220
 Like most people are not admitted to graduate school because they have

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.050
 amazing g r e scores. That's not what makes the decision. When it

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.880
 comes to the application, the application itself, the personal statement,

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.710
 the letters of recommendation usually count for more than a g

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.540
 r E score. But if you want to know, you know a number like I need this

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.370
 amount. My best advice to you is just to go to the schools and the

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.200
 programs that you're interested in, applying Thio and see what they're

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.030
 requiring
