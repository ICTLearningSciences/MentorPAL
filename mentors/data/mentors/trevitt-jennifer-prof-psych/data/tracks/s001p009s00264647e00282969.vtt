00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.280
I think the hardest class I have ever taken in my entire college career.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.720
 Waas The general level math class. When I was a sophomore, I had

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:17.150
 always struggled with math. I think I got through high school math mainly

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.580
 through pity. Um, I definitely didn't have the skill set on guy

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.010
 remember taking that general education math required? I think it was

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.450
 like 1 10 B or something like that. And I struggled so hard in that

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.880
 class and I had to pass it and that wonderful instructor that I had,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.310
 he was the best because he didn't just pass me out of pity or anything

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.740
 like that. Like I saw that guy in his office hours pretty much

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.180
 twice a week every week for an entire semester, and he worked with

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.610
 me diligently. I will honestly say that I still didn't have a great

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.040
 understanding of math when I left the class, but that was not due to

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.470
 him and the lack of attempts to teach me he spent so much time with

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.910
 me. I think that at that point, my brain was just not really in a

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.340
 place to accept that information. So, um, it was no fault of his. But

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.770
 I did manage to pass. I actually passed with a B minus. So that's

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.200
 credit right there to him. Um and yeah, but that was probably when I

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.640
 look back on just the class that I struggled with the most, that was

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.070
 the class.
