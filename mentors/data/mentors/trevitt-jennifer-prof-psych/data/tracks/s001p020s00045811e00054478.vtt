I think probably a good bet would be going thio either the career Center

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.180
 or to the financial Aid office. Because in addition to helping you

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.850
 process and apply for loans and things like that, they're also aware

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.520
 of pools of scholarship money and grant money that you can utilize

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.180
 for your education. You could probably also just do a Google search.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.850
 Andi, I know that there are organizations out there that kind of

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.520
 keep track of all of the available scholarship and grant funds for different

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.190
 areas of study. So you could just try simply typing into Google

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.850
 scholarship money for psychology majors and seeing what comes up.
