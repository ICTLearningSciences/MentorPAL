00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.690
I didn't really choose this career. I This was never my plan to be a teacher

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.520
 when I was in graduate school, working on my PhD. I envision

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.360
 my future as one of a researcher working in industry. So working for

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.200
 a pharmaceutical company, for instance, and, you know, doing research

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.030
 with various drugs and looking with a specialty in mental health.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.870
 Um, and I loved being in the lab. I loved being in the lab. I love

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.710
 doing. I love the process of research. Um, I loved it was just like

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.540
 a big puzzle to me. Like, how do we How do we do this? You know, we

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.380
 know we want to do. But how do we get there? And I really just love

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.220
 that, um, that kind of mental exercise of just figuring it out. So being

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.050
 a teacher was really never something that I envisioned myself being,

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.890
 um, So I I ended up getting the job at Cal State Fullerton, and

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.730
 I kind of went into it with the idea that, well, you know, we'll see

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:22.560
 how it works out. Maybe I'll do it for a couple of years, and then

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.400
 I'll pursue my industry, uh, ideas or pursue that path. And I was

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.240
 absolutely shocked by how much I loved teaching. I love teaching. I

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.080
 love interacting with my students. I love watching them learn. I love

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.910
 watching them see how they can take the information that they've learned

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.750
 my class and actually use it to change their own lives and make

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.590
 them better. That is, I love hearing their new ideas. I love being

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.420
 surrounded by smart people all the time who have fantastic ideas and

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.260
 want to share them like this. This is this is the life I leave. This

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:15.100
 is the life I lean. I am surrounded by brilliant people who think

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.930
 about stuff all the time and who are just bursting with new ideas.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.770
 And I I couldn't imagine another doing anything else. I absolutely

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.610
 love this job and yet I can honestly say I didn't choose it. It was

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.440
 never something I deliberately chose to dio. I am just really lucky
