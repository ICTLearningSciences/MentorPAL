00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.770
I think it's really neat, actually, that I am but alum because I feel

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.690
 that that I've had the experience of being a student at Cal State Fullerton.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.600
 I know you know some of the common problems that students have,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.520
 but I also know some of the, you know, the strength that our students

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.440
 have and s So I think that it's just that experiential edge that

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.360
 you get. Um, I love the students at Cal State Fullerton. I think

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.280
 there's just such a great group. There's such a great demographic group.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.200
 They're so hard working and they are just ready for challenges.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.110
 And they're so resourceful there, So resourceful. Um, I've talked

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.030
 with other friends who worked at different universities, even, you know,

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.950
 around the country. Um, and I have to say, like, I think that my

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.870
 student group my students are students at Cal State Fullerton are

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.790
 just some of the most awesome students, um, that I've ever had the privilege

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.700
 to work with on DSO. I do think that being a mum, being an

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.620
 alum is kind of a useful thing for me because I kind of know, like some

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.540
 of the ins and outs I mean It's definitely changed since I was there

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.460
 Is a a young student. Um, but, you know, some things were still

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.380
 the same, and I think that that gives me a little bit more like knowledge

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.300
 of, like, the infrastructure of Cal State Fullerton. Like, I'm

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.210
 a little more familiar with that than maybe somebody who wasn't a

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.130
 student there. So I think there are some advantages to being in a lump.
