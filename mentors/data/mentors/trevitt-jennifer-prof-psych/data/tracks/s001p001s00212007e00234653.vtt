00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.950
I think that probably most everything that I'm doing right now is different

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:13.060
 than what I thought I would be doing. I suppose it depends on

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:19.160
 what time of my life I'm thinking about. Um, certainly. All the way

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.260
 up until past grad school, I thought that I was going thio pursue a

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.360
 career in the pharmaceutical industry and be working, you know, in mostly

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.470
 in a lab. Either you know, running a lab or something like that.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.570
 Um, in terms of my career, as as a professor, um, I think that now,

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.670
 as opposed to like when I started being a professor, um, I think

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.770
 that one of the things that's different it may be kind of unexpected

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.880
 is how how much freedom I'm I have much more trust in my students.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.980
 That's that's, I think, a good way to say it. I when I started out,

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:14.080
 I was I think I was very hands on and very kind of micro managing and

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.180
 controlling when it came. Thio my students, particularly those students

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.290
 in my research lab. Um I think now that I've been doing this for

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:32.390
 longer, um, I am I have learned that they need to have a certain

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.490
 amount of freedom for their wonderful ideas to blossom, and so and and

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.590
 and kind of, just seeding that control is a part of that process.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.700
 Um eso kind of instead of saying, Here's what we're gonna dio saying

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.800
 we'll hear some parameters here. Here's what we could dio here some

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.900
 of the possibilities that I thought of. What do you think we should

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:09.000
 dio and and letting them come up with ideas? Andi, I think that that's

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.110
 been a change for me across the course of my of my career is a

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.210
 professor is kind of stepping back a little bit more and ceding control,

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:27.310
 um, to my students.
