I think that being a clinical psychologists probably does require a certain

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.400
 degree of emotional regulation because you have to kind of be

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.170
 able thio interface with clients and not show like surprise or disgust.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.940
 Um, but clinical psychology is really just one area of psychology.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.720
 And so, you know, like the feel that I'm in research psychology.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.490
 I mean, other than just general, you know, being in a social setting,

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.260
 levels of emotional regulation, it doesn't require anything more than

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.040
 that. So I think it really depends on what area of psychology you're

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.810
 talking about.
