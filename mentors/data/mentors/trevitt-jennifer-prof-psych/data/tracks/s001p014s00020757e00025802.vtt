00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.890
I think the best way to stand out is by bringing something to the table

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.940
 that is uniquely yours. So, for instance, um, you know, joining PDS

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.980
 a or joining psych, I I mean, that's great, but that's something a

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.030
 lot of students conduce. So I think the things that are really going

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:26.070
 to make you stand out are things like doing research with somebody

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.110
 or doing an internship. Um, where you are doing something that not

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.160
 every student is going to be doing and you are forming relationships

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.200
 that not every student is going to form. So I think that those were

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.250
 really the things that are going to make you personally in your application

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.290
 stand out from the rest.
