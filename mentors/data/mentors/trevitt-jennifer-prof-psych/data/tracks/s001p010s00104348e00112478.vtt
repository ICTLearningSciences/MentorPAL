00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.980
we have a lot of resource is on campus that students can use to help them

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.110
 kind of figure out what they want to do. My number one recommendation

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.240
 is the career center. They have tests that are available to you,

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.370
 kind of to figure out, like, what do you like to dio? What do you

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.500
 naturally good at all. So you know what? What's a What's a deal breaker

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.630
 for you? What? You know things that you absolutely don't want to

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.760
 dio, Um and they have a whole bunch of different tests that you can

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.890
 use to kind of narrow down your interests and then see what domains

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.020
 your interests and skill sets fit into. So that's a wonderful resource

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.150
 on campus, and I would highly recommend checking it out.
