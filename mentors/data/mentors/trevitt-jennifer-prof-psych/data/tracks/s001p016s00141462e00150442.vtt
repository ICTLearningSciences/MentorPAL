00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.830
the length of graduate school depends primarily on what kind of program

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.810
 you're in, so a master's degree usually takes 2 to 3 years, whereas

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:15.790
 a PhD can take anywhere from four thio six, maybe even seven years.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.770
 Um, in the PhD, What's really going to determine the length of the

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.750
 program is the type of research that you're engaged in. So if you are

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.730
 doing research where the studies, you know are accomplished really

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.710
 quickly, um, probably will not take you as long to finish your program.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.690
 Whereas if you're in a field where you know a single study could

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.670
 take months, uh, up to a year, then it's probably going to take you

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.650
 longer to finish your degree.
