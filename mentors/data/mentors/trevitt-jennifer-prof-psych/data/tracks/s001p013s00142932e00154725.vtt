00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.430
So for some of the research that I dio, I actually need people to have

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.020
 a certain skill set. But I don't expect my students to come into my

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.600
 lab with that skill set. Uh, if they have those skills, that's awesome.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.190
 That's a bonus for me. I don't have to go. I don't have to worry

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.770
 about teaching them how to do things. Um, but it is my expectation

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.350
 that students will not come to me with this skill set, and and that's

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.940
 part of what we do. What I do in my lab is training them. Um, so

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.520
 what I do expect from students is I expect them. Thio have an enthusiastic

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.110
 attitude. I expect them to be responsible and reliable. So when

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.690
 they say they're going to be there at a certain time, they better

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.280
 be there at a certain time. Because I often times have to train students

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.860
 in order for them to participate in my research. I dio expect

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.440
 a time commitment from them, so I generally will not take a student

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.030
 unless they can commit at least a year to my research, because I find

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.610
 that it takes me generally about three months or half a semester to

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.200
 train them in the skills that they need in order to be able to participate

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.780
 in the research.
