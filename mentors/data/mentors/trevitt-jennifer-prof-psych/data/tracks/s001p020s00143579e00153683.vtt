00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.210
writing an ape. A format is definitely a skill. So this is something that

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.570
 the way that you get better at it is you do it more so you practice

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.930
 more. Um, there are some wonderful websites out there that can help

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.290
 with AP style writing. One of my absolute favorites is the Purdue

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.650
 Owl. They have a lot of tips and tricks, some really great videos.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.010
 Another resource to you, though, is your professors. Most of us air

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.370
 trained to write in AP style, and we can help you and give you style

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.730
 tips. My one piece of advice is that if you want a professor to look

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.090
 over like a paper or something like that, give them as much time

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.450
 as possible. So don't send it to them the day before it's due because

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.810
 chances are they just will not have the time to look over your paper

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.170
 and to give you help at that point. But if you can get it to them

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.530
 a week before it's dio, you're much more likely to get some advice

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.890
 from them.
