00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.250
within the field of psychology itself. My mentors are, uh, Dr Margaret

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.650
 White, who I met when I was an undergrad and psychology. In fact, it

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.050
 was her bio psychology class. That really kind of set me on this path.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.450
 Um, and when I was in my Masters program, I worked as her graduate

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.850
 assistant. Um, and she is a great friend today, and we, you know,

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.250
 see each other regularly, and I'm still I still call her for advice.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.650
 Um, and then my graduate, my PhD mentor, was Dr John Salamone. Um,

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.050
 and he really taught me how to be an independent researcher. Um, taught

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.450
 me a lot about you know, how toe develop a research program and

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.850
 and kind of run a lab. And, um, he's someone that I also I'm still

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.250
 in contact with, and I call him for advice when I need Thio. And then

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.650
 Dr John Marshall, who I worked with as a postdoc, um, was really

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.050
 helpful to me in terms of just learning how to manage a lab and how

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.450
 to kind of be the head of a lab. And so, um, I learned a lot from him.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.850
 Um, and he's retired now. um, but I still I still him in contact

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.250
 with him occasionally and just kind of, you know, seeing how he's doing.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.650
 And it's actually been kind of interesting to me, too, because

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.050
 he's being retired. Um, you know, I'm kind of seeing from him like,

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.450
 Oh, what's life after? You know, what's it like once you retire? And

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.850
 what do you do where the where the old scientists go? Eso It's been

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.250
 really kind of fun following him on that journey.
