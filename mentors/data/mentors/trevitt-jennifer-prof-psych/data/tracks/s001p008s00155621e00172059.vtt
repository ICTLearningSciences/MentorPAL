I think the biggest risk I ever took was applying to my PhD programs.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.400
 That was really scary for me. Um, I was very afraid of not getting in

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.670
 anywhere. Um, I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to do it if I did

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.940
 get in. But I applied anyways, and I did get in to more than one

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.220
 program, and I ended up doing really well. And so that was really risky,

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.490
 though, Like that was I remember the when I put because at the

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.770
 time there was no riel internet. We had to fill out actual paper forms

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.040
 and put them through the US mail. And I remember dropping all of

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.310
 my applications. I just had this big batch. I think I applied to, like,

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.590
 10 schools. And so I had this huge batch of application packets

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.860
 going out to all these schools, and I put them into the mailbox at,

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.130
 like, the post office where you kind of have the little drawer that

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:09.410
 you pull and push him in there and then slammed the door off they go.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.680
 And I just remember my stomach dropping as soon as that door closed

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.960
 and they slid away, and I thought, Oh, man, what did I just dio? Yeah,
