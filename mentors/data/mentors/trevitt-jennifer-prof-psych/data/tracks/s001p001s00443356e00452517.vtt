00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.010
my specialty is bio psychology, which is sometimes also known as neuroscience.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:11.170
 It's the intersection between psychological phenomenon like

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.330
 thinking and feeling and sensing and moving or behaving is a better

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.490
 way to think of that. And then the actual biology. So like what is

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.650
 happening? And usually it's focused in the brain. So the central nervous

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.810
 system so so people in my field are looking at kind of like what

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.970
 is going on in the brain when X y Z is happening when you're feeling

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.130
 something, or when you're when you're hungry, or or when you've just

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.290
 learned something, what is changing or what's different in your

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.450
 brain.
