00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.360
Yeah. How long did it take me? Um, well, let's see. Let's do the math,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.860
 shall we? So I It took me five years to get my bachelor's degree, and

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.370
 then I was in a master's program for two years and then so that's

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.870
 seven years now. Then I was in my PhD program for for four years, so

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:28.380
 that brings us up to 11. I was at my post stock position for two years,

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.890
 so that's lucky. 13. So it took me, I guess, 13 years from when

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.390
 I started my bachelor's degree to when I got my current position at

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.900
 Cal State Fullerton.
