_BIO_LONG_,trevitt-jennifer-prof-psych,"My name is Dr Jennifer Trav It I'm an associate professor in the psychology department at California State University, Fullerton. I did my undergrad at Fullerton, so I'm actually an alum. I did my PhD at the University of Connecticut, so I lived in Connecticut for about four years, and then I came back to California and worked at U. C. I. And then I started teaching at Cal State Fullerton. I study the effects of nutrition on anxiety, depression and learning, and the courses that I teach our bio psychology, which has a lecture component and a lab component. I also teach psychopharmacology, which is the study of how drugs affect the brain. And I also teach intermediate research methods and statistics. And I love all of these classes. I have three Children and I'm married. My Children are 15 years old. I actually have triplets. They were born the year after I started teaching at Cal State Fullerton. So I've pretty much been a full time parent the whole time that I've been a full time professor and I really love my job."
