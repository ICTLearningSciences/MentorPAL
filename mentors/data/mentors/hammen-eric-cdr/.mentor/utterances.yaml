  transcript: My name is Eric Hammond. Um, currently a commander, Chaplain, station,
    Open up. Not working for a two star general, But my journey really began in 1992
    when I enlisted from a small town in Wisconsin and attended boot camp in San Diego.
    And from there I was Ah, radioman. My first duty stations included commands such
    as LST Fairfax County, which is no longer around. I went to the U. S s Kidd, which
    is also decommissioned. From there, I took a few different communication billets.
    One took me to Roosevelt roads. Puerto Rico is no longer a Navy base. Also, around
    2004 I felt a call into the ministry, and my enlisted career took me all way up
    to E six. And then I went over and commissioned as a chaplain candidate and finished
    my degrees and my graduate degree and became a chaplain. Tours is a chaplain.
    I started off going to Afghanistan with Second Marine Aircraft Wing, and immediately
    after that, I took a billet and deployed with ah seal team back to Afghanistan
    to very difficult and kinetic tours, where I learned a lot from there. I became
    an instructor for chaplains, and I was able to teach new chaplains and how to
    minister within the military. From there, it took me to, ah, ship USS San Antonio
    lpd 17 and finally brought me to the Pentagon, where I'm currently at now. My
    family has always followed me. I've been married for 25 years. I have four Children
    from the ages of 24 to 15 and everywhere I've gone has been a challenge. But it's
    been an opportunity for them to grow and learn more about the Navy and how we
    support.

  transcript: my name's commander, Eric Hamon, Um, chaplain serving a top nav staff
    up at the Pentagon. My journey really started in 1992 as an enlisted sailor, where
    I made it up to Petty Officer First Class and around 2004 I felt a call to the
    ministry, and after completing both of my degrees, I became a chaplain. There
    I served on different staffs, one with Second Marine Aircraft Wing, where I earned
    my warfare pin, and it served a very kinetic tour there in Afghanistan, followed
    by a second tour with Naval Special Warfare Group two. And when the seal teams
    were, we also had a lot of difficulty in country of Afghanistan. From there I
    became an instructor and ultimately on the USS San Antonio as a department head.
    Now I currently served on the staff under a two star. I do have a wife of 25 years
    and four Children.

    or as a former officer, and then to shape them and help them kind of around some
    of the rough edges what it's like to serve as an officer in the chaplain corps.
    The second major opportunity had in leadership was on L. A P. D. U S s San Antonio,
    where I was a department head of my chaplain department but also asked to lead
    and mentor a department executive, um, staff, where I had other swell officers
    under me. Various rates, administrative rates, PMS, y ends and such. Where I had

    to find out more about those individuals, that you want to see, what makes them
    tick and maybe some things that are stopping them from accomplishing the goals
    that they have. Because ultimately, as department, you're responsible for the
    divisions under you and all the personnel, and we want to have the same mission
    accomplished. We all want to meet the commander's intent and his priorities or
    her priorities. And so we are really the stopper and the gap in the filter from
    the higher ups and were pushing information down. But we're also taking information
    from the junior sailors and pushing it up to the chain of command

  transcript: some of the physical environments in which I worked at, um can be anywhere
    from an administrative office type environment. Thio. One of that would be a field
    environment with Second Marine Aircraft Wing, where your commands are spread out
    and you have to put boots on the ground and to visit your people and to take care
    of your commanders all the way to special forces, where you have a much more relaxed
    environment but still just as professional as any of the others. And to a ship
    where everybody is contained on one vessel and they can't go anywhere, so tracking
    them down is much easier.

    specific leadership style. Ah, good Leader also is someone who can look at its

    or Hogan Assessments, could be key in deciding where their individuals fit and
    also a good leader, I believe really gives opportunities for the people under
    them. Thio serve opportunities for the people under them to lead and take risks
    and chances. The leader's role is toe to take the responsibility off of them and
    give them opportunities to fail. And so I think that's where their development
    really shows. That's where they can really, uh, make the most money for the organization,
    which is the Navy. And that's gonna formulate their leadership style as they go

    I think the mistake is to go in full force and and try to take care of yourself.
    And in that case, I think many of the people that are you are supervising will
    consider yourself selfish. So I think that really as a leader, you need to observe
    those around you find who is doing what, find out who is the experts on certain
    things and get to know those. Hopefully you've done some research on where you're
    going, so you have a background. But I think that the first priority, really is
    that just sit back, observe and to see kind of the environment in which you're
    going into before you step into either direction of taking care of your own personal
    calls or diving completely into the individuals and ignoring your own career.

  transcript: the most difficult part of my training both and boot camp and as an
    officer at ODS and Chaplain School would be, I think, having to start from ground
    zero, um, taking away a little bit of my individuality, to understand that there's
    something greater out there besides myself and to connect me with the group at
    large, whether it be in boot camp or other officers and the officer schools or
    even in a chaplain corps. And I think that's, uh, kind of a painful process, but
    ultimately enduring and worthwhile, yeah.

  transcript: I think conflict is normal. Any place where you, um, put human beings
    in a situation, I think some of that can be mitigated by observing and doing the
    research before you get to that unit and also being someone who listens twice
    as much as they speak and get an opportunity to really try to connect with those
    personalities, um, involved. Before any changes are made or any okay, sweeping
    movements are done in order to change their leadership style.

  transcript: I think leading honorably is something that's more simple than people.
    Um tend to believe. I think if you're if you're true to your beliefs, if you're
    treating people with respect and with dignity, I think the honorable part is automatic.
    I think that if you're honest and letting your yes is be your yes, is, it keeps
    things simple. I think Mark Twain said, If you wanna, uh, not have to remember
    as much just tell the truth. And so I think that if we can just be consistent
    in our leadership, that will create an honorable leadership trade.

  transcript: I think there's Ah many different leadership styles and books. And just
    by a quick glance at the Barnes and Noble self help, I'll you can see that. But
    one that I have recently read, and that I think is really keen is Jim Mattis is
    book call sign Chaos, which breaks down different leadership styles and obviously,
    ah, very successful leadership style that he carried on through the Marine Corps
    and and then through civilian service.

  transcript: So when I was stationed at Naval Special Warfare, an opportunity to
    be, uh, chaplain for one of the specific teams, and so that entailed me doing
    work ups with them, deploying with them and then coming back and doing the return
    of the union with the teams and being embedded with them was key because it wasn't
    just the chaplain making a visit in Afghanistan for a couple of days. But it was
    the chaplain that was serving with them that was living with them that was training
    with them. And I think it really paid dividends and gave an opportunity for some
    real ministry to happen. And it was a blessing to see how they grew into the opportunity
    of having someone with them to provide those specific skill sets.

    the Marines love chaplains. The Marines love having you there. There is a role
    for you. There is a need for you. Like many other platforms or operations, the
    chaplain sometimes can be, um, second nature. But with the Marines, they're the
    first ones there. Where is my chaplain? And so having that knowledge that you're
    wanted and needed and provided it was never short of any work based on the age
    of the Marines having such young Marines in 18 to 24 year olds. So we were always
    busy, but it was a pleasure, and it was it was a great opportunity.

    you know, first, for instance, there's a being murder and and killing. Um, and
    so loving one's enemies is something that's second nature to us because, well,
    the god that I serve told us to love our enemies, that its's easy for us to love
    those like us. It's easy for us to love those who think like us and our look like
    us. But it's a challenge, and it is beneficial to love those who despise us. And
    I think it's a key role, and it helps us as leaders. And it helps us, uh, specifically
    as chaplains as we go about our day.

    to me it's an opportunity. It's an opportunity to learn others, because ultimately,
    when we're discussing truth and what we're discussing, what we believe is the
    way it's, it's an opportunity for us to really see the world through there. Their
    lens me, coming from a small town in the Midwest is gonna have a different observation
    of what life looks like than somebody from Southern California or from Bronx,
    New York. And so it goes the same way with somebody else's faith. And it just
    brings those opportunities and rich moments to really connect with humankind much
    like they would have, maybe in biblical times. For me, um, toe, look at people
    who speak different languages and their cultures, and it's just an increase is
    that understanding of God created people in all different shapes and sizes and
    beliefs and ethnicities, and Lord, that's it's a beautiful thing

  transcript: working with atheist is is no different than working, working with someone
    who is agnostic or even a believer. Um, everybody has their own understanding
    of the meaning of life, and so atheism is really a belief in what they think is
    the meaning of life. So it's no different than someone who says there's a Christian
    or a Muslim or a Jehovah's Witness. Um, it's all in the same category, all comes
    down to a belief, and I think treating people across the board with respect and
    honoring them doesn't mean you necessarily agree with them, but it gives them
    a voice to their thoughts.

    chat and then talk later when the individual is sober. But really the right time
    to talk to a chaplain is is the time of need. Um, I think if you push it off,
    sometimes circumstances enter into your life and you may forget or suppress that
    that feeling, but it really doesn't do you any good, But so the best time to talk
    to a chaplain is is when the need is there.

  transcript: chaplains air different. One key reason of the differences are confidentiality.
    If you speak to a doctor, which is important, or social worker or human resource
    is, or even those hired by fleet and family, um, you don't have that confidentiality.
    And so the commanding officer understands this and employs this. It's a federal
    mandate that when an individual comes and speaks to us, it's not my confidence.
    It's the person who's speaking me confidence, so I don't have the permission to
    share that. And I think that's important because it gives that one person that
    individual can really share literally anything in their life, whether it's a crime
    committed, whether it's a crime, that they're thinking about committed or something
    horrible in their life, that they don't want to get out. And so I think that's
    the one thing that a chaplain offers. Besides the spiritual aspect of the conversation
    that nobody else can have in the military

  transcript: a Sfar is becoming a chaplain. It it is, is competitive because I think
    in the military, in general, across the board, um, we're looking for the best
    and the brightest. And so, um, being a good minister or pastor or priest or imam
    out in the civilian world does not hold the same requirements, even physical standards
    that one must maintain to build to keep up with those 18 to 24 year olds. So a
    lot of people are disqualified just based on age or based on their physical standards.
    And then it comes down to the requirements as faras experience in education. So
    to become a chaplain, you have to have a bachelor's degree and a master's degree,
    plus at least two years of ministry experience. And that's not equal out in the
    civilian world. So I would say it's competitive to even just become a chaplain.
    And then while you're in the chaplaincy, if everybody is at that, high rate is
    just more competitive. Toe promote into advance

    that you're consistent, I think once you start saying things that you don't do,
    the trust gets lost very quickly. And I think that goes outside of your circle.
    If you say things, the others, um, that are not true or that may come back to
    be, yeah, un effective, you're going to see that it's going to get back to your
    people, and I think that trust is also gonna be eroded that way, too.

    if you have somebody who is inconsistent, that you don't know which person is
    going to be there to greet you that day, that is the most worst environment you
    could be in so consistency. Whether if you're a harsh leader or somebody who is
    a little bit more firm, the consistency matters and the same thing. If you're
    ah, more laid back or relaxed leader, I think it's something that they're going
    to expect when they come into a situation as they meet your intent, they're going
    to know how to approach you, and so I think that is probably the most important
    characteristic.

    repeat what you think that individual means. So you're on the same page and you're
    clear with their intent. But I think definitely listening more than speaking is
    the most important of the characteristics.

    Hard work should be done outwardly. If that individual has been uh to you and
    has notified that they get embarrassed by that type of reward, then maybe you
    can alter it and maybe do it on a smaller scale. But I definitely think it needs
    to be addressed, and it should be done immediately, not ah, year later or six
    months later. I think it should be done on the spot or shortly after.

    if I were in a situation where my direct supervisor was not giving me that feedback,

    leaders, especially senior leaders, are not short of opinions. And if you can
    play to that aspect in your life and just share and be transparent, say I really
    covet and appreciate any kind of guidance you can give me, I think you will get
    that either in a formal or informal fashion to help meet those needs.

    done or that a task was attempted, they're less likely in the future toe want
    to even conduct that task? So I think if if you get involved and not that you're
    in the weeds so much that you're in hindrance. But you're asking and enquiring
    about the product and and where it is on the the completion spectrum, I think
    that really goes to, ah culture of accountability.

  transcript: I think to identify strengths and weaknesses of team members really
    comes down to getting to know your people having conversations, and it may not
    be in a professional sense. Sometimes it's in a personal, um, engagement that
    you may have as a command together. Maybe you're you're all bowling together as
    a command to get to know each other, paintball or attending an academic or athletic
    engagement. I think you you get to know those individuals and you know their strengths
    and their weaknesses, and then when you're having opportunity to place them in
    those roles, their performance will be a great tell off what they're good at and
    what they're not, and to not be afraid to adjust those is going to be the key
    aspect of what a leader can actually do.

  transcript: I think managing military people as opposed civilians really comes down
    to accountability. Military members have a different set of accountability. They
    have the U C M J that they have to follow, and they have rules and regulation
    where civilians are a little bit loosely based on that, there are rules and regulations
    on how to discipline a civilian member. How to even fire or terminate a civilian
    member is different than one of a military individual. And so I think the accountability
    piece really plays a role in that supervision.

  transcript: I think one thing that makes my leadership style unique is my transparency.
    I've been told before and actually recently, that people have seen me as a more
    junior officer and now is a senior officer that I haven't changed, that I'm still
    the same person, that if something is wrong or or even if something is right that
    I'm focused on it, I I am able to share it and talk about the details. And I think
    it just makes for ah, more trust. And it shows, I guess my humbleness.

    One is I don't take myself too serious and I'm able to roll with the punches,
    understand that people are gonna be uncomfortable, maybe even around me, sometimes
    because of my position as a chaplain or a senior leader. Another characteristic
    that people might say is again my transparency, the way that I'm very quick to
    communicate things that I think is important, whether it's good or it's bad and
    also my ability to stay pretty consistent in my leadership style. A Sfar as I
    don't I don't waiver one way or the other. Uh, I don't get too high, uh, in emotions,
    and I don't also get too low. I'm pretty consistent and something that they can
    look Thio and expect from me.

    categories, and I believe you know, they're all really important. But there are
    some that are daily decisions on you know what, um, leave schedule. Are they going
    to take, or is there special liberty involved and other decisions that could be
    even a little bit more critical that have more ever lasting effects? Are, um which
    career path? Um, I'm gonna go down. Or if I apply to this officer program, how
    is that going to affect What are the 2nd and 3rd order effects of this? Is it
    gonna take me out of running for advancement in my rate or so forth? So there
    is there's important decisions with personnel, and then there's the personal decisions
    off. What would happen if if this marriage were to dissolve and were to separate,
    That would be a long last thing important decision that they would have to make
    that I could help walk them through. Or it could be his instances. What are me

  transcript: I think Officer school is much like a college or high school, or just
    any extended education is. Sometimes it's hard to see where the education picked
    up an experience took over. And so the practical things that you want to really
    focus on, I think when you're an officer school is maybe some of the anecdotal
    things that the instructors were talking about, the real life examples of how
    they applied the leadership styles that they're teaching in in officer school,
    and taking those opportunities to really internal internalized those situations
    and may be used for future decisions.

  transcript: So I think it's critical that you really examine yourself and not just
    once but continuously to understand how to be a good leader. You don't need to
    understand your shortcomings so you can fill the shortcomings with people on your
    team that are gonna, um, take the take the place of your mistakes. And you also
    need to understand that, uh, maybe there's people that are too close to you or
    to similar to you. That may be redundancy and a team, but just ultimately understanding
    where you are at the time on that team, what your role is, even as the leader
    and how that's gonna affect the other team members.

    just, uh, owning and taking responsibility. What I'm seeing a lot of is people
    pointing fingers and kind of walking away from an opportunity to really claim
    it and to fix it. And I believe that's important for subordinates to see you taking
    a responsibility as a leader, it shows ownership. It shows courage, and it gives
    them permission to trust you that if something does happen, that you will own
    up to it and that you will take that responsibility sometimes even when it's not
    your fault.

    who, uh, forget to look at the whole team, and they start to look at themselves
    individually and they make it off track. They may lose focus on where they would
    be, and and really, it's difficult to trust an individual who's out there just
    for themselves and not to say that self can't benefit from a successful team,
    because I think that's an accurate statement. But to really just look at yourself
    as the end and be all, I think that's very dangerous on the team.

    the lay of the land that they are able to give us to the greatest generation and
    some of these historical films that are coming out midway in 1917. And to really
    see these heroes on live screen, I think that's a reminder of why we're fighting
    and why were honorable, even if other countries don't necessarily ascribed to
    the same characteristics.

    they could come alongside and get on board with them.

    difficult, but it comes back to as a leader, knowing your people, understanding
    their weaknesses and sometimes your own transparency and your own opportunities
    to show where you have failed and have overcome that or have moved past. That
    will bridge the gap for you to really get alongside a team member who's failing
    and allowing them thio kind of hell from that and move on forward and knowing
    that most decisions in our life are not gonna end, um, there and that we have
    to move forward from it and they could turn out great things.

    life, and I don't mean just life and death but altering the course of their existence,
    so to speak, whether it's a relationship doing the right thing is never is never
    really wrong. But we have to understand that even if we break the rules for the
    right thing, that there may be consequences. But doing the right thing should
    outweigh those consequences.

    criticisms, maybe some of the the tips and the key items that you're giving, that's
    an individual that is worth throwing your information to those who are not willing
    to change, they're going to be in that situation. I think you still need to be
    fair and offer up that information, but just know and understand and not get your
    feelings hurt when they're not going to change and they're going to do their own
    thing.

    make a decision. Um, do I want to do? It's what I feel is right? Or do I have

    a chaplain who was at a Liberty port. And in order for you to go off the quarterdeck,
    you had to actually take a condom with you. Obviously, they were having problems
    on this ship with certain diseases and different issues. And so this chaplain,
    being a married man, thought that was a inappropriate for him to take a condom.
    But yet he understood the rules. So at this point, he took the condom and he went
    on liberty and he came back. But he made a point to take the condom and put it
    back in the bowl to prove to him the rest of the people that he still had integrity,
    that he still honor that he was still bound by the law. But it wasn't gonna affect
    his beliefs for his thought process.

  transcript: Yeah, there are. There are many problems that really need a specialist,
    touch to it or expertise. And I tend to look at things into three major categories.
    And those symptoms come in one way, shape or form in those categories. And that's
    the mind, the body and the spirit. And we see when people black sleep or they're
    not sleeping well or their diet is not correct or they're exercise. Um, those
    can really lead into a lot of different things where that person might be depressed,
    maybe going through some issues at home, maybe even considering, um, harming themselves.
    Also, we see that with with their mind, if if they're not actively engaged, if
    he starts seeing, um, symptoms of things where they just don't care about different
    things or they're disinterested, those also could be symptoms that psychiatrist
    or psychologist or a chaplain could kind of walk through. And and even from my
    perspective, spiritually, a lot of people who are struggling with that, um, could
    be a real symptom of something greater in her life of, of meaning, of Why are
    they here? What's the use of it all anyway? So those types of symptoms that you
    will see within the mind. The body and spirit are really opportunities for you
    to ask that person to go see professional help for them to go talk to the chaplain
    and allow the chaplain to kind of refer them out to either a psychologist or family
    life services or or just any place that they might seem would be a benefit that
    can really get them in the right frame of mind.

  transcript: people leave the Navy for multiple reasons. Hopefully, they're leaving
    it because they felt like they accomplish the goals that they said a task. What
    we don't want is people to leave dissatisfied and unfulfilled. And so sometimes
    I think people leave the Navy because they really didn't know, um, what they're
    getting into. They had a maybe a unrealistic expectation of what it was going
    to be like, maybe a location or station that they were going to be at. Maybe the
    how sexy the job that they were going to go to was going to be because it was
    differently in the movie that they saw. So I think that they have a sense of un
    fulfillment, and maybe that's due to also a lack of leadership. Maybe they got
    under a bad chain of command which discourage them and didn't challenge them or
    didn't feel that they were necessary. And so I think there's a variety of reasons,
    but really I think it comes down to what they thought they were getting into,
    and it didn't meet up the expectations

  transcript: you know, one way toe, I think toe work smarter is toe toe Look at history.
    And to look at what's been done before you, you re creating something that's already
    been effective. Are you or are you doing something that really hasn't worked?
    And you're just turning your wheels. So I think as you observe as you study the
    history of whatever circumstance you're in, that's an opportunity to find out
    what's actually gonna work, what's not gonna work and how to approach the task.

    understand it is greater than us. And I think generations in the past really caught

  transcript: I think one way, uh, that you can develop skills within a team is to
    observe the other teammates within that team. The find out where their strengths
    and deficiencies are. And how do you assimilate your own personality? How do you
    assimilate your own strength and weaknesses and how that's going to contribute?
    Um, to the team ahead. Sometimes that's gonna be require some additional training.
    Additional guideline. Whether that's formal training, informal on the job. The
    ultimate goal is that when we look around the team that we have people that are
    complementary to one another and they're able to get the mission done.

    would not respond for some reason whether they were unable to because of location.
    And so my agreement was I think that it was appropriate for them to respond because
    they were going to deal with the backlash. They were going to deal with the how

    they would never have seen me again. And so there was a disagreement on who is

    see even see that in Scripture, as in King David with failure. So I mean, people
    have to be judged not based on the one failure, but really the the totality of
    their circumstances and the efforts that they've put forth. So I think if everybody's
    honest and they can look inwardly, they know that they have failed at some point.
    So when someone alongside them fails, there should be more empathetic and understanding
    and ready to help that individual get back to success.

  transcript: I think everybody has self doubt. I think it's it's natural. We're human,
    we're finite beings. And so sometimes I just have to be reminded. And for me,
    I go to Scripture and it reminds me that I've been fearfully and wonderfully made
    that God knew me while I was still in the womb and knew the number of hairs on
    my head. And so for me, I really take it back to that Spirituals promises that
    God has already given me.

    are deadlines that are on. Maybe on a Monday that I have to do some work on the
    weekend. I will do it infrequently, but it's not something I just choose to do.

  transcript: you know, being a leader does give you some opportunity for a flexible
    work schedule, but it also gives you a burden of responsibility to want to be
    there for your individuals and the people that work for you. So I believe good
    leaders will alter their work schedules in a more robust way. Where there, there
    someplace, maybe a little bit earlier, or some place a little bit later than the
    rest of their subordinates to model that leadership. And it's not an abusive situation
    where because their leaders, they take more time off.

    some level, my Children. I look at to see what is would be a good fit, whether
    it's to stay to homestead and stay in the local area because of the familiarity
    or an opportunity for your career. Is it gonna balance, um, your career out where
    it's going to give you an opportunity to promote and at the same time be a good
    place for your family? So the strategy I use is I look at what we call an Alfa
    roster, which shows where everybody is at. Look at the window in which I am to
    deploy and maybe right down 5 to 10 different jobs that would be interesting and
    be beneficial for my family. And then I take time to really pray about it and
    to maybe do a little research about it. And so when I'm talking to my detailer
    or the monitor, whichever decides your fate, I have an accurate assessment of
    where I would like to go. What would be beneficial for both my career and for
    my family?

    your giving them the resource is that they need Thio prepare for their family.
    The legal resource is the wills, the general power of attorneys making sure that
    they have, um, something to communicate with their family. So they understand
    the parameters of where they're going to be at the limitations that they're gonna
    have, and just things that are going to connect them back to it. And then the
    last thing I would probably make sure I have is some stuff that I can use to train.
    Whether it's something as simple as bringing some leadership books, things that
    we can read together and to grow together, and some resource is along those lines,
    I think those are all really key things to look at, especially as a leader

    the definition of emergency is. You're not expecting it, but one instances, I

    weeks into my deployment, hurricane came down the East Coast, where they had to
    evacuate everybody in that location. So the plan we had in place was having some
    readily funds available, some cash, um, that my wife could take in case the banks
    and the A T. M's were down. And we were able to use that cash to get a hotel room,
    and she was able to go far enough away with the plans that we've already established,
    um, to take care of that emergency. So really having a contingency plan, having
    some resource is available in case even a natural disaster happens. And I think

    A za leader. It's a little bit more difficult because you want to make sure that
    your people are are taking the leave that they have, and sometimes they want to
    build up, but to encourage them toe to take some time off in between those long
    periods of work. But as far as a leader, I get a chance to take a vacation just
    like anybody else. It just have to be a little bit more conscious of who is going
    to be around and maybe the person, my deputy or somebody right under me, um, is
    going to be there while I'm gone in case there's any issues. But that opportunity
    to really sever your time from work and to really focus on your family is is key,
    and it actually pays dividends for the rest of the command.

  transcript: I think one of the big secrets in the military of being content and
    being happy is realistic expectations. I know it sounds very boring, but if we
    go into a situation understanding, um, the intent of what it is, I think it gives
    us a frame of mind and allows us to really not to have ah pie in the sky type
    of dream, but to have a realistic expectation. And then when things go better
    than normal, you could be pleasantly surprised. But understand that you're you're
    serving your country, that there's a reason why we all raise our hand and and
    signed up to do this voluntarily. And so I think the satisfaction of that needs
    to be where we start and set our bar and to understand anything above that, all
    the benefits that come with the military, whether it's pay, whether it's, ah,
    the G I, Bill or V a loan are all really just that they're just benefits of something
    that we really were going to do anyways.

    abuse it and buy something with it. I e. A car or motorcycle or something that
    would be considered perishable and not maintaining its value. Where I've seen
    people really succeed is by taking their bonus and investing in it and putting
    it into something much more reliable, maybe adding it to their their TSP. And
    I know it's it's not sexy and it doesn't satisfy their needs right down in there.
    But in 20 years, when they retire, they're gonna they're gonna be really glad
    they did that.

  transcript: I think, um, any individual who joins the military should really, um,
    could start considering retirement because we know that compound interest works
    mysterious way in the earlier you start, the better off you're gonna be. And even
    if you do not decide to make the military career with the new TSP system, they're
    matching funds, and you're able to take that money with you at your next career.
    And if you have a federal career, you could just continue in the TSP, um, system.
    And if not, you could take that money and it's still gonna grow. So I think early
    is better. Um, I think if you spend everything right away thinking that you're
    just gonna you're gonna be fine in the future. That's when you see people struggling
    as they get ready to retire.

    want to give their sailor or Marine an opportunity to spend time with their family,
    but also understand that there are sometimes limitations where you are in a location
    where you can't necessarily make it back. And so having those, um, those conditions
    with your family back home to make sure that they're taking care of is also an
    important feature.

  transcript: you know, it is very common for an individual to start down one path
    and maybe fail or voluntarily step out of it. And so it depends on on the career
    that they're looking into it. If you're trying to get into buds, for instance,
    many times they ask for an alternate rate that you may want to go into in case,
    um, that does not work for you. But I found that even in my own career, starting
    off of the radium in which converted to an I. T. I, I transferred over to legal
    men when my interest changed, and now I'm a chaplain. So I think there's many
    different pathways. One end of one pathway does not mean failure. It just means
    that opportunity for a new pathway.

    You know, 4 to 6, you get one year as a G 4 to 6 years as lieutenant. That's about
    a 70% advancement rate to lieutenant commander, another four or five years as
    lieutenant commander and another 40 to 50% is a commander and then another 3 to
    5 years as a commander, Thio captain. And so the potential is there, Um, it depends
    on the individual and the opportunities that they have taken while they were in.
    But it's it's something that is it's a fair process. I have seen it myself, a

    So there are some provisions for the people who are even over 60 to get waivers

    qualify for at the command basis, apply for it. If it's something outside the
    command, something that comes out Navy messaging sometimes sends out things. For
    instance, there's a message looking for, um, interns working for the justice system
    up in D. C. If that seems to something that you would fit, you can apply for those
    types of things talking your chain of command, getting that sometimes you look
    for foreign service officers, maybe you speak a different language, and that's
    something that you'd be interested in. So you would again just go through the
    channels that air within the Navy message and apply for those opportunities

  transcript: So I've been blessed to have at least somebody at every command that
    I can tow, lean into whether it was N. C. One on a ship or whether it's just my
    direct supervisor as a chaplain. But I try to surround myself with people who
    I respect. Maybe they are not like me. Maybe they're different denomination or
    ethnicity, or they have different beliefs or thoughts. But I respect them for
    their accomplishments and the things they do. So it really depends on where I'm
    stationed, because along the lines of somebody who wants to support you, there
    are always people who are going to doubt you and say that you can't do it or giving
    excuse why. So you have to have discernment and who you're talking thio and understand.
    Those are the people that you want to follow.

  transcript: So one question that I think is important for us to realize is when
    we're talking about mentorship in a relationship, it's not just the mentor teaching
    the mentee. I think there's a lot that the mentee can really teach that mentor.
    It's both ways. Not only that is, I think even if you think that you're at the
    bottom level and you're the one being mentored, there's always somebody below
    you that needs the same type of mentorship. So as you are seeking out a mentor,
    you should be seeking out someone that you can mentor yourself, and I think that
    will be very holistic for you. It gives yourself a 3 60 view of your own personality
    and would be beneficial both ways.

    to go to college earlier than later. Um, there's nothing wrong with going to college
    later. And in fact, sometimes your experience and the things you have gone through
    makes you appreciate it more. But I think going to college earlier sometimes limits
    maybe the other things, that responsibility that you may have later in life. For
    instance, I went to college and I had Children. I went to college. I had two Children
    at the time, and I went to graduate school. Had four Children at the time, so

    qualify for those things. But however, I do qualify to use my G i bill if I needed
    Thio. And there's also programs within the chaplain corps that sends, oh, Force

    uh, cooks used to be called mess specialist, but when they went to get a job out
    in town as a cook or a culinary person, they don't understand what a mess specialist
    was now their culinary specialist. So getting a job coming from a culinary specialist
    Avenue is easily aligned to the civilian world, and so they've done great pains
    to do that, also to upping their qualification. So, for instance, ah, legal men
    now will leave the Navy with the peril legal qualifications that will transfer
    right into the civilian world so continuously working on those opportunities.

    ones showing interest in you. Without you even knowing it. They're giving you
    guidance. They're giving you support. Uh, they might see something in you that
    sparked an interest in them, but it's natural for them. You know that. It's going
    to be something, uh, longstanding. I think if you are the one that has to constantly
    contact your mentor, it's probably not gonna last very long.

    easily you can find someone senior to you. They may have shown an interest in
    you, at least personally. So that would be where I would start closest to me as

    if it was voluntary or involuntary. Those who usually separate separate on a voluntary
    basis have some sort of preparation, have a plan, have something in line that
    they were looking to for a very long time, and so that separation is much easier
    now. They may come to a point where they realize that, um, they're not part of
    the same club they have been for a very long time. So there is a transition for
    that. Those who were separated involuntarily have a little bit bigger struggle.
    Maybe they didn't do the same leg work that the other individual did. So they
    have. Hopefully. Still, some of the same resource is that they can talk thio even
    talking to a chapel and to help prepare for that, um, to get to different options
    that they may have. But it really depends on where they're coming from. And what

  transcript: I think having the right training degree or experiences is very important.
    While you're in the military, it's gonna it's gonna really characterize your service
    and to what jobs you are qualified for. But more importantly, you know, most of
    our life has done outside the military. Eventually, one day we do get out and
    Soto have, ah, competitive degree or experience that will translate out in the
    civilian world. I think is very crucial. And sometimes those degrees don't match
    up. For instance, maybe you are wanna be a business person, but in the Navy, you're
    a swot or you're an aviator. So having a degree, an MBA and business might be
    something that will put you at the next level out in the civilian world. So I
    think it just depends on your goals and your situation.

    too common. Um, not that it happened less in the past, but now, because of social
    media and because of people recording everything, it's it's much more out there.
    But some of the things that could be on the lookout or for things that may seem
    in some societies, okay, But they're really not touching someone's bottom, saying
    Good game or maybe even giving somebody a shoulder rub or being aggressive and
    asking somebody out more than one occasion, even if they originally said no. I
    think those sometimes in some societies, like it's OK, but it really is effective
    effects the individual that it's happening Thio and then undermines everybody
    else in the command.

    see that's beyond sexual harassment. It could be from just someone's lifestyle.
    Maybe they do not participate in the same things that the rest of the crew do,
    or the rest of division does, and they might be singled out. Maybe it's It's just
    something like in high school where this person doesn't like sports and they have
    other interests over here. They could be harassed for that. Sometimes if they
    don't want to partake in alcohol or those types of activities that could be harassed.
    And so the harassment really Onley goes to the imagination of the individual.
    But sexual harassment is one of them, but not the only.

  transcript: so different types of assault. There are different reporting factor
    is a restricted and unrestricted. Both have, um, different circumstances. So restricted,
    uh, report is one report that you would submit that nobody knows Thea events that
    took place. I'm not sure if it's just the commanding officer, you may be aware,
    but what it does do is it allows all of the evidence to be collected all the different
    specimens unfortunate nous happened, but to not be reported upon a chain of command,
    The unrestricted is you report it, they collect all the evidence and it goes up
    the chain of command not necessarily your immediate chain of command, but for
    the people who can address the sexual assault Now, if you report to a chaplain,
    it doesn't matter if it's restricted or unrestricted, because they have confidence
    and they will not report it for either way. So it's a safe haven there. I will
    say that if you report to certain individuals like if you report to ah hospital
    out in town, you no longer can have a restricted because they're bound by different
    laws than in the military. So there is a little bit of nuance and complications,
    but in essence is who sees the reports knowing that you go and get help. Either
    way is what's important.

    from there you take it up chain of command, that they do not report it. If they
    do not address it, then you take it up the chain of command. Now, if it's the
    victim, it is there right to report or UN report whether they want to do a formal
    investigation there, that's up to them. But I think you need to immediately. If
    it's gonna hurt outside of people, I would again, another great resource to go

    is individuals asking, What if I have Dunmore? What if I was stepped in or saw
    the signs? So you may have to deal with some secondary and third order effects
    of your sailors as they cope with this. And then you have to deal with individuals
    who may be joke about the suicide or, um, say that the place is better off without
    him. They didn't want him there anyways, so you have to deal with those types
    of reactions which are valid reactions and and very normal. But to understand

  transcript: so having thoughts of suicide is very common. It's its's ridiculous
    almost to tell somebody to stop thinking about suicide. Um, but some of the ways
    that you can do is is to make sure that you're talking to individual. And so,
    um, if you were taking a trip to Australia and didn't have ah passport or a plane
    ticket, I would probably think that you're not serious. And just like, if you're
    talking about suicide and you really don't know, um, you need to listen to that
    person and think. But if they have a plan in place and they have a place, that
    they're gonna do this, it's a very serious thing that you need to address, but
    really just taking everything seriously, taking everything as it's important to
    that individual not downplaying any of their experiences or any any of their loss
    that they had that's making them feel this way. Making sure that they have the
    resource is that they need that they have an individual that they can contact
    at any point of the day, whether that's yourself, whether that's a family member
    or a friend, whether that's a chaplain or ah, social worker. But having numbers
    that they can contact whenever they're on their lowest point, contemplating suicide
    is going to be key

    Um, in the past, they would. There was contracts that were being made between
    the individual who was contemplating suicide and the person that was necessary
    counseling with him. But really, what it comes down to is is having more than
    one resource for them. Um, there is always a national suicide hotline, and depending
    on the location you're at or a regional area, that could be 1 24 hour number that
    they could call. Um, the chain of command should be one, and I would always recommend
    a friend or somebody close to them. A family member should be on that list, but
    making sure that's just not one number that they have or one resource. And to
    have two or three, maybe if it's if it's on a corridor. If I were counseling that
    individual toe, maybe I take their phone and ask them for their phone and and
    place my number in there specifically, eso. I know that they have that resource,
    and then if they can't get a hold of me to give them an alternate place, I think
    that's key because many times. It's just the person to talk Thio an individual
    to connect with that's gonna help them cope with that.

  transcript: So in the Navy and even in the civilian world, there's a list of kind
    of suicidal risks that you would see someone particular participate in. That may
    be a trigger or something to observe, but the common denominator for all suicide
    or death by suicides is loss, and that could be loss of a relationship. Could
    be loss of status. Money rank could be lost of ah, pet could be loss of freedom.
    Um, but really looking at those things and taking it serious when you start seeing
    those symptoms, whether they're giving things away, whether they're different
    than they were before, Just because somebody is happy or acting happy doesn't
    mean they're not suicidal. In fact, sometimes people act happy when they have
    a plan to end their life because they feel like it's almost over. So there is
    some very common misconceptions about that. But looking for lost an individual's
    life is a trigger that I would do as a professional Azam counseling somebody and
    talking to them and then being forthright and asking them saying something along
    the lines of Hey, you know, people who have this circumstance that happened to
    him. Whatever it is, sometimes they think about killing themselves, that something
    you've thought about and bringing it to the point and you may get a response of
    No, that's not anything that I'm thinking about or you're crazy or, you know,
    thank you for asking. I have had thoughts which will then open up a dialogue,
    that we can have a real conversation.

    I would never go outside of anyone's circle unless they gave permission, but to
    really encourage them because that individual is going to be with them for for
    a little long haul. I maybe only station there for a year, a year and a half or
    three years at the most. But that individual that they choose, whether it's a

    then and there. But sometimes operations, whether you're deployed and there's
    maybe a mission the next day and it's not quite feasible. So, um, it's real difficult,
    but to try to find in the individual time for that person to have access to resource
    is one of the things that we did as chaplains is we were able to embed with the
    teams and all of a sudden, now you have an instant councilor. There s so many
    times they would go out on ops and deal with some traumatic issues, sometimes
    loss. And I was there when they came back and I was there. It was somebody familiar
    that they could talk Thio. It didn't fix the situation, But then to make sure
    that once we return that we could spend some real time as as a unit, And the danger
    is that when you return from combat, everybody separates and and goes their own
    way. But it's really key and important that individuals get that time to decompress
    together and to share stories and to share experiences to make sure that they're
    kind of resetting before they take off and go to the next mission.

  transcript: So when, when dealing with individuals who might be what we would call
    out of the fight because of sickness and and if you're a leader or coworker there,
    there are many different options. I mean, everybody in their life goes through
    some scenarios where they may not be an optimal health or maybe in a tough situation,
    even if it's not them. And so to understand that and Thio maybe educate those
    around you and so to take care of the individual, making sure that they're getting
    what's needed. Because the reality is if we rush people back too soon and they're
    not ready to come back, they're just gonna they're gonna get back out of the fight.
    But if we could get up and round and and ready to go and and purely taking care
    of everything that they need to, they're gonna be another asset to the team. And
    then when they come back, maybe there's opportunities to give all those individuals
    who had to step up and maybe take some extra workload. Maybe they get a little
    bit of time off and an opportunity to kind of regroup themselves

  transcript: so many times in the military, you get put in places that you weren't
    trained for, and that's a very difficult one. That comes to mind. Was my first
    tour to Afghanistan. There was a group of Marines who were the reservists from
    the middle of America. They were assigned as generated mechanics and different
    jobs and and they got placed in a unit that was was responsible for collecting.
    Uh, they're dead comrades their body parts and then do inventories and place them
    on a plane back to Dover to their family members. Ah, very difficult thing that
    they were not expecting to do. They did not have the training for but to understand
    that they were part of something much bigger, something that was going to be,
    uh, fruitful for the whole unit, fruitful for the families. And ultimately, when
    they left, uh, such a memory of of service that they got to accomplish while they
    were in country
