,,hammen-eric-cdr,What year were you born?,I was born in 1974.
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How old are you now?,I am 45 years old.
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Where did you grow up?,"I grew up in a small town of Little Chute, Wisconsin, in the Fox Valley."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Tell me about your childhood.,"my child was fairly normal. I had to immigrant parents. One who was from France and my father's family was from Holland. He and, uh, whose middle class He was a police officer my entire life where my mother was a translator in a welding company, Miller Electric. I have two older brothers, 10 years in about eight years, and they were pretty much out of the house by the time I was in my formative years. And so it was a pretty normal situation in a small town where I knew everybody and went to school with the same people from kindergarten to high school, which is actually one of the reasons which drew me to want to leave and explore and try something else in the military."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Tell me about your family growing up.,"my family was unlike, uh, other families in the area. We had a mom and a dad who loved me very much and are still together, and it's still alive. They're both from different countries. So the only thing different that I had was maybe the food on her table. My brothers were typical older brothers. Nice to me when it benefited them, but mostly I was there bully or the one that they could take advantage of. They were a little bit older than I was. Um, eso I spent most of my time as an only child because they were either in college or out of the house. I had friends that I grew up with, um, pretty much my entire life, the same group of friends, but as far as my family, a lot of families from my father's side, um, there many cousins that I got Thio to play with and hang out with and go to different family events"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"When you were a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up?","when I was a kid, the the thing that I remember mostly wanted to be was something that I think many, many kids may want to. But I wanted to be a game show host. Believe it or not, I wanted to be on TV. I wanted Thio make people laugh, and I could see that growing up in in the late seventies, early eighties, those were very popular. And so that is what I wanted to be when I grew up."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What kind of student were you?,"I was not a very good student. Extracurricular and social activities were way more important. I did realize that if I applied myself, I could get good grades. And once I got those good grades, I knew I could do it and probably never did it again until I got to college."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What was your home life like?,"my home life was was pretty normal. I was growing up in the late seventies, early eighties. I was a latchkey kid where my parents both worked and came home after in the evening where we did eat meals together when I was not doing different activities. Um, after school sports, different extracurriculars, but it was pretty normal. My parents are still intact and still are together to this day, and I actually still both alive."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,When did you start working with the Navy?,"I started working with the Navy in 1992 when I left my small town in Little Chute, Wisconsin. I wanted to get away and experience something different, and so that was my opportunity, and that's when I started working with the Navy."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What is your current position now?,I currently serve as the deputy operations that op knobs on the chief of Navy Chaplains Office.
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What does a Chaplain do?,"a chaplain has four core capabilities, and that basically tells us what we do is we provide for people of our faith. We facilitate for others with different beliefs or no belief at all. We advise our commanding officers on different avenues with religion and morality and ethics, and also we care for all."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What were your major leadership roles?,"my major leadership roles ultimately came down to is when I became ah, chaplain, and the first one I can think of is as as an instructor at the Chaplain School, I was the person that people would look thio in leadership roles. And that was precisely. My job is to mold and shape junior officers many times civilians with no military experience, or even people who had military experience both enlisted or as a former officer, and then to shape them and help them kind of around some of the rough edges what it's like to serve as an officer in the chaplain corps. The second major opportunity had in leadership was on L. A P. D. U S s San Antonio, where I was a department head of my chaplain department but also asked to lead and mentor a department executive, um, staff, where I had other swell officers under me. Various rates, administrative rates, PMS, y ends and such. Where I had a different role, um, or traditional leadership style where I got to help shape the evil and fit rep process within that avenue"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How do you spend most of your time at work?,"currently in my role right now in a leadership position as a commander at the Pentagon, which is very rank heavy. I still have those opportunities to both a lead by example and be a mentor and coach on the side and help share my experiences of what brought me to my position from the illicit ranks now to the senior officer ranks so that it's more of a one on one situation, an opportunity that I get to pour myself into their lives."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Describe the work you did on a typical day.,"the work I do on a typical day currently now is one of administrative. We have an opportunity in the chaplain corps to shape strategic thinking and how we are going to do ministry in the future, maybe 10 years, 15 years down the road. So it's my privilege to get that chance to write training, to meet those requirements again, opportunity to share that to the fleet and present those opportunities and pushing leadership down to them so they have that chance and opportunity to lead from their echelon and their point of contact."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Describe the work you did on a typical day as a department head.,"so as the department had your your day never really ends and you wake up and you're making sure that your people are taken care of, that they have all the material that they need to accomplish the task that you may have given them. But I think it goes beyond that. I think it goes on to the fact where you want to find out more about those individuals, that you want to see, what makes them tick and maybe some things that are stopping them from accomplishing the goals that they have. Because ultimately, as department, you're responsible for the divisions under you and all the personnel, and we want to have the same mission accomplished. We all want to meet the commander's intent and his priorities or her priorities. And so we are really the stopper and the gap in the filter from the higher ups and were pushing information down. But we're also taking information from the junior sailors and pushing it up to the chain of command"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Describe the physical environments in which you've worked.,"some of the physical environments in which I worked at, um can be anywhere from an administrative office type environment. Thio. One of that would be a field environment with Second Marine Aircraft Wing, where your commands are spread out and you have to put boots on the ground and to visit your people and to take care of your commanders all the way to special forces, where you have a much more relaxed environment but still just as professional as any of the others. And to a ship where everybody is contained on one vessel and they can't go anywhere, so tracking them down is much easier."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How many hours do you work in a typical week?,"The beautiful thing about the Navy is we get, we get, we don't get paid way, don't get paid by the hour. We get paid a salary, which means that we're always on the clock. Things are always happening. Life happens. Um, and so we work. Depends if you're underway. You have seven day work days with maybe an opportunity for, ah break on Sunday, or maybe a separate day when missions are not happening. Um, to when you're back from deployment, when you have an opportunity to thio, recharge your batteries and to spend time with family and to get an opportunity to, um, maybe have half days where you can take care of things that need to be done either personally or professionally."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How much does the hours you work in a typical week change as you take on a leadership role?,"as a leader. The hours do change because now you have an added responsibility. So you have no responsibility to, in my opinion, be the first one there and and the last one to leave. There's rare occasions where you wanna push some leadership down to train the next level of petty officers or junior officers to meet that level, where you give them more responsibility on time management. But really, it comes down to your always on. You're always on watch. You're always on duty because your your business is to take care of people the most important weapon system the Navy has."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What kinds of decisions do you make in your career on a daily basis?,"as leader. You make all sorts of decisions from approving someone's leave or special liberty, which could be done very quickly. And at a quick glance to something where you're you're dealing with an individual's career, whether it's positive they're applying for a specific program or a transfer or even negative decisions that are gonna affect someone's livelihood. Um, even coming down to something that's gonna happen, possibly to their family."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What kinds of problems do you deal with?,"well as a chaplain and as a leader. We deal with all different sorts of problems. We get personal problems where individuals come because they're having ah, situation at home that you're dealing with maybe with a loved one or ah, child to professional problems that they're trying to possibly trying t gain the next rank or for promotion and trying to figure out the formula on what the best way to do that. Sometimes there's interpersonal relationship problems within the command that they're dealing with. The personality, that is, that is another peer that they're they're serving with might be one that they're struggling with and the conflict Israel and it's affecting your work. So it really comes down to the gamut of the individual individuals are serving underneath you."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What is a story that really shows what it is like working in your job?,"you know, a typical story or thing that would happen in my job as a leader. I remember helping ah, young sailor who was having some issues with his specific leader in his division. Um, I got an opportunity to walk through some leadership aspects of what it takes, um, to serve under many different personalities. But get an opportunity to, uh, correctly go through his chain of command, walk him through that, um, together and almost be a mitigator between those two individuals where it ended up working out that it was miscommunication. When both people were on the same page. They got along great and no careers were hurt or suffered, and things got were able to be accomplished and got done."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What are the major benefits of doing this kind of work?,"the major benefits of doing work is a job on his first. To me, it's not a job is something I love to dio. I get to deal with the Navy's most precious weapons system, which deals with people without people operating that the ships and the aircraft and taking care of, um, those hard pieces of gear without people. Without them being resilience and be able to accomplish those tasks, the Navy would be nothing. So the joy I get the most out of is really coming alongside people caring for them, loving on them, making sure that they're taking care of and helping them solve the problems."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What are the major negatives of doing this kind of work?,"One of the major negatives of Chaplin and as a leader is the fact that we're in a in a place where we're full of humans. So there's error everywhere. There's, there's sadness, there's disappointment. There is opportunities to enter into people's lives where you see the struggles that they have to go through the different circumstances that they have to overcome and and sometimes it could be very negative, and it could be harmful to both them, to their shipmates, to their family, and that's probably the most difficult part."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How much travel do you do in a year?,"amount of travel. I do really depend on the job I I held currently right now working at the Pentagon. I get an opportunity to travel to different training sites, maybe three or four times a year to do the training. But previously on a ship. Obviously the travel is is done by deployment where you get the opportunity to visit other countries. And also, when I was with naval special warfare that travels a little bit more robust because I had to go to different sites where they were training, and then as a deployed to bounce around those operating areas."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Why do you love your job?,"one thing I really love about my job is taking care of people, um, finding someone coming to me for, ah question or, ah, problem or a situation that they're in and be able to sit down with them and walk them through and and a lot of times allowing them thio figure out their own answer and watching the light bulb go on and them taking that advice or that guidance that sometimes they've given them themselves and watching them succeed or conquer the thing that they came in the first place to talk to me about."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What gets romanticized about your career field that really isn't that great?,"I think one thing that gets romanticized about my career field as a chaplain is that, well, one thing is that all we do is work on Sunday way. Just we get up in front of people. We walk around the spaces and and pass out candy and and where the nice guy everywhere we go. But in reality, um, it's much more than that because we're meeting people where they are. We're doing life with our our congregants, so to speak. So when bad things happen, we're in the midst of it. When good things happens, we get to share. But most most of the time, just as in human kind and has a Z, People go, we go also."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What are some of the common misconceptions about your field?,"some of the common misconceptions about our field is one is that all chaplains are the same that we all do believe the same thing but actuality. We all come from our own faith backgrounds and were given permission to act as such and act within our faith backgrounds. Another misconception is that all we do is walk around and and talk to people and a bearer of good news when the truth of the matter is that were many times in places of of despair and places, of hurt and confusion. And we are brought into that a real level because we're stationed with them and sometimes deployed with them doing life with them, and it could take a real toll on individual both them as they're presenting the information. But to us is as chaplains who are carrying it all with us."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What do you do now that is different from what you thought you would be doing?,"um, one thing that I do now that I thought I was gonna be doing was a lot of what I call it ministry. Ah, lot of administrative work. Um, staff work where I have, um, to produce documents that go up and down the chain of command. And that's something that I really didn't see myself doing. A za junior officer. Now, mawr that I'm that I'm a senior officer. I have to do much more administrative work."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How did your work day change over your career?,"my work day changed throughout my career is a Zai was Junior. I had more opportunity Thio leave earlier because my my seniors will allow me to go if I completed my tasks. But as I got up the ranks, I became the person that was responsible for everybody else and responsible for making sure that the work was done. So the roles reverse we're now I want to let my juniors, um, go early, allow them toe to spend time with their family and taking care of personal, um, issues and where I take more of the brunt of the work days, spending more time coming a little bit earlier and stuff like that."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"Where did you have to move in your career, and how did that change things each time?","throughout my extended career of 28 years, I had to relocate many times. It seems I started off on the East Coast. Um, immediately, I went overseas to Roosevelt Roads. Puerto Rico brought my wife with me there. From there, I came back to the East Coast, which became a theme or a jumping point. I then relocated to New Orleans. Louisiana came back to the East Coast to the no folk Hampton Roads area. From there, I went down to, um, South Carolina for Jackson and again, back to the East Coast of Notebook. Been down in Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, Cherry Point Area and back to, um, the Norfolk area. Now I'm a geo bachelor where I travel up to the Pentagon during the week, and my family is still located in the Virginia Beach area."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Where do you see yourself in 5 years?,"I see myself in five years still serving in the military. Um, I do not feel calling to get out at this point. Um, I'd love to have an opportunity to make 06 to make captain and serving. Ah, maybe ah Mawr senior senior senior role. Someplace in the fleet, I wanna build opportunity to mold other younger chaplains or not necessarily younger chaplains but junior chaplains and get an opportunity to make sure that they're set up for their ministry needs."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Where do you see yourself in 10 years?,"in 10 years. I see myself probably out of the Navy. That'll put me close to 38 years of service and some of the things that I envision myself doing is possibly working for a university, maybe doing some sort of education or development or maybe even taking care of veterans or are individuals that air are trying to do the same thing and get education and meet those needs."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What makes a good leader?,"I think some of the things that make a good leaders, first of all, good leaders read their students of history. They are understanding of what has gone before them and not doomed to repeat the negative things that happened before us. Um, their understanding of a wide swath of individuals, not necessarily their specific leadership style. Ah, good Leader also is someone who can look at its people and understand, um, their intense, different studies such as Myer, Briggs or Hogan Assessments, could be key in deciding where their individuals fit and also a good leader, I believe really gives opportunities for the people under them. Thio serve opportunities for the people under them to lead and take risks and chances. The leader's role is toe to take the responsibility off of them and give them opportunities to fail. And so I think that's where their development really shows. That's where they can really, uh, make the most money for the organization, which is the Navy. And that's gonna formulate their leadership style as they go forward and hopefully glean some, um, nuggets of what you have given them"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What are the most important first steps in a new leadership position?,"in a new leadership position. I really think it's important for that individual, um, to just rest and to take a look around the 3 60 view of what is going on and to not jump in and try to change everything all at once, to maybe observe other individuals who have a leadership style or potentially in a position that they would love to be in in the future and emulate that come alongside. Those who have been there, who have the experience, not be prideful, have an opportunity to give yourself permission to make mistakes and to grow upon those. But to really the first steps, I believe, is to not jump into anything. And Thio, just sit and wait."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How do you set the tone as a leader? What is the right tone?,"I think tones for leaders are set many different circumstances, and I think it depends on the situation. Um, I do not believe that someone should come in, um, too lax, because that provides a potential danger later on, because people are going to take advantage of that leader. But at the same time, I do not think that they should come necessarily off the top rope from the beginning. So I think, a firm, fair approach setting a tone. And then there's always opportunity to relax that tone and set, as as they move forward into a leadership style and as they move forward in the leadership timing."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"What are the most common mistakes you've seen new leaders make? (e.g., skipping steps)","I think a common mistake that a leader can make is to come into the organization or into the position and immediately change everything to throw, um, the baby out with the bathwater, Uh, just to put a finger print or a stamp of their style in the situation. I think what that does is it makes everybody else feel inadequate or that everything they have done in the past was not useful or good, and it really sets them up for failure. And for those individuals, Thio not trust you as a leader and not think that you value their opinion."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"What problems need to be rooted out early, or you'll have trouble fixing them later?","as a leader, its's very important to observe the people that are surrounding you that are under you and making sure that there are not things that are going to get out of hand. Um, something that's really going to disrupt the flow. And I think some of those things that are, um, trust I think that if if you as a leader can present yourself as a trustworthy individual, someone who is gonna maybe take the criticism from the higher ups and filtering it down to their people below them, I think that's a big win. I think that if you are the individual who continuously turns and points fingers, that is something that needs to be rooted out very quickly because people are not gonna follow you. And even if they do something to your face behind you, there are gonna undermine you at every opportunity."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How much leadership should you take charge of versus delegating it down to a junior person?,"I think leadership is something that you never lose. Um, you can't delegate necessarily the responsibility because as the leader, you bear that responsibility. But what you can delegate is the opportunity for them to showcase their skills and their opportunities to become a leader in the future. And so with that, they get that opportunity to to showcase that while you are still in the responsibility seat for any mistakes because you're gonna give them permission to make mistakes and to learn and to, um, kind of round those rough edges that they have in their lives and then come alongside in private and to correct and to shape and to mold Ah, that individual. So I think the leadership is continuous from the one up Thio um, the highest admiral in the fleet. I think we have all have those roles. We all have individuals that are looking to us as leaders"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How do I balance being close with my team versus fraternizing?,"I think a junior leader can still maintain closeness with their team without fraternization is if they're firm but fair. I think everybody respects a ninja vigil who is consistent in their leadership. That is not playing favoritism with others. That gives everybody equal opportunities to advance, to perform toe have those chances and maybe sometimes even reminding, reminding them that once they achieve a leadership position that this is the model it should ascribe. Thio and I think that it's it's a fine line sometimes, but it's definitely achievable, and we see some of the greatest leaders be able to accomplish that."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What are the main things that a new leader must learn and adjust to?,"one of the main things I think a new leader needs toe learn, toe, make those necessary adjustments, is they're not gonna have all the answers. Um, To surround themselves with individuals who may be experts and things that they're not good at is something key and something that they have to know that they're not the be and end, all of, of all information. I think once they can realize that and they can know where to find that resource and where to get the situation resolved, that will make their leadership opportunity much cleaner process."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How have your priorities changed as your career progressed?,"As my career has progressed, my priorities have changed. Um, in s so much. Whereas I'm not so much looking at my own career, but how I can affect others below me. What sort of things can I do as a leader, as a person to pour my knowledge, my skill set into them so they can then expand their path and they're meeting. I think by doing that, uh, it does affect me as a leader because their success and their good fortune ultimately pushes up to me. Even though that is not necessarily my intent. It's just a secondary cause. And both us, me and the individual, which I'm leading, reaps the benefit of that."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What does it take to really make a change in a team?,"I think a leader really has an opportunity to change a team. Um, and I think by doing so are the thing that they would need to do. This is tau motivate the people underneath them, allow them to see the vision that the leader has and allow them to grasp it as their own to provide ownership to that. Because if that is done, then it's It's no longer that I'm serving, uh, this specific commander and trying to get to their intent. But how are we as an organization or as a group meeting the same goals that we all have? And so getting buy in from those I think is can be ground changing for that organization of that division."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How has your view of this line of work changed over time?,"I think that my view of my line of work has changed over time by the sheer fact of my maturity, where when you first start off as a as a junior officer is a chaplain, you have a much more tactical mindset. The here and now, um, the daily tasks at hand, taking care of the people, boots on the ground to where I'm at now as a commander where I have a much more administrative or operational sometimes even strategic mindset. How can I change, um, the chaplain corps in the next 10 years versus How can I change my unit? So it really it's a progression of maturity and leadership as you go forward in the ranks."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What priorities would you recommend for a person entering this field?,"when you first come into this field, I think one of the priorities is to sit back and observe and thio. Look at those individuals that already there. I think the mistake is to go in full force and and try to take care of yourself. And in that case, I think many of the people that are you are supervising will consider yourself selfish. So I think that really as a leader, you need to observe those around you find who is doing what, find out who is the experts on certain things and get to know those. Hopefully you've done some research on where you're going, so you have a background. But I think that the first priority, really is that just sit back, observe and to see kind of the environment in which you're going into before you step into either direction of taking care of your own personal calls or diving completely into the individuals and ignoring your own career."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What skills do you wish you had mastered before entering your profession?,"some of the skills I wish I mastered before becoming the leader of where I am now is is that I wish I was stronger administration. I think administration is something that's kind of looked at as maybe beneath individuals, but ultimately can really affect people's careers it can, effective if people are advanced, Um, it could it could change trajectories of people's career. And so a good administrator, Um adds, I think, depth to a leadership position, and it gives them opportunities to really excel and to take care of the people that are under them."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What is one question you wished you asked earlier?,"One question I probably would like to have known early in her career is you know what is success? A za chaplain. And within my faith, success means something very different. It means my contentment, my service to God and how I approach that relationship and how I deal with people. Why, while success as a leader in the military, uh, much of it has to do with is my rank and my positions that I held in. Do the people who serve under me respect me and want to follow me and have the same intent? And so to really understand, that answer is, um, is yes to both, uh, the bloom where you're planted your position of authority, whether that's rank, whether that's location and bill it, Yes, do it all to the best of your ability. And by doing so, you serve both your spiritual side, which is your service to God and and both you're gonna do the people that serve under you, right? Injustice by being fair and honest and being successful in that realm,"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"As a leader, how much more will I know about the overall goals of the work I am doing?","as a leader. Your fortunately involved in much more of the discussions at a, um, or operational or strategic level. And so you are going to know more information than those that you lied. And that's a challenge because you want to impart vision and motivation but yet still protect the information from being spread to things or to people who don't need to know that information. So you have a balancing act of motivating and getting those who serve under you to buy into what the operation is without divulging every single bit of information that you know."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What was the most difficult part of your training?,"the most difficult part of my training both and boot camp and as an officer at ODS and Chaplain School would be, I think, having to start from ground zero, um, taking away a little bit of my individuality, to understand that there's something greater out there besides myself and to connect me with the group at large, whether it be in boot camp or other officers and the officer schools or even in a chaplain corps. And I think that's, uh, kind of a painful process, but ultimately enduring and worthwhile, yeah."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"You are having a conflict in the first few days in your unit, Is that normal or not?","I think conflict is normal. Any place where you, um, put human beings in a situation, I think some of that can be mitigated by observing and doing the research before you get to that unit and also being someone who listens twice as much as they speak and get an opportunity to really try to connect with those personalities, um, involved. Before any changes are made or any okay, sweeping movements are done in order to change their leadership style."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How can you lead honorably?,"I think leading honorably is something that's more simple than people. Um tend to believe. I think if you're if you're true to your beliefs, if you're treating people with respect and with dignity, I think the honorable part is automatic. I think that if you're honest and letting your yes is be your yes, is, it keeps things simple. I think Mark Twain said, If you wanna, uh, not have to remember as much just tell the truth. And so I think that if we can just be consistent in our leadership, that will create an honorable leadership trade."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"What are some good resources to look at before starting (books, videos, classes)?","I think there's Ah many different leadership styles and books. And just by a quick glance at the Barnes and Noble self help, I'll you can see that. But one that I have recently read, and that I think is really keen is Jim Mattis is book call sign Chaos, which breaks down different leadership styles and obviously, ah, very successful leadership style that he carried on through the Marine Corps and and then through civilian service."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What did you do with the Navy SEALs?,"So when I was stationed at Naval Special Warfare, an opportunity to be, uh, chaplain for one of the specific teams, and so that entailed me doing work ups with them, deploying with them and then coming back and doing the return of the union with the teams and being embedded with them was key because it wasn't just the chaplain making a visit in Afghanistan for a couple of days. But it was the chaplain that was serving with them that was living with them that was training with them. And I think it really paid dividends and gave an opportunity for some real ministry to happen. And it was a blessing to see how they grew into the opportunity of having someone with them to provide those specific skill sets."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What is it like to serve with the Marines?,"served with the Marines is always is always a good opportunity because the Marines love chaplains. The Marines love having you there. There is a role for you. There is a need for you. Like many other platforms or operations, the chaplain sometimes can be, um, second nature. But with the Marines, they're the first ones there. Where is my chaplain? And so having that knowledge that you're wanted and needed and provided it was never short of any work based on the age of the Marines having such young Marines in 18 to 24 year olds. So we were always busy, but it was a pleasure, and it was it was a great opportunity."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What are Marines like?,"Marines, Air dedicated Marines are individuals who have a purpose and have, ah, true, uh, warrior mentality of what to do when asking them to do a task. They go full force at it sometime without this without regard of their own personal well being. Um, but that's part of why we love Marines is because they're they're forthright. They're honest on, they're going to get the job done."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What is it like being a chaplain?,"being a chaplain is is something that no other I believe designator can to really understand. Um, because it za calling. It's something that we don't choose to be because we think it will be fun or an opportunity to do a specific thing. But it's something outside of ourselves. It's an opportunity for us to serve the God who has called us to do this. And it's an opportunity for us to to care and thio love all people regardless of their faith, and to really just live as an example of what we believe in, how we want to do business."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How do you love your enemies?,"Sometimes people ask me, How do you love your enemies? Um, in the military and for me as a chaplain and within my faith is there is there's differences between you know, first, for instance, there's a being murder and and killing. Um, and so loving one's enemies is something that's second nature to us because, well, the god that I serve told us to love our enemies, that its's easy for us to love those like us. It's easy for us to love those who think like us and our look like us. But it's a challenge, and it is beneficial to love those who despise us. And I think it's a key role, and it helps us as leaders. And it helps us, uh, specifically as chaplains as we go about our day."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How do you work with people with different faiths?,"working with people of different faith is is challenging for some, But to me it's an opportunity. It's an opportunity to learn others, because ultimately, when we're discussing truth and what we're discussing, what we believe is the way it's, it's an opportunity for us to really see the world through there. Their lens me, coming from a small town in the Midwest is gonna have a different observation of what life looks like than somebody from Southern California or from Bronx, New York. And so it goes the same way with somebody else's faith. And it just brings those opportunities and rich moments to really connect with humankind much like they would have, maybe in biblical times. For me, um, toe, look at people who speak different languages and their cultures, and it's just an increase is that understanding of God created people in all different shapes and sizes and beliefs and ethnicities, and Lord, that's it's a beautiful thing"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How do you work with atheists?,"working with atheist is is no different than working, working with someone who is agnostic or even a believer. Um, everybody has their own understanding of the meaning of life, and so atheism is really a belief in what they think is the meaning of life. So it's no different than someone who says there's a Christian or a Muslim or a Jehovah's Witness. Um, it's all in the same category, all comes down to a belief, and I think treating people across the board with respect and honoring them doesn't mean you necessarily agree with them, but it gives them a voice to their thoughts."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What kinds of sports and activities did you do growing up?,"as a kid growing up in the eighties, we didn't have one sport that we play like to do today. We we played every sport that was in season, whether that be baseball, football, the little wrestling. In high school, I was on what we call a ski club, and we did downhill skiing. Um, everything thio socially, with my friends going out, probably getting into too much trouble, but pretty much anything that was typical of those in the eighties and nineties."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What is a story that really shows what it is like working in your job?,"uh, one story I can think of that really kind of capsule. It's what I do and why I do. What I do is, uh, one specific time. I remember, um, while to play with the Marines in Afghanistan. Um, I have an opportunity to lead worship and to also, um, offer what we would call the Lords Lords prayer. And in a church, it's very formal with with gold plates and very reverent. But this particular opportunity was with Marines coming off of the battlefield. And as we pass around ah ah, makeshift plate with with bread broken up, tow watch and to observe, um, greasy and or bloody hands from individuals just coming back from air wing and from combat and dealing with death and toil and disruption. And to have an opportunity Thio have community together was really and really personal and something that I'll never forget"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,When is a good time to see a chaplain?,"a good time to see a chaplain is any time were available 24 hours today. I've I've received, um, some phone calls late at night. Maybe even individual is impaired or unable toe. Clearly speak where we could hopefully have a short chat and then talk later when the individual is sober. But really the right time to talk to a chaplain is is the time of need. Um, I think if you push it off, sometimes circumstances enter into your life and you may forget or suppress that that feeling, but it really doesn't do you any good, But so the best time to talk to a chaplain is is when the need is there."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How are chaplains different than other services available to sailors?,"chaplains air different. One key reason of the differences are confidentiality. If you speak to a doctor, which is important, or social worker or human resource is, or even those hired by fleet and family, um, you don't have that confidentiality. And so the commanding officer understands this and employs this. It's a federal mandate that when an individual comes and speaks to us, it's not my confidence. It's the person who's speaking me confidence, so I don't have the permission to share that. And I think that's important because it gives that one person that individual can really share literally anything in their life, whether it's a crime committed, whether it's a crime, that they're thinking about committed or something horrible in their life, that they don't want to get out. And so I think that's the one thing that a chaplain offers. Besides the spiritual aspect of the conversation that nobody else can have in the military"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"Is your field competitive, in that it is difficult to get an appointment?","a Sfar is becoming a chaplain. It it is, is competitive because I think in the military, in general, across the board, um, we're looking for the best and the brightest. And so, um, being a good minister or pastor or priest or imam out in the civilian world does not hold the same requirements, even physical standards that one must maintain to build to keep up with those 18 to 24 year olds. So a lot of people are disqualified just based on age or based on their physical standards. And then it comes down to the requirements as faras experience in education. So to become a chaplain, you have to have a bachelor's degree and a master's degree, plus at least two years of ministry experience. And that's not equal out in the civilian world. So I would say it's competitive to even just become a chaplain. And then while you're in the chaplaincy, if everybody is at that, high rate is just more competitive. Toe promote into advance"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What are your post Naval Service plans?,"after the Navy, I could see myself doing something in the realms of education. I always enjoyed teaching. And I really, uh, cherish the time I had as an instructor and I believe as a as a chaplain or a pastor. Our rule really is to take the complicated and make it simple. And so I think I see myself at a university community college, whether as adjunct professor or working in registration, taking care of militaries, uh, individuals, families, veterans and working that relevance mawr so than in the church."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Are you considering a doctorate in ministry? (DMin),"At some point in my life, I think I would pursue a doctorate in ministry. Um, there's been a few opportunities, but having Children of my own who are in education system right now, I think I'm taking a pause and maybe at my next duty station. If time allows, I'll pursue that."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What is critical to review when you start on a new ship?,"I think something's critical review when starting a new ship would be, um, everything from the platform. The personnel are key the demographics Before every person Chaplain really sets foot on the ship and starts going, they do. Ah, religious needs assessment. So what does the ship look like? A Sfar, as that's concerned. Um, what kind of beliefs are represented on that ship? And so I think those are all important things to really look at once, um, taking a ship."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Have you even been shot at?,"So, as a chaplain, Chaplain I have ever been shot at I would say directly. Unfortunately, yes. With the Marine Aircraft wing. On multiple occasions, we'd be flying low to, um, a location that we needed to get Thio and, uh, Marines do love to pick a fight. So it provided opportunities for the insurgents or enemies, too. Try to fire upon our our aircraft. So in that and aspects And when I was with special forces, we dealt with things more along lines of indirect fire. Um, I E d s, um, but most of those operations were done at night, and I was was not a part of those operations."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What is Afghanistan like?,"Afghanistan is like what you would see in a movie, but there are different regions. The first time I was there in the Helmand province was very desert, not a lot of greenery. Very, very warm and hot, very much like you would see on TV and second time in the in the southeast part of Afghanistan, near Pakistan. There was a lot of very lush and green areas, some mountains that you would not expect to be there, and it actually got rainy at the Times. Um, obviously the cultural, uh, aspect of the individuals that were there, I did not see a lot of adult females. Or in fact, I did not see any adult females in the in the year I was there, Um, in the mails that I saw were covered and depending on the villages were either sparsely populated or some of them were pretty large."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Are Chaplains eligible for combat action ribbons?,"chaplains are eligible for combat action ribbons because that is a ribbon that is not awarded by the command but by the enemy. And so if the chapel was in, uh, the circumstance that was given, then they will receive that if the unit reports the engagement."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Are senior Chaplain officers exempt from the uniform requirement to wear a sword at ceremonies?,"chaplains at all levels from junior and senior. Whether you're prior enlisted or prior swot are not authorized to where any kind of sword in dress uniforms do not carry weapons were non combatants, and that would be part of that reasoning."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Describe your ideal team.,"my ideal team would be filled with members with different skill sets, since I am much more of a visionary and I would definitely want to have people who are detail oriented, Uh, people who are gonna also be not be not afraid to tell me if something's wrong to speak out a two first sign of something that was incorrect. And so ultimately, I just want a team that is gonna come together at whole even though we're not all the same. Maybe we're all we have different personalities, which is fine, but somebody that we're gonna complement each other and make each other better."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What things do you always make sure to lead by example on?,"things I like to dio What I'm leading by example is the first thing I want to do is, uh, transparency, eso everything. I dio make sure that I'm communicating. Another thing I wanna make sure that I do is that I lied in my time. My time management. I wanna be the first one there before Everybody else I wanna be the last one. I wanna be a dependable And so when there is discussion about what their expectations are, they can look to me and see that I'm modeling exactly what I say. I'm gonna dio. Also I wanted, as I'm leading by example is is pushed out the fact that it's okay to fail. Um, so when I make mistakes as a leader, I wanna be the first one to step up and to admit to that and show that it happens and that we can move past it and you could still be effective by taking chances and by making mistakes"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What are some tips to earn the trust of my team?,"I think some tips that to really earn the trust of your team is to, um, being consistent with what you say. So even if it's something small, as when you're gonna be someplace or meet some someone at a location that you're on time, that you're consistent, I think once you start saying things that you don't do, the trust gets lost very quickly. And I think that goes outside of your circle. If you say things, the others, um, that are not true or that may come back to be, yeah, un effective, you're going to see that it's going to get back to your people, and I think that trust is also gonna be eroded that way, too."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How do you connect more deeply with your team members?,"I think one way to connect more deeply with your memories is toe. Really? Listen to not be thinking about our response or trying to one up that individual or to always say, Oh, I know what you're feeling is sometimes just listening. And as they're discussing their circumstances, you're just agreeing with them and understanding and empathizing the things that they're going through and not having Thio place yourself in every single situation. It makes them feel, uh, wanted. It makes them feel appreciated and cared for."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"How do I build trust between different team members? (e.g., new ones, ones with a bad history together)","I think building trust between team members does take time and again what comes back Thio taking, making consistency and making consistent decisions within them. So if I were mediating between them understanding that communication is important, sometimes we say something, but we mean a different thing. And so to build a clarify between those individuals what the actual intent is goes away from a lot of miscommunication, which helps foster trust, helps foster that relationship and gets them on the right track."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What are good strategies to have the right kind of presence with my team?,"I think some good strategies for your presence is being consistent with your personality. I think as you look at leaders, even bad leaders and good leaders, if you have somebody who is inconsistent, that you don't know which person is going to be there to greet you that day, that is the most worst environment you could be in so consistency. Whether if you're a harsh leader or somebody who is a little bit more firm, the consistency matters and the same thing. If you're ah, more laid back or relaxed leader, I think it's something that they're going to expect when they come into a situation as they meet your intent, they're going to know how to approach you, and so I think that is probably the most important characteristic."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How do you and your work colleagues socialize outside of work?,"me and my colleagues associate mostly, um, through just different activities that we enjoy doing. Um, I'm a surfer, so I enjoy social surfing with some of my friends or being outdoors and taking on things like that. Sometimes there's attending different sporting events together, going to watch a major league soccer game or, ah, football game or watching the Nationals make their historic World Series run last year. It just depends on the circumstances you find yourself in and really listening to those individuals around you and finding out what is interesting to them, not always going to the things that are the most important to you."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How should your relationship be with your subordinates ? (close vs. far),"I think all of your relationships, when it comes to work, needed to be on a professional level. It doesn't mean that there is not a family aspect of your circumstances. I think you can know intimate details about them, but I think there needs to be a line driven when you talk about what is what are we trying to accomplish today? And if our relationship is too relaxed, is that going to affect the mission at task? Or is it too stringent where you're afraid to come talk to me and share some details That might be, uh, important in our aspect, So I think there needs to be a blend and it comes back down to consistency and how we do business."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"How do I help my team prepare for a tough mission (e.g., inspection, long mission)?","when they're tough circumstances coming up. I don't think it does anybody any good to sugar coat or to shield them from what is expected, I think laying out the good and the bad eyes important. I heard a story from a normal Gortney who talked about, um, aircraft when it comes in and as he's talking about junior officers flying the the F 18 and he wants to know not just the capabilities, the positive capabilities of the aircraft, but whatever the negative things that we need to address. And so what we're doing is talking about something large inspections or some big task at hand. I think we need to know the shortcomings so we can address those honestly and get those up front."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What kinds of people will I work with that I should be on the lookout?,"I think the people that that you should be on the lookout for people who are self serving. I think people who are only looking for their own personal gain, professional gain are dangerous. I think there's, ah real threat to the team. If they don't have buy in on what we're doing as a whole or as a group, I think it really could sink the mission, and it could affect, um what the commander's intent is."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What kinds of people respond better to certain leadership strategies?,"I think most people, um, in general respond well to a servant leadership, um, style, because it enables you to prove and to showcase that you have been there too, and are willing thio do the same things that you're asking them to dio I think when we're talking about executive leadership, that becomes more difficult because ah, lot of people look to those individuals as the strength of the organization and for them toe to come down and to really get into the weeds is counterproductive. But in general, I think a servant leader is somebody that could be respected and, quite frankly, is someone that most people want to follow."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,When is it a good idea to share personal stories or emotions with members of your team?,"I think as a leader, when you're sharing personal stories that it has to be situational awareness. I don't believe that something you you lead off with or start with. I think there is a little bit of a trust, Um, that needs to be built up. But for me, as a chaplain, if someone comes to me and is struggling with a circumstance or a situation and me sharing maybe, uh, anecdotal, uh, similar circumstance might bring a connection to them. And they may feel, um, or kindred spirit and and share mawr information. Or understand that I may have a little bit of background in this and I can trust this individual, so it really just depends on the circumstance and situation."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What counseling skills are important?,"I think some counseling skills or characteristics that are really important specifically is be a good listener, being someone who is not necessary just quick to spout off with a response before you truly understand. And then when you're counseling somebody, or when you're dialoguing with that individual, to maybe repeat what you think that individual means. So you're on the same page and you're clear with their intent. But I think definitely listening more than speaking is the most important of the characteristics."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How do I work with my team to meet the standards? (if they are having trouble meeting them),"I think getting a team, um, to meet the standards that's having trouble is sometimes it can be challenging. But again, if we're transparent with what we're trying to accomplish, if we're accepting that there is okay, toe make mistakes but also understand that we can take that responsibility. And it's not how we get knocked down or how many times but how we pick ourselves up as a team, and I think if we can come together knowing that they're not doing that by themselves, I think that's one way that they can meet. Those goals and Thio get to a place where something that they're struggling on can really be overcome."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How should you reward your sailors for good performance?,"I think reward for good performance is done in public. I think it's done where everybody is aware that this individual did it, um, their hard work should be acknowledged. Just like I believe correction should be done in private. Hard work should be done outwardly. If that individual has been uh to you and has notified that they get embarrassed by that type of reward, then maybe you can alter it and maybe do it on a smaller scale. But I definitely think it needs to be addressed, and it should be done immediately, not ah, year later or six months later. I think it should be done on the spot or shortly after."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"What traits and experience, do you look for when interviewing new team members?","what? I'm trying to recruit new team members or interviewing individual. One thing I wanna know is, Are they teachable? Are they humble? Are they teachable? Are they willing to take, uh, instruction? Because very few people come into an organization or into a certain situation, truly prepared for what they're getting themselves into. And so if they have the base line characteristics or baseline skills that they need, whether that's education, whether that's training or experience, they meet that. And then I need them to be flexible. I need them to be agile and humble and how they go about getting to the level where they could be in active member of our team."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How should your relationship be with you're the people in charge of you ?,"just like you have a relationship with those that are below you, the ones above you should be similar. It should be a relationship of consistency, of respect, of the position. Even if you disagree with the personality or the circumstance of the person in front of you are, uh, immediately above you, you need to respect the position you need to understand that they were placed there for such a time. Is that And also you need to figure out is what do I need to do to meet the needs of this individual? How do I take care of them? How do I make them a better leader from my position?"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What would you advise a person in this field to get to know their bosses?,"in order to get to know your bosses. I think it takes time. And I think it takes perseverance and opportunistic when the boss offers ah chance to get together or a boss offers a chance to, um, fellowship, you take advantage of it and the same principles I would use and counseling is is I would ask questions and listen. Listen to what my boss is intent or listen. Two of my boss boss's priorities are. And then as I'm doing my work, as I'm trying to meet deadlines and trying to take care of what his intent is, I have all of this background and I can think like he thinks, and that would be one way that I would do to get to know the individual."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How do you handle supervisors who were unable or unwilling to give you feedback? How do you get good feedback?,"as the supervisor myself, I think feedback is extremely important. So if I were in a situation where my direct supervisor was not giving me that feedback, I would attempt to schedule a non opportunity to get their opinion. I think most leaders, especially senior leaders, are not short of opinions. And if you can play to that aspect in your life and just share and be transparent, say I really covet and appreciate any kind of guidance you can give me, I think you will get that either in a formal or informal fashion to help meet those needs."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What encourages accountability?,"I think one thing that encourages accountability is, um, your presence and knowing that you are going to be seeking that I think if if you ask an individual for a certain task and you never come back and acknowledged that the task was done or that a task was attempted, they're less likely in the future toe want to even conduct that task? So I think if if you get involved and not that you're in the weeds so much that you're in hindrance. But you're asking and enquiring about the product and and where it is on the the completion spectrum, I think that really goes to, ah culture of accountability."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What are ways you can identify the strengths and limitations for each member of your team?,"I think to identify strengths and weaknesses of team members really comes down to getting to know your people having conversations, and it may not be in a professional sense. Sometimes it's in a personal, um, engagement that you may have as a command together. Maybe you're you're all bowling together as a command to get to know each other, paintball or attending an academic or athletic engagement. I think you you get to know those individuals and you know their strengths and their weaknesses, and then when you're having opportunity to place them in those roles, their performance will be a great tell off what they're good at and what they're not, and to not be afraid to adjust those is going to be the key aspect of what a leader can actually do."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What is the best way to develop ones' skills in working in and with teams?,"I think the best ways you could develop skills within teams is really by practice. I think understanding what the intent is of the mission of the team, maybe what the mission of or the intent of the commander is and to get in and to really practice those things. Some people will sit and study and and research, but until it's actually done in real time, I think that's gonna be the true test."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How is it different to manage military people vs. civilians in the military?,"I think managing military people as opposed civilians really comes down to accountability. Military members have a different set of accountability. They have the U C M J that they have to follow, and they have rules and regulation where civilians are a little bit loosely based on that, there are rules and regulations on how to discipline a civilian member. How to even fire or terminate a civilian member is different than one of a military individual. And so I think the accountability piece really plays a role in that supervision."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What makes the Navy different than other branches of the military?,"I think the Navy as unique from the other branches because I think all the other branches are held within the Navy. For instance, we obviously are known for our our seapower and our ability to operate on the waters. But we also still have, um, ground elements that can perform. Is Justus Well, is the army such as in the Navy SEALS? And then, of course, we have our aircraft that are, uh, employed on carriers and airfields, just like the Air Force does. And then we still have even some small boats that made you Cem activities that the Coast Guard might participate in. So I think it's, ah, service that really encompasses all the other functions that the other branches have."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Describe an experience that illuminates Navy culture.,"You know, one experience I remember distinctly is being on a ship coming up in the dark. All the red lights are on and coming out onto the fantail and the dark and the stars and or even waking up in the morning on that ship, standing on that flight deck, looking down at the water and watching the dolphins keep pace with ship, almost as it's pretty protecting us or speaking to us and leading us into where we're trying to go."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"How do you help morale? (e.g., when the crew was supposed to go home but needs to stay active/at sea?)","you know, with morale, especially as a chaplain, a lot of times where the lightning rod, um, for which way it's going to go. So if we can, um, act in a positive way, since we're dealing with the situation ourselves with our own families, and so it's it's tempting to kind of get down. But we gotta have to put a good face on. We remind them of what we're doing is important again. We're not necessary telling them all the reasons we're staying longer. But I think with our attitudes, with our positivity and our transparency, I think that goes a long way with dealing with morale."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Who are the core team members (inner circle) who you relied on as a leader?,"so my inner circle as a leader will consist of almost always the same elements. So one is going to be, um, the leader. That kind of has, Ah, pulse on the executive staff. Um, you know, the things that are going on, um, with the ship, the vision of the ship. I'll also bring in individual who may be in the operation side for future command or for future engagements of different things that are happening to give us that perspective. I like to bring in somebody in my leadership team or within my circle that's dealing with with the medical side of the house, Um, people that is dealing with people like I am, um, individuals who could be either in the psychology or psychiatrist or even in just the medical team physicians or Corman rate. And then I also want to bring in somebody, um, that might be in the enlisted rates and maybe, uh, it could be in the junior enlisted rates or could be somebody. That's, ah, khaki who can speak to the day to day life of what's actually happening with the crew. Get us involved with the pulse of what's going on in that circumstance."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"If you have trouble listening well, what strategies can help you listen well?","I think one strategy you can use if you're having trouble with listening well is to force yourself to allow that person toe finish there frame of thought and then rephrase it back to them. And to make sure that you have the same intent many times, you'll rephrase something back to them. That was not what they actually said, and they'll have an opportunity to to re re speak it to you. And so then you can again practice that rephrasing until it gets clear in the intent is there."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What makes your leadership style unique?,"I think one thing that makes my leadership style unique is my transparency. I've been told before and actually recently, that people have seen me as a more junior officer and now is a senior officer that I haven't changed, that I'm still the same person, that if something is wrong or or even if something is right that I'm focused on it, I I am able to share it and talk about the details. And I think it just makes for ah, more trust. And it shows, I guess my humbleness."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What are some of the things you do really well as a leader that someone could imitate?,"I think a couple of things that I that I do well as a leader is is. One is I don't take myself too serious and I'm able to roll with the punches, understand that people are gonna be uncomfortable, maybe even around me, sometimes because of my position as a chaplain or a senior leader. Another characteristic that people might say is again my transparency, the way that I'm very quick to communicate things that I think is important, whether it's good or it's bad and also my ability to stay pretty consistent in my leadership style. A Sfar as I don't I don't waiver one way or the other. Uh, I don't get too high, uh, in emotions, and I don't also get too low. I'm pretty consistent and something that they can look Thio and expect from me."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What are the most important decisions you face as a leader?,"I think most decisions that we make conf all into a couple of different categories, and I believe you know, they're all really important. But there are some that are daily decisions on you know what, um, leave schedule. Are they going to take, or is there special liberty involved and other decisions that could be even a little bit more critical that have more ever lasting effects? Are, um which career path? Um, I'm gonna go down. Or if I apply to this officer program, how is that going to affect What are the 2nd and 3rd order effects of this? Is it gonna take me out of running for advancement in my rate or so forth? So there is there's important decisions with personnel, and then there's the personal decisions off. What would happen if if this marriage were to dissolve and were to separate, That would be a long last thing important decision that they would have to make that I could help walk them through. Or it could be his instances. What are me and my shipmates gonna do tonight would be an example of a quick, easy but still important decision"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How do I take lessons from officer school and apply them in real life?,"I think Officer school is much like a college or high school, or just any extended education is. Sometimes it's hard to see where the education picked up an experience took over. And so the practical things that you want to really focus on, I think when you're an officer school is maybe some of the anecdotal things that the instructors were talking about, the real life examples of how they applied the leadership styles that they're teaching in in officer school, and taking those opportunities to really internal internalized those situations and may be used for future decisions."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What do you need to know about yourself to lead a team?,"So I think it's critical that you really examine yourself and not just once but continuously to understand how to be a good leader. You don't need to understand your shortcomings so you can fill the shortcomings with people on your team that are gonna, um, take the take the place of your mistakes. And you also need to understand that, uh, maybe there's people that are too close to you or to similar to you. That may be redundancy and a team, but just ultimately understanding where you are at the time on that team, what your role is, even as the leader and how that's gonna affect the other team members."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What do you need to know about your team members?,"I think something you really need to know about your team members are there, right and left lateral limits. Um, what is there? Ah, capacity, um, to do a task. Um, what is their experiences in the past with conducting these things? Because there is, ah, fine line of of pushing them to a place where they grow as leaders themselves, but then pushing them too far where their they get so disinterested or frustrated with the process that they quit or give up before they get a chance to lead."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What are the most important factors about a situation to consider?,"I think really important factors of the situation is is yes. The results are are key and important. But what are the effects of the results? What are the 2nd and 3rd or order effects That are gonna, um maybe be a long standing after you leave. And so to think, beyond the here and now and the tactical level. But the really expand Maybe that 30,000 view toe look at the whole process and picture and what the results will will result into."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What are some secret-sauce tips for your leadership style?,"I guess when I'm asked about my leadership style and maybe a sense or phrase that captures it is don't be weird. People read you, they understand you. And if you're fake, they're going to read that, and they're not going to respect that. So much so where I've actually gotten a plaque and awards from other classes who have maintained that same motto of Don't be weird because it's so relevant even in today's military."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What leadership strategies are dying out?,"I think some leadership strategies that air dying out are are really just, uh, owning and taking responsibility. What I'm seeing a lot of is people pointing fingers and kind of walking away from an opportunity to really claim it and to fix it. And I believe that's important for subordinates to see you taking a responsibility as a leader, it shows ownership. It shows courage, and it gives them permission to trust you that if something does happen, that you will own up to it and that you will take that responsibility sometimes even when it's not your fault."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What are warning signs for problems in a team?,"I think some warning signs that you'll see on a team, especially when it starts to become a problem, is, um, self serving. You'll start to see people who, uh, forget to look at the whole team, and they start to look at themselves individually and they make it off track. They may lose focus on where they would be, and and really, it's difficult to trust an individual who's out there just for themselves and not to say that self can't benefit from a successful team, because I think that's an accurate statement. But to really just look at yourself as the end and be all, I think that's very dangerous on the team."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How can you enforce the honor code?,"I think, in enforcing honor codes and and allowing people to see the the importance of it. One way to do that, I think is is through history and to look at those who have gone before us and the successes that they had, the the the lay of the land that they are able to give us to the greatest generation and some of these historical films that are coming out midway in 1917. And to really see these heroes on live screen, I think that's a reminder of why we're fighting and why were honorable, even if other countries don't necessarily ascribed to the same characteristics."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How should I handle people who can't meet their standards?,"I think handling people who aren't meeting the standard is is Anak two of a good leader is coaching is to come alongside and and maybe address some of the things that they're doing really well and then focusing on some things that they could do to improve. I think incremental improvements, even if small, are big victories, and that will kind of snowball effect, um, to them getting to where they need to be with the rest of the team."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What kinds of sailors cause problems in a team and what can you do to improve it?,"sailors that I see causing problems. And teams are usually sailors that are out for their own interests. Um, they lose track of the focus of the team in general. Some of the things you can do to improve that has come alongside, and it kind of mentor them in the meaning of what we're trying to do, allow them to have buy in and ownership of the task. And I think if they can see that by helping the team as a whole, if they can see that meeting the commander is intent and doing the right things is really gonna benefit them individually, I think they could come alongside and get on board with them."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How do you get to the root of a problem with a team member?,"to get to the root of a problem of a team member is. Sometimes it's difficult, but it comes back to as a leader, knowing your people, understanding their weaknesses and sometimes your own transparency and your own opportunities to show where you have failed and have overcome that or have moved past. That will bridge the gap for you to really get alongside a team member who's failing and allowing them thio kind of hell from that and move on forward and knowing that most decisions in our life are not gonna end, um, there and that we have to move forward from it and they could turn out great things."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,When is breaking the rules okay?,"so breaking the rules is a non honor, courage and commitment mentality is is never really okay. And if if we're talking about semantics, if someone's life is in danger and a rule maybe needs to be broken to save the individual's life, and I don't mean just life and death but altering the course of their existence, so to speak, whether it's a relationship doing the right thing is never is never really wrong. But we have to understand that even if we break the rules for the right thing, that there may be consequences. But doing the right thing should outweigh those consequences."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How can I tell when someone can be influenced versus someone who won't change?,"I think noticing someone who could be influences versus somebody who probably won't change should be observed early on and as your as your leading and as you're instructing, coaching, mentoring, whatever the category of supervision you're using. If that individual is grasping on and and maybe taking some of the criticisms, maybe some of the the tips and the key items that you're giving, that's an individual that is worth throwing your information to those who are not willing to change, they're going to be in that situation. I think you still need to be fair and offer up that information, but just know and understand and not get your feelings hurt when they're not going to change and they're going to do their own thing."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What conduct issues can mean serious problems if you handle them in-house?,"I think there's certain conduct issues that need to be brought forth that should not be handled in house in house. You know, we always wanna handle every situation at the lowest level possible. But when you have conduct issues that are gonna affect the command as a whole, um, or it's gonna affect someone outside of the command. I think those need to be brought up to the chain of command and be brought forward many times with individual is gonna hurt themselves or another. Those are things that need outside help that needs to be brought to the commands, attention and things that are, you know, much more simpler that are only affecting that individual that can be resolved quickly. Those types of things that could remain in house."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Tell me about a time where your priorities conflicted with the priorities of your management,"So sometimes your parties will conflict with those of your management because, well, they have a different view and a different if they're at the strategic level and you're at the tactical. So there's been a time when I really needed to focus on the individuals at my command because they were struggling with a certain situation. But really, my management or my superiors wanted me have, ah, larger view of the situation and take care of multiple commands. And I was being spread too thin and I didn't feel like I was effective enough. So I had toe to make a decision. Um, do I want to do? It's what I feel is right? Or do I have to listen to my command? I ultimately ended up kind of doing a little bit of both and taking care of the people at my command, but also intermittently helping the other people that need that my superiors wanted me to dio"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What kind of risks do you need to take in this field?,"You know, we have, ah, lot of different risks that are presented to us, and some of those are authenticity of who we are. One example. I heard from a chaplain who was at a Liberty port. And in order for you to go off the quarterdeck, you had to actually take a condom with you. Obviously, they were having problems on this ship with certain diseases and different issues. And so this chaplain, being a married man, thought that was a inappropriate for him to take a condom. But yet he understood the rules. So at this point, he took the condom and he went on liberty and he came back. But he made a point to take the condom and put it back in the bowl to prove to him the rest of the people that he still had integrity, that he still honor that he was still bound by the law. But it wasn't gonna affect his beliefs for his thought process."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What problems or warning signs should you not try to solve and refer up to specialists instead?,"Yeah, there are. There are many problems that really need a specialist, touch to it or expertise. And I tend to look at things into three major categories. And those symptoms come in one way, shape or form in those categories. And that's the mind, the body and the spirit. And we see when people black sleep or they're not sleeping well or their diet is not correct or they're exercise. Um, those can really lead into a lot of different things where that person might be depressed, maybe going through some issues at home, maybe even considering, um, harming themselves. Also, we see that with with their mind, if if they're not actively engaged, if he starts seeing, um, symptoms of things where they just don't care about different things or they're disinterested, those also could be symptoms that psychiatrist or psychologist or a chaplain could kind of walk through. And and even from my perspective, spiritually, a lot of people who are struggling with that, um, could be a real symptom of something greater in her life of, of meaning, of Why are they here? What's the use of it all anyway? So those types of symptoms that you will see within the mind. The body and spirit are really opportunities for you to ask that person to go see professional help for them to go talk to the chaplain and allow the chaplain to kind of refer them out to either a psychologist or family life services or or just any place that they might seem would be a benefit that can really get them in the right frame of mind."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What do you do when given an impossible situation due to failures that you didn't cause?,"so getting an impossible situation, even despite things that I haven't done, is I look at everything in small bites. You know, there's a saying is how to eat elephants. You take one bite at a time. That's how you eat an elephant. And so I think that you look at it with fresh set of eyes, a new set of circumstances, Um, some positivity and you take one bite at a time."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"How do you deliver bad news, such as a family emergency?","Wow, it z never easy to have to be the bearer of bad news and it Z it's necessary. But I think that the best piece of advice I can give is be clear and be honest and only tell them what what you know. Don't speculate. Don't try to tell them that it's gonna be all right. And don't tell them that it's all gonna be over. You want to just you sit with them, you give them the news, you allow them to marinate in that moment of time and you just be there with them, you'd be still and you allow that time, even though it may be uncomfortable to really allow them to focus and to grasp what news you just gave them."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Why do people leave the Navy?,"people leave the Navy for multiple reasons. Hopefully, they're leaving it because they felt like they accomplish the goals that they said a task. What we don't want is people to leave dissatisfied and unfulfilled. And so sometimes I think people leave the Navy because they really didn't know, um, what they're getting into. They had a maybe a unrealistic expectation of what it was going to be like, maybe a location or station that they were going to be at. Maybe the how sexy the job that they were going to go to was going to be because it was differently in the movie that they saw. So I think that they have a sense of un fulfillment, and maybe that's due to also a lack of leadership. Maybe they got under a bad chain of command which discourage them and didn't challenge them or didn't feel that they were necessary. And so I think there's a variety of reasons, but really I think it comes down to what they thought they were getting into, and it didn't meet up the expectations"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How can I work smarter?,"you know, one way toe, I think toe work smarter is toe toe Look at history. And to look at what's been done before you, you re creating something that's already been effective. Are you or are you doing something that really hasn't worked? And you're just turning your wheels. So I think as you observe as you study the history of whatever circumstance you're in, that's an opportunity to find out what's actually gonna work, what's not gonna work and how to approach the task."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What else do I need to know?,"you need to know it's not about you. Um, this is an organization that revolves around teamwork that revolves around family and mission. And if you've joined the Navy, you probably have a sense of pride and history and of service. And I applaud you for doing that, and that's a That's a great feeling. And to understand it is greater than us. And I think generations in the past really caught that. That's why they're called the Greatest Generation. But it's our time to own that. And it Zito understand that it's not just about us. It's about the whole in general and what we can do for our country."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What's up?,nothing much just hanging out. How about you?
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How is the weather?,"Well, the weather is pretty good here. I'm not sure about where you're at."

,,hammen-eric-cdr,"If you could meet anyone in the world today, who would it be and why? What would you say to that person?","if I could meet anybody in the world today. I love toe. Meet Warren Buffett, Get some tips on finances and how to manage my money."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What person do you most admire and why?,"I guess the person I most admire who is no longer with us is the Apostle Paul, and the reason is the adversity that he had in life, the things that he struggled with, but he's still, by the end, held true to his faith."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Where were you born?,"I was born in a small town of Little Chute, Wisconsin."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Tell me a funny story.,"What kind of a funny, anecdotal story is the fact that I graduated out of high school with, like, a 1.7 GP A barely passed the as Fab was probably ranked 104 out of 109 in my class. And now I'm in a position where I'm teaching people how to be chaplains. I'm also in charge of the training education at the Pentagon for all chaplains. So if you want to go to graduate school, you have to come through me. So the person who can't spell has to really take care of your educational needs."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What is your favorite food?,I'll have to see. My favorite food is General Tso's chicken with fried rice. I'm not particular. On what restaurant? Just like a little spicy.
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What is your least favorite food?,my least favorite food is any vegetable.
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What was the coolest thing you did in the Navy?,"I think the coolest thing that I've done in the Navy and I've done many things, and one thing I can think of is getting an opportunity to fly almost every day. But the Marine aircraft wing in the back of a Huey with the doors open through the mountains of Afghanistan. And as we're taking off, they were talking to the tower and they would tell the tower they're ready to go. They have gas, guns and God, and they took off, and that was one of the favorite things that I can't remember."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What is the best military perk you experienced?,"the best military perk that I guess I would experience, probably has to come in line with my time with special forces and the the gear and the kind of the swag that you got along with that service. And so it's just a nice little perk tohave."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What have you done that got a lot press?,"not necessarily what I've done in the Navy, but an opportunity I had that I received a lot of press was when former President George Bush came into town and no fuck, I was able to be one of his greeters. They're an opportunity to shake hands and be part of his speech that he was giving to the Navy at that time."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How do write a good eval?,"when I start writing an evil or from writing even a fit rep for a junior officer, what I like to do is take uh, the commander's intent at our command wherever we're at. And I tried to synthesize their job and their input into what the commander's intent. So if they're meeting something specific, usually four or five priorities that they have, I try to interweave that information in there. What I try to dio is always right to the next rank above, where they're at because you're writing an evil to prove that they can do the next next rate ahead."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What is the best way to develop ones' skills in working in and with teams?,"I think one way, uh, that you can develop skills within a team is to observe the other teammates within that team. The find out where their strengths and deficiencies are. And how do you assimilate your own personality? How do you assimilate your own strength and weaknesses and how that's going to contribute? Um, to the team ahead. Sometimes that's gonna be require some additional training. Additional guideline. Whether that's formal training, informal on the job. The ultimate goal is that when we look around the team that we have people that are complementary to one another and they're able to get the mission done."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,When should you take the blame for a problem you didn't cause?,"I think taking the blame for problems that you don't cause is something that I think is diminishing in the military. I think at some point it could be harmful when the maybe the same individual is is repeating the same mistake over and over, and there needs to be some accountability. In order for that person to really get it, Thio correct it and to go forward. But I think as a leader, to develop some trust with your people, to take the heat off of them and allow them to really focus and function as a team. There is a time to take that blame, and especially if it's not gonna hurt anything in the long run, and it just proves to your team that you're there to protect them and they can trust you."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Tell me about a situation where your team and you had a major disagreement about how to handle something.,"so having a disagreement with other people in the team is common. And one example I can think of as I was standing, um, the chaplain Corps duty. We had a death on the base and I was the duty chaplain to respond. But instead of me necessary responding, I chose to contact their chaplain and their chaplain would not respond for some reason whether they were unable to because of location. And so my agreement was I think that it was appropriate for them to respond because they were going to deal with the backlash. They were going to deal with the how that's gonna happen with the family, and I would been there just for one day and they would never have seen me again. And so there was a disagreement on who is supposed to respond. And I was trying Thio look further than just the moment in the one day and trying to look further down the line of how is this gonna affect it? Long term"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"What kinds of issues do have you had to stand up for, that were unpopular?","you know as a chaplain were faced with a lot of immoral issues that come up. They may be legal in certain situations, but one issue that I can really remember standing up to and it's not common just to me is, you know, the fact of of pornography, within workspaces or within people's personal possession, to have to stand up and say, Hey, this is not right. This is You should have these posters up because we have mixed crew and this could offend certain individuals. And although it made me less popular with certain divisions, it was the right thing to do, and it made it a safer environment for everybody to enjoy and get the job done."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What struggles did you overcome to get where you are?,"You know, there was many struggles that I had to deal with to get to where I was. One, uh, struggle in particular was trying to get my degree while on active duty to stand duty and take care of all of my navel qualifications, but the same time go to school in the evening, Um, take care of my family and all the other array of other activities that got in the way of me getting my degree."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What is the most challenging part about your job?,"I think the most challenging part of my job is definitely having to deal with tragedy, having to deal with people when they're in their lowest parts of their life and sometimes even notifying them that they have, um, something serious, you know, having to notify a sailor that they have HIV or they had a loss of a loved one or just something terrible that happens and having to sit with them in that moment."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What is the biggest failure you ever had and what did you learn from it?,"one of the biggest failures I had in the Navy came when I was enlisted and I had an opportunity to get my s twas qualification at that point, uh, of my career, I was thinking about getting out, and so I stopped my s Twas even though I was only a few days away from receiving it because I thought I was getting out of the Navy. Lo and behold, I reenlisted and stayed in for another 25 years. And as you can see, I do not have my East waas."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What are the failures for which you are the most unhappy?,"some of the failures, which I guess makes me the most unhappy, is the opportunities I had to interact with others. Maybe missed opportunities would be more accurate, uh, chances to really build relationships and to pour into other people's lives where I maybe was distracted based on other circumstances in my own life, which took me away from that chance to really mentor and be with others."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How accepting of failure is this work environment when a good and honest effort was made?,"I think in today's Navy, um, specifically, with all the mishaps recently having within the ships and the ship drivers, I think failure is accepted a za long as all precautions were taken and it was honest try. I think that in order to have success in order to be to a place where you want to be a good leader, failure has to be part of the equation. And I think there is a book written called Permission to Fail. And I think that gives us that opportunity to, um, continue to make those attempts continue to want to be better and want to grow, and I think failure is a big part of that."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What are sources of support when you took a chance and the result was poor?,"I think some of the support that you you have when you when you take a chance and things don't work out, um come from different aspects. One can come from your mentor that is coming alongside you. That is, um, pouring into you, maybe a coach or a supervisor that has interest in your career. But ultimately, you always have your chaplain, and you always have your other counselors on board that have the trust of the command that could come alongside and help kind around some of those edges and pick you up and understand. It's not how you fall but really, how you get back up."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"How does someone recover from a professional ""bump in the road""?","I think if you do this career for any length of time, there's gonna be failures. I mean, we see that through, uh, inventors such as Edison and we see even see that in Scripture, as in King David with failure. So I mean, people have to be judged not based on the one failure, but really the the totality of their circumstances and the efforts that they've put forth. So I think if everybody's honest and they can look inwardly, they know that they have failed at some point. So when someone alongside them fails, there should be more empathetic and understanding and ready to help that individual get back to success."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What was a pivotal moment in your career/life?,"I think a pivoted, pivotal moment in my life definitely had to be when I went from enlisted to officer. I think there was a lot of people in my life saying that I couldn't do it or a lot of people in my pathway that said, This is not possible. You're never gonna make it. And then for me, Thio have certain people to come alongside and really be my cheerleader, especially my family. And then to be able to, um, accomplish that goal, get commissioned And then even at some point, to run into the same individuals who say that I wasn't gonna make it and see the look in their eyes and the and the doubt that they had turned into wow, this guy really did it."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What's the biggest risk you've taken in your career?,"I think the biggest risk that I've taken was actually becoming commissioned. So as an enlisted sailor I was. I was up for E seven. I had all the marks. I was a e p sailor. I had the backing of my community and I was I was poised to make Chief, and I had to take a risk of of actually getting out, finishing my graduate degree and start over as an instant. So I think, to go from something very comfortable to nothing to the reward now toe where I'm at 28 years later as a commander."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What is the most dangerous thing you've ever done on the job?,"I think the most dangerous thing would would definitely be my two tours in Afghanistan. Both from flying in an open door, Huey through the mountains of Afghanistan, being shot at with small arms fire to being, uh, poised with the seal team in a in a local village under Cem Cem. Scrupulous, uh, times and some very kinetic activity. I think both of those memories, I guess in recent past is would be considered the most dangerous things."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What causes the most stress in your job?,"The one thing that really causes the most stress in my job is if I feel that people can't get a hold of me. I've had a situation where I was in a building that did not get cell phone reception and an individual had attempted to call me because they were considering taking their lives. I never got the phone call. That individual did end up taking their life. And I only found out later that they did try to call and could not reach me. I understand it was not my fault this individual was reaching out for help. But it still to this day, uh, stresses me out when I'm when I'm unreachable to my sailors, to my Marines, to the Coast Guardsman."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How do you deal with stress on the job?,"to me, a dealing with stress and a job is really a three pronged attack that I always taken. I call it just very simply, mind, body and spirit. Uh, make sure that my mind is sharp. So I'm reading. I'm always learning different things. Body. I'm making sure I'm getting sleep. I'm eating a reasonably good food. 80 20 80% good food, 20% I can cheat, And then I'm making sure I'm I'm exercising. My body is moving, getting my blood flowing and then a third. And what I would consider the most important is the spirit. Making sure I'm connected to my God, making sure I have, ah, strong relationship with him and a group of fellow fellow believers to really keep me on task. So the mind body spirit"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How do you handle self doubt?,"I think everybody has self doubt. I think it's it's natural. We're human, we're finite beings. And so sometimes I just have to be reminded. And for me, I go to Scripture and it reminds me that I've been fearfully and wonderfully made that God knew me while I was still in the womb and knew the number of hairs on my head. And so for me, I really take it back to that Spirituals promises that God has already given me."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What kind of strategies do you use to handle fatigue at work?,"one of the strategies I used to handle fatigue is making sure I get a good night's sleep. I know it's a very common statement, but people not necessarily don't know how to do it. Make sure that the room is is dark and maybe a little bit cool, making sure there's no blue lights that your phone is. Is your turned off or turned upside down? Or that there's no lights coming in that you have the same pattern? That may be at a certain time. You You take a shower before you go to sleep and allows your your body thio start to shut down for the evening and that you're not looking at your phone or any kind of screen, Uh, almost an hour before you go to bed. Those types of strategies really can can really help you get back into a good sleep cycle, making you able to handle fatigue and stress at work"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How do you ensure that boring work gets done well?,"I think when you're dealing with a job that has some boring work or some some things that may be more monotonous and nature, you have to almost have a reset button each day. Look at it differently because you don't know the circumstances that air that are gonna be applied to it sometimes tying ah, vision or a strategy to that boring work because it may be boring at the level that you're at. But the things that it's helping others accomplish are crucial to the mission and making what you're doing that much more important."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How do you deal with an increase in tempo?,"I think living in the military, we're gonna understand that there's gonna be a increase in tempo, whether you're you're ratcheting up for, ah, deployment, whether it's something Connecticut's happening around you or their circumstances, whether it's family or within work. I think that you have to if you're taking care of yourself. If you're taking care of your mind, body and spirit, those types of things kind of mitigate themselves, and you can manage them much more effectively. Stress that comes at you is much more easily overcome because you have already taken care of, um, yourself in a different circumstances that you're dealing with."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What are common crimes people in your field commit that need to be watched for?,"I think anywhere where there's people, you're gonna have corruption, and you're gonna see crimes happening across the board. And I guess they really start very small level of dishonesty and maybe, um, of theft or stealing. And I'm not always talking about necessarily of equipment or goods. But there's crimes of stealing time, Um, and then being distracted on the job and doing different things that could be just did detrimental as somebody actually physically stealing something or an object from the workspace."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What part of your future are you most worried about?,"I guess the part of the future that I'm most worried about is maybe, um, specifically, in the military. What's gonna happen with our near pier enemies as China and Russia and Iraq and North Korea start to build up their forces? Uh, America is no longer the dominant superpower, and we're gonna have individuals that are ready Thio combat us and take care of us. So I think that that is probably one thing of my future that I might worry the most about."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"If you could change one thing about your job, what would it be?","The one thing that I could would like to change specifically at my job is the amount of administrative work that I have to dio. I understand that we're in the government, and with that there are so called red tape and, you know, steps that you have to take in order to get things done. But I'm a person who just likes to dive in and jump and do things. So the one thing I would like to change is all the different, uh, layers that I have to go through just to accomplish a simple task."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What used to be your biggest weaknesses?,"I think that my biggest weakness actually was maybe public speaking. And it's something that I work worked on to improve as a as a chaplain, you'd expect me to be able to go up in front of people and and talk to him and speak to them off the cuff. But it wasn't till I began a job teaching in between my enlisted. An officer career where I was in a classroom every single day in front of students were really honed, that skill to speak in front of others. And so I think now I'm in a place where I'm very comfortable that I can pretty much go into any size room and take care of the crowd and not feel nervous or out of touch."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Describe a time that you were put into an untenable ethical situation?,"There was one time where I was put in into unethical, uh, dilemma when there is a company that would donate K cups and Courage machines Thio the sailors and two Marines. And we had one company and they were all free and they're unsolicited. But one company delivered a semi truck full of K cups 90 pallets, and it was actually so many K cups that we could not, um, handle that we could not store. So what ended up happening? And as I had to almost speak to our jag but toe ask for sailors and Marines and Coast Guardsmen, whoever were stationed there to take a couple cases home for their own personal use? Um, the K Cups were there for the sailors and Marines and Coast Guardsmen to use. So it was one thing that I was a little uncomfortable with. But after talking to our legal team and, um, different individuals were ableto to clear that as long as they were active duty military, the company was okay with it."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How do I deal with an assignment that I don't like or that isn't a good fit?,"so we all get assignments and they're called orders for a reason because we're ordered to go to that place or that location. So what we tell in our community a lot is the bloom where you're planted. There is no bad job that it's only Ah, bad attitude going into that job. And so there have been many times where I've been sent places where I thought that would not be a good fit for me. But it end up being a great experience. I end up making some very long lasting friendships, and it actually helped my career and brought me to where I'm at now."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What things are there to do on a ship to reduce stress?,"when you're stationed on a ship, it's very easy to get into a daily routine that can be unhealthy. But there's also many opportunities to reduce stress from working out, finding a consistent sleeping pattern. There's usually multiple options for food. Um, that you can't eat some healthy foods and take care of that. And then there's opportunities to be with friends in tow. Relief stress that way, whether it's an activity of board games or video games, and also there's always a chapel services, whether it's through a chaplain or lay later assigned, um, that is an opportunity for us to release stress in that manner to."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Are you married?,"I am married. I got married in 1995 in June to my wife, and we've been married for almost 25 years. Got married shortly after I joined was E. Three at the time, and she has been with me all the way through and has had a military D card her whole life being a daughter of a former military individual, and we've been through a lot of different circumstances, but it's been the blessing, and I thank God every day for her."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Do you have any kids?,"I have four Children from the ages of 22 down to 15. 2 of them are in college currently, and two of them are in high school. And they have been born in different locations from Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico to Portsmouth, Virginia, and to two of them were actually born in New Orleans, Louisiana."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Do you have siblings?,"I have two older brothers. Both of them are, uh, eight and about 11 years older than me. They both ended up in law enforcement being investigators for different police departments. They're both now currently retired, and we still maintain a very close relationship."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Do you have any pets?,"I do have a pet. I have, ah, think almost a three year old Belgian Malinois that we were able to rescue, Um, from a very poor situation. I started loving the Malinois was when I was stationed with the seal teams and had an opportunity to interact with some of those dogs. But she is part of our family, and we would not go anywhere without having her around."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How much free time do you have in your career?,"the free time that you have in your career really depends on where you're at. In which location? What your bill it is. So sometimes when I was on shore duty and had a little bit more consistency, my free time was in the evenings and on the weekends, but on station, on a ship or with operational unit, the free time. Maybe it was on a Monday when days were slow, or I left a little bit earlier because we're getting ready to deploy for, um, for the for a deployment. It just really depends on where I was at. But it's pretty consistent, and it's pretty liberal. Um, when I given the opportunity so pretty good, normal amount of free time that you would guess."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How often do you ever take work home with you?,"Actually, my current job at the Pentagon is really the first time that I've ever had to take work home with me. I really am, Ah, believer of separating, um, your job from your family. Teoh, help protect that time. But this has been the first time, and it's been infrequent. But if a big project comes up in, there are deadlines that are on. Maybe on a Monday that I have to do some work on the weekend. I will do it infrequently, but it's not something I just choose to do."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Does being a leader give you flexibility to alter your work schedule?,"you know, being a leader does give you some opportunity for a flexible work schedule, but it also gives you a burden of responsibility to want to be there for your individuals and the people that work for you. So I believe good leaders will alter their work schedules in a more robust way. Where there, there someplace, maybe a little bit earlier, or some place a little bit later than the rest of their subordinates to model that leadership. And it's not an abusive situation where because their leaders, they take more time off."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How do your command responsibilities affect your style in personal life?,"I've been told that as I went up in the ranks for people who knew me on do Know me that I haven't really changed. Uh, my style. In fact, recent stories. I was doing a change of command and a za chaplain. I'm up at the front stage, and I always look to the commanding officer who is the senior individual at the event to see what is going on and how I should react how I shall wear my cover, etcetera. The last time I was at a change of command, I was the senior guy, and I realized that everybody is looking at me to see how they are to manage how they are to wear their cover. And so that was a little awakening that people are looking to me. And I just realized that no matter where you're at, there's always somebody watching"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What is a good approach for selecting a new duty station in terms of finding an area for my family to live in?,"when selecting a new duty station. I do always involve my wife and at some level, my Children. I look at to see what is would be a good fit, whether it's to stay to homestead and stay in the local area because of the familiarity or an opportunity for your career. Is it gonna balance, um, your career out where it's going to give you an opportunity to promote and at the same time be a good place for your family? So the strategy I use is I look at what we call an Alfa roster, which shows where everybody is at. Look at the window in which I am to deploy and maybe right down 5 to 10 different jobs that would be interesting and be beneficial for my family. And then I take time to really pray about it and to maybe do a little research about it. And so when I'm talking to my detailer or the monitor, whichever decides your fate, I have an accurate assessment of where I would like to go. What would be beneficial for both my career and for my family?"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What are the things I should prioritize when picking housing?,"the way I've historically picked housing was because I have Children. I try to find the best school system in the area, and there are many different websites that you can do to a team that information. And then I would possibly contact a retailer and try to rent location within that school district because the US education was the number one priority, and it always seemed to work out where there was an appropriate house for us to stay in the location of the school district that we wanted to go to."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What options do you have to transfer or change if you or your family needs it?,"You know, there are a few options when we're talking about changing a job that you're unable to complete, whether it's because of a family emergency or even sometimes personality. But there are rules and regulations as faras time on station. If it's overseas, it's it's much more difficult, but there is always a way out with humanitarian transfer. Um, sometimes we're dealing with a family situation and potentially ah, separation from your spouse, um, legal, or just something that you've both agreed upon. I believe that if you are speaking and communicating with your your detailer or the individual, that is, um, in Millington for you. Sometimes they can work other things out. Thio even transfer you at no cost, depending on the location. So I think communication is important to talk to that your supervisors and making sure they understand the situation"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"How will my relationship with my friends or family members be affected if I take a difficult assignment, and what advice should i give them?","taking a difficult assignment sometimes comes with additional stress. And so again communicating with your loved ones communicating with your friends. If you're able to even talk about your job because of the sensitivity, I think is paramount to understand going into it that this is just for a season, that it will be intense for a period of time. But hopefully after, ah, little while it'll go back to a normal and then at the same time making sure that you're really taking care of yourself, making sure that your, um, personal body, your body, your mental state, um, your spiritual state is where it needs to be before you go into that assignment."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How early should I get my family involved in the process of planning my next career step?,"I think when you're dealing with your career and a family, I think it za fluid ever changing evolution. So I am always, uh, having my family involved. Now they might not. My Children may not know the ranking structure, but they understand that if if if Daddy goes to a certain location or does a certain assignment, it's gonna help him in his career and understand that I'm doing this for my family, a lot of times gives us flexibility. And for me, they understand that I'm serving God and the circumstances that I'm going thio and so that eases their mind when there is a difficult task or difficult assignment on the horizon."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What has been your favorite place to live? Why?,"So far in my career, I've been multiple places from Puerto Rico to Louisiana to different places on the East Coast. But I would say my favorite place to live was actually in Columbia, South Carolina. I think it was a combination of the school system was fantastic. They had great scholarships for my college age son. It probably helped that I had a great community, A small town, Um, with a local church is involved, and it was just an opportunity for my family really to come together with the community, and it really became my favorite duty station so far."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What is an example of a conflict you had between your career and family life? How did you learn from it?,"so a conflict I've had with my career. My family life is something that I'm actually dealing with right now. I've been stationed at the Pentagon and my family lives in Virginia Beach. And so what I do is I go home every weekend to be with my family, and I live here during the week. And so it was a sacrifice that we had to make for, really, for the betterment of my career right now, understanding that this is going to pay dividends in the long run, but still the stress of having two of my Children who are still at home, that I am not there during the week for them, and now my wife is basically a single mom having to deal with things. But is it definitely a conflict that we're dealing with currently?"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How do you manage both career and family effectively?,"I think there's a balance when you're talking about managing your career and your family. Uh, for me, my family comes first, but at the same time, because we communicate and we all have the same goal of of good service and and being the best we possibly could be, we do make sacrifices. Um, you know, for the greater good. And so we really try to find those locations in those places that are both beneficial to my career and to my family situation."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What should I get ready to live overseas?,"I think having a support system back in the States is something that you really need to get ready before going overseas. I think a lot of things happen that you may have to keep a car back or have AH rental place that you can't sell before you go overseas. So having that support system, whether it's family, whether it's ah, Realtor, whether it's ah storage facility, all those places and things really will be integral before you head overseas."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What resources should I look for when I know I am moving to a location?,"you know, before you move to the new location or your new duty station. A few things that I like to do is look at the commands website and and see theon, Bussmann or the individual that's helping with the families. And there are a lot of information where they have of base housing. Maybe you wanna live out in town, there should be links, um, to some approved locations out of town. They'll even talk about the local school systems. There is, ah, lays on for the military to the local school systems. So that's an individual that we like to contact early. We like to talk and look at local churches and maybe places of worship that we want to. Dio and my Children were very involved in sports, so I try to find places and locations of different sports leagues that they might be interested in, and it really start to see what it would be like if we lived in that area."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What kind of things may fall between the cracks when moving?,"some things that might fall through the cracks is really when you're actually moving is the taking care of the details as far as having somebody there picking up your goods and then having somebody, um, to receive the goods. And I think that people regret not being more thorough in that situation because things get damaged, things come up missing, and that creates a kind of a mess on the back end."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What should I get ready before I deploy?,"I think some common things that you need to get ready before you deploy, um, to protect your family are are definitely is having a will having, ah, power of attorney that may be specific to buying or selling a home or possibly buying or selling a car. Also, just what you want to be done in case of an emergency, I think those are all important things that have written down to have in a safe and that really is gonna protect your family in case something happens."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How do you stay in touch with family?,"you know, some unique things that you might need to do to prepare overseas is really dependent on the location. Sometimes they may have a restriction about animals that you could bring over, and so there's a could be a quarantine. Sometimes there's even a restriction on what kind of vehicles that you have. Are you moving, um, to Italy, where the cars are much smaller and you have Ah ah, Cadillac Escalade that might not work. And so really finding out where that host country, what their needs are and the things that you have currently, and how does that fit into that new duty station?"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How do you ensure your family is taken care of when you are away?,"um, some of the things that are very practical that you have to get ready for you deploy, making sure all your household goods are in order, making sure your family has all the different things that they need. But one thing I like to do personally is, uh, make sure I have things on this ship that I'm gonna have or or if I'm out with the Marines, making sure And that could be anything from having cards with me or notes that I can send back having stamps, Um, in case that there's no conductivity, maybe having something set up. If I know I'm going to be a place where I can communicate, Do I have the right equipment? Um, to do that and just really trying to think ahead of what is not gonna be available on this ship or at my location and maybe bringing extra stuff in regards to that"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What are things I should prepare special as a leader when I deploy?,"so as a leader, especially getting ready for deployment there, there's a different perspective that you need to take care of. Obviously, you need to take care of yourself individually, just like on a plane. If there's an incident, you put the mask on yourself before you. You go to the person next to you, but as a leader, you're taking care of yourself. But then you're looking to the people that work for you and making sure that they're taking care of making sure that your giving them the resource is that they need Thio prepare for their family. The legal resource is the wills, the general power of attorneys making sure that they have, um, something to communicate with their family. So they understand the parameters of where they're going to be at the limitations that they're gonna have, and just things that are going to connect them back to it. And then the last thing I would probably make sure I have is some stuff that I can use to train. Whether it's something as simple as bringing some leadership books, things that we can read together and to grow together, and some resource is along those lines, I think those are all really key things to look at, especially as a leader"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How do you stay in touch with family?,"so staying in touch with family really depends on where I'm at now. I'm stateside, so I try to use a telephone and call them a ZMA, much as I can way have a thing with our family that we don't do a lot of facetime or Skype because it makes it more difficult when we see each other on the screen. So we old fashioned talk to each other on the phone and we try to do that as often as we can, um, to stay and touched, uh, some texting on occasion, Um, some WhatsApp, but not a lot of other avenues or crazy things that are going on."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How do you ensure your family is taken care of when you are away?,"One thing I do to make sure that my family is taking care of is you know I have. I have a wife who is extremely capable and and runs, um, things flawlessly. In fact, sometimes when I come home off deployment or from a long trip, I almost feel like that I am throwing something into the the smooth machine that's messing it up. So, you know, preparing my family over communicating with them, making sure that the things that they have coming up on the horizon, whether it's for school, whether it's a, uh, something financially that I go ahead and pre prepare for that to be done. That could be if I'm going on deployment, calling the cell phone carrier, making sure they know I'm not there or letting my bank know that I will not be using my cards to those things and services that I would not be using"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What is the best plan for if your family has an emergency and you are away?,"Yes. So good plan toe have in place in case there's an emergency, which the definition of emergency is. You're not expecting it, but one instances, I was deployed. I fact, I went with the Marines over to Afghanistan, and about three weeks into my deployment, hurricane came down the East Coast, where they had to evacuate everybody in that location. So the plan we had in place was having some readily funds available, some cash, um, that my wife could take in case the banks and the A T. M's were down. And we were able to use that cash to get a hotel room, and she was able to go far enough away with the plans that we've already established, um, to take care of that emergency. So really having a contingency plan, having some resource is available in case even a natural disaster happens. And I think that's the best way that you could go for planning for an emergency"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"What is military vacation like? (Length, accrual rate, types of leave)","I think one of the greatest benefits the military is the vacation opportunities. A za leader. It's a little bit more difficult because you want to make sure that your people are are taking the leave that they have, and sometimes they want to build up, but to encourage them toe to take some time off in between those long periods of work. But as far as a leader, I get a chance to take a vacation just like anybody else. It just have to be a little bit more conscious of who is going to be around and maybe the person, my deputy or somebody right under me, um, is going to be there while I'm gone in case there's any issues. But that opportunity to really sever your time from work and to really focus on your family is is key, and it actually pays dividends for the rest of the command."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What is the best way to be happy with your time in the service?,"I think one of the big secrets in the military of being content and being happy is realistic expectations. I know it sounds very boring, but if we go into a situation understanding, um, the intent of what it is, I think it gives us a frame of mind and allows us to really not to have ah pie in the sky type of dream, but to have a realistic expectation. And then when things go better than normal, you could be pleasantly surprised. But understand that you're you're serving your country, that there's a reason why we all raise our hand and and signed up to do this voluntarily. And so I think the satisfaction of that needs to be where we start and set our bar and to understand anything above that, all the benefits that come with the military, whether it's pay, whether it's, ah, the G I, Bill or V a loan are all really just that they're just benefits of something that we really were going to do anyways."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"As a parent, what habits from military leadership are helpful or problematic?","you know, as a parent, you see a lot of different styles bleed over into, you know, even parenting your Children. Sometimes I think you have to watch out to not treat your Children like they're your subordinates and understand that they're just kids. But it also gives you a skill set of supervision and maybe, uh, staying on top of things and not letting things get too far down. And and I don't think there's anything wrong with having high expectations for your family, and I think it makes you a stronger unit. But just to really understand that they're your kids, they're not your subordinates and to really be able to separate those two when you're dealing with them."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Where have you been in port?,"sure, I've done many poor calls in my career. Early on in my career, I've sailed up and down the East Coast from, uh, Portland, Maine, area down to North Carolina. Thio, pick up Marines, and I've even done a port call from, um, the east coast, through the Panama Canal to Rodman Panama. And from there we sailed up to Hawaii and over to Australia, where we sold our ship, um, to the Australians, Another ship that I was on, I went over to the Mediterranean and spent time in different ports in Italy, Israel, in Turkey."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Where were you stationed and what was it like there?,"Well, I've been stationed at many different places that I always seem to come back to Norfolk, Virginia, area. So I had a couple ships out of Norfolk, and I think it's a great location. It has the beach. It has a lot of different things for families to dio bin Station over and Roosevelt roads Puerto Rico, which is no longer a station. But that was a tropical island. But after a while, it did become an island over to New Orleans. Louisiana is exactly like you see on TV with Mardi Gras on Bourbon Street and and all those different things, but it had a very good family atmosphere when you really peeled it back back again to Norfolk area and now up to Washington, D. C. Where things are pretty hectic. Um, in the middle of all the political, um, hoopla. And but my family is not here with me, so they're not enjoying, um, that family portion is also stationed down in Fort Jackson, South Carolina. Very small town, um, community we loved it, had a great opportunity for my kids in school, um college and just family time"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What things should I prioritize when moving to a new location?,"So when moving to a new location, the things that we really prioritize, especially with a young family and with Children, were the school system. We would find the best school system that we possibly could public school system, and then we would try to find ah, place in close proximity within that school district. That's usually our first thing that we did a zey young family."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,When do you get to choose if you are going to live in post or off post?,"I think each location has a different waitlist than on and off base, and I assume it's really depicted by what is the cost of living out in the community. So if you're going to ah, San Diego or ah, place where it might be more expensive, I think the housing is going to be a lot more coveted because people can't afford it. So I think early on, as soon as you get your orders, your hard copy of orders is the first time you need to communicate with the housing office and whether or not you're gonna live on base. I think that's key because it puts your name high on the list. So when the opportunity comes and when you do get to your location, you will be higher on that list or you can take yourself off if you choose to live out in the community."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,When do you need to find your own housing?,"I think there's times when you need to find your own housing. Um, for instance, if the housing is wait, list is too long and you're not able Thio, get in at a normal time. Uh, maybe it doesn't meet the needs of your family. Maybe the house they're gonna give you is to small and you want Ah, larger room. Another thing that they think about us faras when you'd want to be out in town, is maybe your B H is at a level where it's more than you need to live out in town. So your ableto maybe save a little bit of money by living out in town than by going on base where they take your entire BH."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,When should I own or rent?,"I think owning and renting really depends on your comfortable ity of having or being a landlord. If you're going to be at a location for three years. I don't think it's a bad idea. Thio by, ah, property that's affordable. Nothing outside of your range, living it for three years and then possibly turn it into a rental property. Now, mind you knowing the history of that area and knowing that there's always going to be military people around, that would be a safe bet to do, but really depends on your comfortable Ah, you know, attitude towards having a rental apartment, but buying if you're there for a long enough, if you're there for a short amount of time, I would consider renting."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What types of services are easy to find vs. hard to find on a Navy base?,"I think one service that is almost never, at least in the Conus or the United States found, is our our public schools. Within. There are a few bases that have middle schools, elementary schools and high schools on the base I can think of in Camp Lejeune, but typically it's on Lee overseas and that that would be very uncommon if you went to Ah place and they had a school system on the base for your kids to go to."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How often will I have to move?,"well, it's said that no good deed goes unpunished so many times. If you are Ah, sailor, that is successful and doing well in their job, you might find yourself moving more frequently like myself. I've always been asked to go different places that were the next challenge. But typically you can expect anywhere from between 2.5 to 3 years having to move someplace. If you're in a major fleet concentration, whether it's a notebook or San Diego area, you may have an opportunity to stay within that region and to still be competitive in a different bill it."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"Can you use outside communication on a deployment, like using the internet and email, calling by phone, and writing mail?","you know, while unemployment, there's many different options nowadays. When I joined in 92 my active communication was writing letters and numbering them to make sure they got there in sequence. Um, but since the last time when I went to Afghanistan, we actually had WiFi in Afghanistan village where people could Skype at home and talk to her family in real time. So it depends on your circumstance in your situation, whether you are in a place where maybe they cut the Internet down for security reasons, but mostly you'll have opportunities to use technology to communicate with your loved ones."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Can you drink alcohol when deployed?,"when you're deployed, it really depends on your location whether alcohol is permitted. Um, if you're going thio Analogy Country over in Europe, when you're on port call, you can drink responsibly. Um, if you are over in the Mideast where it is prohibited there, then you will not be able to drink. They will have non alcoholic beverages there that may taste like beer. Um, there's also certain circumstances. If you're underway for periods of time, they may pull into a location and have some alcohol along with them and put it out on the pier for individuals to have a couple drinks and to have a little downtime."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What have you seen people spend a bonus on that worked out well?,"I think when people get bonuses, um, I would say most of the time they abuse it and buy something with it. I e. A car or motorcycle or something that would be considered perishable and not maintaining its value. Where I've seen people really succeed is by taking their bonus and investing in it and putting it into something much more reliable, maybe adding it to their their TSP. And I know it's it's not sexy and it doesn't satisfy their needs right down in there. But in 20 years, when they retire, they're gonna they're gonna be really glad they did that."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What kind of lifestyle can I afford as a junior officer without going into debt?,"I think a junior officer can afford a very comfortable lifestyle. Um, whether they're single, they probably have a little bit more expendable income where they can probably purchase. Ah, very modest place to live. They could have a new opportunity. Thio have social, social life and and live pretty much normally. What ah, starting career would be with family. It's a little bit more difficult, because now you're you're having to deal with potentially school expenses, um, extra food, extra insurances and things of that nature. But I think very comfortable. As anyone would say, maybe a police officer, fireman or just a earlier beginning manager would be very much similar lifestyle that they could live."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How do taxes work in the military?,"so taxes in the military work a little different. Where, when we are receive R W twos RB HR. So our housing is not included, so that's a large portion. So it's it's very good. Um, for us, it makes it looks like we make less money. Um, there's also opportunities when we deployed a certain locations where we're not taxed, and that is also ah, benefit for us. But ultimately it really works. The Samos faras our investment, whether it's a Roth investment, whether it's traditional pre or post tax and then also finally, in our preparation, there's there's a lot of different opportunities for our us to get our taxes prepared for free and taking care of that way."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,When do I need to worry about retirement?,"I think, um, any individual who joins the military should really, um, could start considering retirement because we know that compound interest works mysterious way in the earlier you start, the better off you're gonna be. And even if you do not decide to make the military career with the new TSP system, they're matching funds, and you're able to take that money with you at your next career. And if you have a federal career, you could just continue in the TSP, um, system. And if not, you could take that money and it's still gonna grow. So I think early is better. Um, I think if you spend everything right away thinking that you're just gonna you're gonna be fine in the future. That's when you see people struggling as they get ready to retire."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What benefits should take advantage of more?,"I think one really main benefit, uh, that people don't take advantage of is really maxing them out there. TSP The TSP is I don't work for them. But it is probably by far the best investment that anybody can have, whether in military or in the civilian world, because of the cost and the matching. The second benefit I would like to have seen people use MAWR is their g i. Bill. Um, people say they enter the military to get college paid for, but many times they they don't and ends up going toe waste. So I suggest either use it, pass it on to your spouse or your Children."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How is travel paid for?,"Navy order orders are authorized through the orders. And so they're they're paid for by your your detailer. Any stops in between are covered for that, um, the big kicker that you We have to realize that once we execute those orders that as soon as we get to our location that we go into our DTs and we make sure that everything is, um, taken care of if we received a d l A or advance, um, types of pay that those are all accounted for and accepted. And you really wanna liquefy all of our things within 10 days that you get there in order to make sure that there's no overpayments and make sure that and to make sure that you've got all the money that is owed to you"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What kind of hobbies do you have time for?,"I think the Navy, just like any other time or any other occupation really gives you opens up the opportunity for any activities. I know myself, I enjoy surfing. So when I get stationed over in places such as Virginia Beach, I have an opportunity to go out in the water. Now I'm here at the Pentagon. Not a lot of surf here, but I could take a stand up paddleboard into Potomac. But really, any activity that you enjoy a civilian is almost a zoo. Long as it's legal, it's acceptable within the military. And just depending on where you're stationed, um, depends on what you can dio."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Have you been in the Navy when a child of yours was born?,"So all four of my Children were actually born while I was on active duty, and two of them were born on naval bases and naval hospitals, one in Roosevelt roads, Puerto Rico and one in, uh, Portsmouth, Norfolk. And two of them were born in civilian hospitals in New Orleans, Louisiana. All great experiences, all covered, um, costs covered, no issues with any kind of reimbursement and all born healthy and having no issues."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"If you become a parent, does the Navy provide OBGYN and delivery services to you?","You know, the Navy is covering a lot of different ground nowadays, and we have a lot of different specialists, and one of them is the O B G Y n. My wife is a civilian, married to me on active duty and always had good care, whether it was through a civilian practice or through a military hospital. And she does had no issues. And I even here, if you are stationed in Japan that those individuals who give birth there get their hair washed while they're in their rooms, they get massages, so even cultural benefits toe where you're going."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"If you become a parent, what issues arose around your having the baby?","obviously becoming a parent stressful and requires time both to take care of your spouse because they're gonna be down and just going through childbirth and spending time with your new child or baby. So I think communication with your chain of command is first and foremost. I don't know any leader who would not want to give their sailor or Marine an opportunity to spend time with their family, but also understand that there are sometimes limitations where you are in a location where you can't necessarily make it back. And so having those, um, those conditions with your family back home to make sure that they're taking care of is also an important feature."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What types of questions can I ask you about?,what types of questions can I ask you about?
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What happens if you attrit or a particular officer path doesn't work out?,"you know, it is very common for an individual to start down one path and maybe fail or voluntarily step out of it. And so it depends on on the career that they're looking into it. If you're trying to get into buds, for instance, many times they ask for an alternate rate that you may want to go into in case, um, that does not work for you. But I found that even in my own career, starting off of the radium in which converted to an I. T. I, I transferred over to legal men when my interest changed, and now I'm a chaplain. So I think there's many different pathways. One end of one pathway does not mean failure. It just means that opportunity for a new pathway."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"When you were at a duty station, do you often get travel to other sites on TDY or TAD?","So as ah young enlisted individual, I rarely went to different sites t d y, unless it was to a school that they needed me to attend. As I became more of a leader into a leadership position and now into the rank I am out, I find myself traveling a lot doing training, taking care of other individuals, Um, just meeting general needs, but getting an opportunity to get on the road a lot more."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Describe how the arrangements for travel and housing are made for TDY or TAD?,"when you have to travel for the military, T D Y or T 80 for a time frame usually are authorized by your command. You go in through DTs and build your ticket. And sometimes if it's a plane or rental car and all the different things you might need once that's approved from your command, you go on your trip and you have to pay for the trip yourself, at least initially. Whether it's through a government credit card that you're issued as soon as you come back from that trip is your responsibility to quickly liquidated, We think within five business days, it's then approved by your command, and normally you get paid within 72 hours of that."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What is the advancement potential in the field? What is a typical path?,"So currently I serve as a chaplain and chaplains come in as a lieutenant J. G because of their vast graduate school time that they've spent, uh, there from there, it's a pretty typical path like it would be for any other officer. You know, 4 to 6, you get one year as a G 4 to 6 years as lieutenant. That's about a 70% advancement rate to lieutenant commander, another four or five years as lieutenant commander and another 40 to 50% is a commander and then another 3 to 5 years as a commander, Thio captain. And so the potential is there, Um, it depends on the individual and the opportunities that they have taken while they were in. But it's it's something that is it's a fair process. I have seen it myself, a za recorder on the board and you get excited and it seems like it's a good opportunity for individuals to advance"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Are there special provisions for chaplains staying in longer than for line officers staying in?,"So I think chaplains are a unique designator because many chaplains who come in are maybe a little bit older because they realized they want to serve at older Date. So really, the youngest ah, person could be as a chaplain if they wanted to be a chaplain. Since age 18 is around 26 or 27 um, with all the qualifications. So there are some provisions for the people who are even over 60 to get waivers to continue on active duty. Um, but it really depends on the needs of the navy and where they're stationed, and the bill is that they're feeling."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What is a good strategy for setting goals and priorities to advance?,"I think the best strategy for enlisted or officer and setting goals and priorities is to really look at your commander's intent. Every commander has a list of priorities that they have, and so they list those priorities, and it's it's really your job as a leader and as a follower, too. Really grasp those priorities and see where you fit in those points when you write your evil or fit rep, you write how you met those priorities, and I think that's really your best, um, case to advancement in your best opportunity."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What are the most important things on a resume?,"I think the some of the most important things that can be listed on your resume is his leadership potential things that you have done, whether it's whether it's your bio, your resume within the military or out in the civilian world. Thio bail for the person who is interviewing me, you or observing, you are sitting on your board to see your potential. The things that you have done, Um, and the sky's the limit there. I think if you write things down on your resume that just show menial tasks that you have accomplished doesn't show that to your potential."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Where can a person get access to a new role that will help me advance?,"I think every command has a list of either collateral duties or jobs that may be coming available at the command, and I think that's key to to be in communication with that. If it's something a new role that you potentially may qualify for at the command basis, apply for it. If it's something outside the command, something that comes out Navy messaging sometimes sends out things. For instance, there's a message looking for, um, interns working for the justice system up in D. C. If that seems to something that you would fit, you can apply for those types of things talking your chain of command, getting that sometimes you look for foreign service officers, maybe you speak a different language, and that's something that you'd be interested in. So you would again just go through the channels that air within the Navy message and apply for those opportunities"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Who are all the people I should talk to before making a major career choice?,"I think the Navy within their publications has a really big push for mentorship. And that's somebody that may not necessarily be like you, but someone that you could come alongside to grow, maybe someone that you aspire to be. So before I make choices, I obviously first go to my family because it affects them and their well being. And then I will go to individuals that I have trusted over the time, not someone who if it's a marriage situation, I'm not gonna ask the person that was divorced five times I'm gonna talk Thio, maybe the chaplain or maybe someone who has a marriage in which I respect. If it's a career issue, I'm gonna look to people who are doing good things in their career, maybe people who are the ones that are on top and so on where they want to get Ah, good grasp of many different circumstances around me so I could make the best decision"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Who gave you the best advice about your career?,"So I've been blessed to have at least somebody at every command that I can tow, lean into whether it was N. C. One on a ship or whether it's just my direct supervisor as a chaplain. But I try to surround myself with people who I respect. Maybe they are not like me. Maybe they're different denomination or ethnicity, or they have different beliefs or thoughts. But I respect them for their accomplishments and the things they do. So it really depends on where I'm stationed, because along the lines of somebody who wants to support you, there are always people who are going to doubt you and say that you can't do it or giving excuse why. So you have to have discernment and who you're talking thio and understand. Those are the people that you want to follow."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,In what ways would your career have benefited from better advice?,"I think in my career getting better advice is not necessarily a smudges. Me listening to that Good advice. Um, sometimes we get something in our head that we think we should dio or we go a direction because maybe we're immature or and we're just not don't have the experience. So if somebody that is in a position of authority who has been there and done that is giving you advice, I would I would try to take it as much as possible, as long as it doesn't go against your conscience and maybe even against some of your emotional feelings to not do it."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How can I tell who I can really rely on?,"telling who you really can rely on is somebody who has been there through thick and thin, not just taking advantage of you. Maybe not hitching their wagon to you because they cease, um, potential. But somebody who is is also gonna be honest with you, even if it's unpopular. Um, they're willing to tell you the truth, um, whether you're messing up, whether you're doing great and they give the shoot straight with you."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What advice did you listen to from others that helped you advance?,"I think some very general advice that I've been given, even from my detailers, there are no bad assignments. The bloom where you're planted It sounds kind of hokey and kind of like an excuse. But if you really think about it, um, you could make a difference Anywhere you go, whether it's for me, it's in a chapel stateside where it's not too exciting. It's a bunch of retirees or whether you're at the tip of the spear with the Marines and the Navy seals. Both sets of people need you. Both have other rewards. Um, for you if you do well and I just think it shows consistency to the leadership and it shows that you're a team player."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What advice did people tell you that you wished you had heeded?,"some advice that people have told me that I wish I heated was close things out. Well, eh, So I have a tendency to be a visionary and all over the place, sometimes in a good way. But when I get the next set of orders, I tend to lose a little bit of focus. I don't drop my pack. I still work hard. But to really set that person up that's coming behind me. Um, to really finish strong, I think, is the advice that I've sometimes didn't heed what I should have."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What question have I not asked you that I should have asked you?,"So one question that I think is important for us to realize is when we're talking about mentorship in a relationship, it's not just the mentor teaching the mentee. I think there's a lot that the mentee can really teach that mentor. It's both ways. Not only that is, I think even if you think that you're at the bottom level and you're the one being mentored, there's always somebody below you that needs the same type of mentorship. So as you are seeking out a mentor, you should be seeking out someone that you can mentor yourself, and I think that will be very holistic for you. It gives yourself a 3 60 view of your own personality and would be beneficial both ways."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What range of tasks and opportunities does this field present to allow me to grow?,"I think with all things being equal, I think the best way to do it is to go to college earlier than later. Um, there's nothing wrong with going to college later. And in fact, sometimes your experience and the things you have gone through makes you appreciate it more. But I think going to college earlier sometimes limits maybe the other things, that responsibility that you may have later in life. For instance, I went to college and I had Children. I went to college. I had two Children at the time, and I went to graduate school. Had four Children at the time, so the responsibility was greater is a little more difficult, but it also gave me a different view of how I how I learned and the importance I put upon it."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Should I go to college now or after serving?,"Okay, so the chaplain Corps is unique. Um, specifically, we're talking about growth. So we serve the Navy, which has its own, uh, you know, dynamics with you have. See, you have air, you have sub, you have special forces, you have the CBS and you have different communities, the medical community, all of which we serve. And at the same time, the Marine Corps utilizes Navy chaplains to serve for them. So within the Marine Corps, you also have the air wing, you have logistics, you have division with the ground, and you have re kon and Special Forces with the Marines. And finally, we also served with the Coast Guard. So then they have the different small bases all around the nation that you could serve at within the Coast Guard and even some with the Merchant Marine Academy. So working with civilian crews on this ship. So the diversity that the Navy offers is unparalleled to any other service and really any other job"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What leaders do you look up to for guidance?,"So I look up to different leaders that get put in front of me, whether it's my direct supervisor or maybe an individual that I've had in the past, that I have continued a relationship with but not only leaders that I looked Thio and the person that I looked to. Leaders that are on book, uh, like like reading about leadership, whether it's John Maxwell talking about leadership or maybe even a pastor who I who I like, or just different authors who may produce material based on leaders always never to repeat history. Um, it's a good thing to lead and to read about leadership."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What opportunity would I have to change careers/fields?,"I think the opportunities to change fields or professional fields is endless. I think we always are students of learning, and we always should be striving to do our best. So I think if we have everything taken care of all of your calls, air done and and you're ready for the next challenge I don't know any supervisor who would be disappointed with that person reaching for the next challenge. I myself went from a radioman to a legal men to a chaplain, Um, not neglecting my current job, but always looking ahead. So what is the next challenge?"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How can I request to work in a certain area or field?,"I think when it gets into your window for an opportunity to discuss your next assignments. I know as officers we have detailers and depending on your circumstance, if you have a e f m p family member, you can start talking 18 months out. If not a lot of times they want to start dialoguing with you for a year as the detailers responsibility, finale your family, but your career. And I think with open communication, understanding what you need and you being realistic about what's gonna help you the best. That's when you can really get the best opportunity to serve."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How much value does your organization put on education and training?,"So my community is very educationally based, since we have to have, ah, masters of the Vinny Thio even start, which is equivalent to a J. D in law school eso you'll find a lot of chaplains get their doctorates, maybe even get there. J p M E one and two, um, some of them get th ems. All of it put on your fit reps and within your record will be beneficial as you move up the ranks, not only with someone selecting the next to advance, but you understanding the environment that you're going into because of your education."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How do the educational benefits of the Navy work?,"I think educational benefits in the Navy work in different ways whether you're enlisted and you utilize, uh, tuition assistance or even some officers. So because I'm a chaplain already with a master's degree when I enter, I do not qualify for those things. But however, I do qualify to use my G i bill if I needed Thio. And there's also programs within the chaplain corps that sends, oh, Force elects Thio another graduate degree. There is, uh, programs that sends us to the war college and also to hospitals to do clinical pastoral education."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How will my experience transfer to civilian jobs outside of the Navy?,"so the Navy has done a really good job realigning even the names of their ratings to make it Maura aligned with civilian counterparts, For instance, uh, cooks used to be called mess specialist, but when they went to get a job out in town as a cook or a culinary person, they don't understand what a mess specialist was now their culinary specialist. So getting a job coming from a culinary specialist Avenue is easily aligned to the civilian world, and so they've done great pains to do that, also to upping their qualification. So, for instance, ah, legal men now will leave the Navy with the peril legal qualifications that will transfer right into the civilian world so continuously working on those opportunities."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Who has influenced you the most?,"actually, the person who has influenced me the most happened a very long time ago. It was a nen, see, One when I was an enlisted sailor influencing the most not by necessarily his job or his great guidance that he gave, but really, the way he carried himself in the way, he, um, took care of business and was consistent in his faith being on a ship that did not have a chaplain. He was the person I looked, too. And he was the person who really planted the seed, uh, to who I am today."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Tell me about a mentor that you have or had. How did that person positively influence your academic decisions?,"So one of my even current mentors now and friend, I would consider friend has really influenced my decisions by allowing me to take on more challenges by him standing up for me. Um, in times of fit reps and awards and then challenging me Thio do better when I maybe wanted to take a job that was just more comfortable or easier to Dio Yeah, he would constantly remind me who I serve and it really challenged me. Thio be a better person and it ultimately made me a better husband. Better father a same time."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Who is a person that you considered as a role model early in your life?,"eso a person I considered as a role model early in my life would probably happen to be my father in law. He served in the Navy 27 years, retired as a senior chief, but always encouraging. Always there for his family. Um, he's at church every single Sunday, um, sitting with his family still to this day and taking care of them even after retirement. Getting another job to help out S O. He is probably one of the people I've looked to as a role model for my entire career."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How and why does this person impact your life?,"um So this person really impacts me, My father in law based on his actions. Still, to this day, I want to be a better man because I see how he serves his family. I see, uh, sometimes even the fact that I see that he's proud of me. So I wanna make him more proud. And so I want to do better things and and create other opportunities. And so just the fact that he is there supporting has served his country, has done things the right way and has sacrificed for his family. Makes me want to be a better person."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How can you tell if someone will be a good mentor?,"I think when you can tell someone's a good mentor is that they're the ones showing interest in you. Without you even knowing it. They're giving you guidance. They're giving you support. Uh, they might see something in you that sparked an interest in them, but it's natural for them. You know that. It's going to be something, uh, longstanding. I think if you are the one that has to constantly contact your mentor, it's probably not gonna last very long."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"If I don't have a mentor, how can I find good one?","Sometimes finding a mentor can be an awkward situation because you're in a place where you don't wanna be rejected. But at the same time, you know, this is something you need. So I think naturally we gravitate towards people, um that are, like us or that are in the same circumstances. Us. And I think pretty easily you can find someone senior to you. They may have shown an interest in you, at least personally. So that would be where I would start closest to me as I went. And if that person is, has a career that you can see you getting into, I think that's the natural start for that."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What is your plan to reach your career/life goal?,"So my plan Thio to meet my life goals and career goals have been pretty consistent for quite some time is that I really try to just for me it's it's service above all. And so I I look at things that I'm not working for necessarily. My commanding officer from my admiral is that I looked at a zit. I'm serving God. And if I want to give my best to God, I'm naturally going to be a great worker. I'm gonna be a great leader, an officer. I'm gonna be a good husband. I'm gonna be a good father. All those things fall in line because my my point of service doesn't end at the command level. It goes way beyond something that only God can control. And so I think because my services to something greater, it means that the sky and the limit is much greater"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What happens when you separate from the military?,"So I think when someone separates from the military really depends on if it was voluntary or involuntary. Those who usually separate separate on a voluntary basis have some sort of preparation, have a plan, have something in line that they were looking to for a very long time, and so that separation is much easier now. They may come to a point where they realize that, um, they're not part of the same club they have been for a very long time. So there is a transition for that. Those who were separated involuntarily have a little bit bigger struggle. Maybe they didn't do the same leg work that the other individual did. So they have. Hopefully. Still, some of the same resource is that they can talk thio even talking to a chapel and to help prepare for that, um, to get to different options that they may have. But it really depends on where they're coming from. And what is their value"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What do you believe will be the most important factors that will shape your future?,"I think having the right training degree or experiences is very important. While you're in the military, it's gonna it's gonna really characterize your service and to what jobs you are qualified for. But more importantly, you know, most of our life has done outside the military. Eventually, one day we do get out and Soto have, ah, competitive degree or experience that will translate out in the civilian world. I think is very crucial. And sometimes those degrees don't match up. For instance, maybe you are wanna be a business person, but in the Navy, you're a swot or you're an aviator. So having a degree, an MBA and business might be something that will put you at the next level out in the civilian world. So I think it just depends on your goals and your situation."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"How important is it to have the right training, degree or experience?","I mean, I think there's a lot of different important factors that shape your future. You know, taking care of yourself, making sure you're hitting the right career milestones, whether that's education or schools. But I think something that people really neglect to do and to look at is to really take care of their family instead of chasing the goal of your career and knowing even if it lasts for 20 years, at one day you're going to sit across the table from the person that you eventually married and those Children that you raised, and to know who they are, I think, is the most important thing that we can dio and the most important investment that we could make."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How do you continue to improve your skills during your career?,"So I think there's many ways that you can do to improve your skills. Um, you should. You should be a forever learner. Everywhere you go, you should always want Thio increase. You should be reading a ZMA each as you possibly can, But there's always opportunities, uh, for extra schooling, whether it's civilian, whether it's military with JPM me or going upto postgraduate school or taking a spot at Monterey Toe. Learn something new. So there's opportunities. I think for everyone enlisted has opportunities for different certifications. You could even get a certification and coaching and being a life coach. And so I think, the limit its limitless out there even as far as taking a civilian school, Um, many times the G I bill will cover those opportunities also."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How often have you been presented with challenging new skills to learn?,"I think each duty station that you go to there is, ah, on opportunities for challenging new skills to learn. Um, I kind of associate me and my role is a chaplain. Is is a missionary and going to a different place. And so I get to that duty station. I have to learn how the people talk. What do they look like? What do they wear? And I assess that situation, and so that's a learning process for me. Before I really dive into getting them, they have to earn my trust. They have to understand, um, them there for the long haul and so that in it by itself is challenging. It's exciting, but it's an opportunity in a process that we have to go through."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How much of your free time do you spend learning new tasks?,"so I always like to be a person of learning. And so learning new tasks is continual. Um, sometimes even learning new tasks is not associate with professionalism. Sometimes you wanna learn how to play an instrument or learn a different language, and I would approve all of those things and think that's all part of being a professional learner, and it's going to increase your skill set and give you other opportunities to perform."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What are you doing daily to ensure your growth and development continues?,"so some of the things that I continue to do daily to make sure that my growth is there is is I'm a reader. I like to read different things. So anywhere from the CNO or the comment of Marine Corps is reading list, which changes every few years, Um, two different tasks that may come up. I make sure that I'm continuously studying, um, scripture. I am a chaplain, and that's part of my job. But also take jobs and tasks that or maybe outside of my purview or something that I have not done before, um, to increase my growth, whether it's writing professional document or just continue to grow physically and with my exercise and the things that I want to accomplish their"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How often do you receive recognition and advancement for contributions?,"so being Ah, more senior officer, um, your opportunities to recognition may not be as much as a more junior person, but I received reckon recognition whenever my whenever my people or the people that I serve, um, get advanced, have great opportunities afforded to them. That's where I really received my recognition. It may not come from directly from the supervisor, but I know that I had a part in that, and that's what makes me feel accomplished."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What are the ribbons/awards that you've gotten?,"So throughout my career, I've been fortunate to receive a lot of different awards. I've received everything from a nem sm to multiple Navy calms, uh, been awarded higher ribbons, that it may have not been given to me because of my position. But there's it was tons of opportunities to get different things and different theaters of activity that I served in. And so, unfortunately, I've never received the the only awards that the enemy can give, which is the Purple Heart and a combat action ribbon. But I'm okay with that."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What is the ratio of men and women on a ship?,"So I think each ship that you go to has a different ratio. Um, just off the top of my head, I would say it's probably still at least you know, 60 70% men and 30% women."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Can you date while on a ship?,"So I think on most ships, dating is is frowned upon by the leaders. Unless it's somebody off the ship that you're seeing now, especially as a leader, it is increases the complications because now you're looked at and there could be, um, appearance off view, treating somebody more favorably because you're dating them or they're a friend of someone you're dating, so it creates another complication upon that."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Describe any instances of sexual impropriety in your workplace and the consequences.,"so I mean, there's many different opportunities for people to get in trouble, and unfortunately out of them has to do with sexual in nature. One example is when I was serving in Afghanistan, my executive officer had an undo relationship with a sergeant that he supervised. And I think people in the unit kind of knew about it and understood, and it made things very uncomfortable. Uh, people were kind of standoffish. Ultimately, the individuals were caught by outside entity, and that individual got relieved to got sent back, and ultimately, his career has was over."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How much does sexual misconduct affect a team compared to other bad behaviors?,"So when we're talking about sexual misconduct compared to other bad behaviors, it really comes down to who does it affect? Ah, sexual misconduct not only can affect the individual that z conducting it and the person who's being abused by it, but it really undermines all the people in that workspace. And sometimes it could even affect, um, their performance and what they're gonna doing. Sometimes other bad behaviors, whether it's a D. U I or an alcohol related incidents on Lee effects an individual where you have aspects of sexual assaults and sexual indicators really can be something that could be spread about, spread around an entire division or department toe, undermine that leadership."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Is sexual harassment common? What kinds?,"I think in today's society, sexual harassment is, unfortunately, a little too common. Um, not that it happened less in the past, but now, because of social media and because of people recording everything, it's it's much more out there. But some of the things that could be on the lookout or for things that may seem in some societies, okay, But they're really not touching someone's bottom, saying Good game or maybe even giving somebody a shoulder rub or being aggressive and asking somebody out more than one occasion, even if they originally said no. I think those sometimes in some societies, like it's OK, but it really is effective effects the individual that it's happening Thio and then undermines everybody else in the command."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What other kinds of harassment do you see?,"so I think that there is many different types of harassment that you see that's beyond sexual harassment. It could be from just someone's lifestyle. Maybe they do not participate in the same things that the rest of the crew do, or the rest of division does, and they might be singled out. Maybe it's It's just something like in high school where this person doesn't like sports and they have other interests over here. They could be harassed for that. Sometimes if they don't want to partake in alcohol or those types of activities that could be harassed. And so the harassment really Onley goes to the imagination of the individual. But sexual harassment is one of them, but not the only."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,When should you step in if you feel like somebody might be getting harrassed? What's a good way to do it?,"So if you observe as a leader somebody else being harassed, I think it needs to be addressed right away. See something? Say something. I believe if you create a culture of that, it's unacceptable at any level. I don't believe you have to necessary. Come off the top rope, but to come alongside and point out what is wrong, what your expectations are and that it's not gonna be accepted. That would probably curtail much of the future potential sexual harassment, at least in your division."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"What situations have a higher risk for harassment or sexual assault? (e.g., duty cycles, locations, events)","so I think maybe places or locations that may have a higher risk of sexual assault or maybe isolated, um, places there are. There are certain duty stations where maybe families, um, are are unwelcome on the command, whether it's for reasons of space or it's an individual augment e um, things along those nature long separation. Those are all I think, Foster mawr opportunity for sexual assault or harassment."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What kinds of behaviors do you ban that are sometimes allowed in the Navy?,"so my belief is that just because it's allowed in the Navy or legal doesn't mean it's productive or good. So some of the things, especially in in regards like sexual harassment, that I would not allow our maybe a risky or risque photos or calendars, Um, that may maybe pinpoint a certain gender or put him in a certain certain way. I also don't allow certain type of talk that happen, especially if you're talking about somebody else's, uh, spouse or friend, or things along those Navy that not necessarily illegal but definitely detrimental to good order and discipline."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How do I deal with generational differences in views of appropriate boundaries?,"So as you look at generations or different cultures or communities, each one has a set of standards that they would see is appropriate. I think the best thing that we can do is is learn about those and understand, um, to know, maybe someone who's ah little bit older has been a Navy for a long time, maybe more comfortable with doing, um, some things that were done in the past where someone new maybe very sensitive to sexual harassment, because they've grown up in a culture and environment where, UM, it's not acceptable and it's not allowed. And so that's something that we need to look at culturally, Um, some cultures find it okay to be in somebody else's space when they're conversing, and maybe they use their hands when they talk. Or they do a lot of touching and to understand some intent, but ultimately know that the person who is being affected is the one, and that's the limitations that we need to honor"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"How do you motivate sailors to act appropriately, if they think their behavior is harmless?","I think education, um, is the first step to motivating your sailors to understand that just because you have this perception doesn't mean that everybody else has a perception and so putting them into that individual shoes. Sometimes they realize what their actions air doing. And even if they don't realize to understand that there are rules and whether the expectations and it's not what you think is the problem is what the victim thinks is the problem."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,When shouldn't you deal with a misconduct issue at the lowest level?,"so I don't think you should deal with the misconduct issue at the lowest level when we're talking about items that are going to either hurt the individual, hurt others or have, ah, wide, um, swath of effect on a division or the department. You know, one of the resource is you can actually go to if it's more difficult to give up the chain of command is to talk to your chaplain. And ironically, I cannot divulge that information as a chaplain because of the confidentiality that which I hold. But there are opportunities for me to help the situation and find resource is and and things that will help defuse the situation and get to the results that are needed."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"When you are in charge, what are the boundaries that you set for sailors? (e.g., touching, sharing rooms offbase)","So when I'm in charge, I play things a little bit more on the conservative side. And when we're traveling with groups that if it's just a male and a female, we try to avoid having that try to keep rooms to same sex, um, individuals. When we're sharing different spaces assed, far as that's concerned, uh, even I myself, if I have to travel with a female is awkward. Is it? It is I I may even sit in the back seat because I love my wife and I love my family, and I don't want anybody to have any perception of me being out of line."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,When is a formal report necessary for a harassment or sexual assault claim?,"so a formal report is is completely up to the individual who has received the harassment or the assault sexually. Um, there's no right answer because, um, some individuals I don't want to go forward with the information, but it's always appropriate to go talk. Thio. At least talk to a chaplain toe. Understand your resource is and to know that there's confidence in your communications and then whether you submit a formal report, restricted or unrestricted report, this is safe place to go."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Are you happy with your job?,"so being happy in a job, I think it is a trick question, and I think happiness comes and goes sometimes even daily. But I get joy within my job. Joy is, I think, a word that we can use that it's a satisfaction. It's something that is, uh is beyond happiness. Happiness comes and goes with tragedy. Sometimes we get sad, but my joy never departs."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How can your work change the world?,"so specifically my work and changing the world. Think takes on a new meeting, since I I stand between the living and the dead and I have an opportunity to really affect what I would say is people's Eternity. Three opportunity for me to come alongside somebody and share God's love is crucial. I think it's the most important thing, whether we win wars or lose wars or deal with pandemics or whatever situations happen. Marriages, families, Um, you put whatever in that blank. I think eternity is is the greatest is forever. And so I get in opportunity to lead people to God and to sometimes model who God is. And so for me, I think that's how I'm changing the world."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What is the most important lesson about life you have learned?,"I think one of the most important lessons about life is is to stop and just be. So look around at the circumstances that God has given you, whether it's at a duty station at, ah, place that you would never have visited before. If you're a civilian, whether even if Zahhar decor Ah, problem that you're having with your family. But to savor every moment that you have in life because life is a vapor and before you know it, you're going to be at the end of your career. You're gonna be at the end of whatever you're trying to dio, and you're gonna look back and for what? And so to sit back and enjoy what you're going through at that moment."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What makes you proud?,"So what makes me proud is when I look at things that I have influenced, whether it's my Children, whether it's sailors or Marines or people that have come in contact with me. And maybe I've mentor them. Maybe even I just gave them advice at a conference or at a training, and I watch them take that advice and run with it and succeed. That makes me proud that they were able to have courage, toe, listen, courage to move forward and experience it, and then they get to reap the benefit of the wisdom."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How and where do you find inspiration?,"So I find my inspiration from my family from my wife, who stays at home and takes care of the kids and is very It's rewarding in itself. But people look at it as selfless and her just crushing life every single day, doing great things and pouring herself into our Children. Um, that inspires me every single day. I think about that."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What keeps you up at night?,"so very few things keep me up at night. Um, I try to leave my work at work, and so I think the one thing I could never leave is my family. So when I think about my family and if if they're struggling with something, my Children who just need guidance, that's what keeps me up at night."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Not a take?,"it was kind of, well, if you if you ask if you ask a leader what keeps him up at night, it's never positive. It's always if you ever ask your commander because that za question I'd like to ask what keeps you up at night so you could mitigate that, And it's It's almost ever always worrying about his crew worrying about."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What has been your greatest success?,"I would look at my greatest successes, not any military accomplishment or any academic endeavor that I've done is. But my greatest successes is my family. Um, my family is intact. After 25 years, I have for lovely Children who I believe still love me, that I maintain contact with on a regular basis. And so I think in society, especially today, that is my legacy. That's what's gonna have long lasting no matter what I do here in the military. So I would say my greatest successes, my family."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How do you define success?,"So how I define success might be a little bit different. It's the same thing. I tell, uh, my sailors that I would tell my Children successes, independence. It's being un dependent on anybody else being at a place or you're happy your content you don't need Outside resource is so whether that is and enlisted sailor on content with their job or whether it's an admiral. Successes, independence more than just monetary but spiritually, physically, mentally, its independence."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What is the difference between a restricted vs. unrestricted report of assault?,"so different types of assault. There are different reporting factor is a restricted and unrestricted. Both have, um, different circumstances. So restricted, uh, report is one report that you would submit that nobody knows Thea events that took place. I'm not sure if it's just the commanding officer, you may be aware, but what it does do is it allows all of the evidence to be collected all the different specimens unfortunate nous happened, but to not be reported upon a chain of command, The unrestricted is you report it, they collect all the evidence and it goes up the chain of command not necessarily your immediate chain of command, but for the people who can address the sexual assault Now, if you report to a chaplain, it doesn't matter if it's restricted or unrestricted, because they have confidence and they will not report it for either way. So it's a safe haven there. I will say that if you report to certain individuals like if you report to ah hospital out in town, you no longer can have a restricted because they're bound by different laws than in the military. So there is a little bit of nuance and complications, but in essence is who sees the reports knowing that you go and get help. Either way is what's important."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"In terms of inappropriate sexual behavior, when should you handle it yourself versus get an expert?","I think if you see or hear about any kind of sexual assault or harassment, I think it it comes down to the rule here something or see something. You do something. I think you need to go to the individual first at the lowest level possible. And from there you take it up chain of command, that they do not report it. If they do not address it, then you take it up the chain of command. Now, if it's the victim, it is there right to report or UN report whether they want to do a formal investigation there, that's up to them. But I think you need to immediately. If it's gonna hurt outside of people, I would again, another great resource to go to is the chaplain because of the confidentiality, and that person should be able to help you pinpoint who to talk to, who not to talk to. What are the rules? What are the regulations and the re sources that are available"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"What should you do if someone has been assaulted or harassed, but leadership isn't following up?","So if there's been a sexual assault reported and leadership does not seem to reacting, every victim will be assigned an advocate for them. And I think that advocate is works outside the chain of command, even though they may be within that command and Kenbrell it to a different individual that potentially is not within the chain of command. To help see this thing moved through the right channels and get addressed appropriately."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"What are some ways you can encourage a team support a possible victim of assault, rather than become defensive or hostile in the team?","I think one of the ways you can really support your your team member, whether there are the victim or the accused, is to understand that, you know, there is there is a system in place. Um, you are guilty and you are innocent until proven guilty that there are three sides to every story, kind of the victims, the assailants and then probably the truth sometimes. And so I think, to treat people fairly regardless of either situation, they are and to be professional eyes, the best way to go along. Make sure that the support is given to both parties because both of them are going through a traumatic situation."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"What are the roles of different resources to respond to sexual assault? (e.g., chaplain, sapro)","yes, So each person in the chain of command or at a command has different roles. When dealing with the sexual assault you have your victim advocate is there primarily for the victim. Um, they're they're going to see everything from their point of view. You have a chaplain who has is a unequal footing, has has an opportunity. Thio listen to advise based on 100% confidentiality. There's no risk of it going up the chain of command or to anybody else, because the confidence really lies in the person telling you, have your command who has to who is responsible for making sure that the victim and the accused is taking care of fairly and that there is a process put in place and then you have outside Fleet and family who have array of resource is that can support both individuals with counseling with advocacy and different avenues to that. So there's really is limit list, but each of them have different roles and what they can and cannot report. But the understanding those is important"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What are signs you should look out for that might mean there is discrimination after a disagreement/harassment?,"I think some signs that need to be looked out for in regards to discrimination is if if one individual, whether it's the victim or the accused is, may be placed in a situation that was outside of what they were doing before, for instance, they get reassigned to something that would be considered a more negative job or they're the one being punished because all their friends now have moved to the other person. And so those are some things that need to be constantly reminded and observed during the whole process to make sure it's fair and equal and that it gets a fair look during the investigation."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What do you do to avoid bias when evaluating sailors?,"You know, one way Thio avoid bias when evaluating sailors is is looking at their record for what it is. What I mean by that is, um, many times when you're even doing evils and or if you're a board member looking at evils, you don't see a picture. You don't see an individual race, creed, religion. You see their accomplishments and what they've done. And so if you can train yourself is as you're evaluating, despite if that person has the same interests as you or come from the same background as you as you. If you were to evaluate on their Onley on their accomplishments and their potential, I think then you can avoid some biases in the future."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How to help ensure everyone has a voice rather than a majority clique dominating/shutting out other perspectives?,"I think one way to make sure that everybody has a voice is as a leader specifically is to have an open door policy and to really mean it. Um Toe have make opportunities to speak to everyone, maybe even in private, so that they don't feel embarrassed sharing what it is. Um, that's one way to do it. Some. I've seen some places where they have put in suggestion boxes. They're locked up and they actually go through those suggestion boxes and talk about it, and it just creates an environment of collaboration. And then also, when is a good idea that's utilized or something that's been taken from one of those suggestions to give that person the credit and making sure that their everybody knows that they're the result of that good thing happening."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How should you respond to a death on the ship?,"so as a leader respond to in death on a ship, you have to understand that everybody deals with it differently. This might be the first time that they knew an individual who died. This could be something that is very familiar to them, so to understand and to give opportunities for people to mourn differently and to not place your own preconceptions on how they should mourn on them, I think is key. Giving them resource is giving them time, if appropriate, and then trying to get back to normal as soon as you can help heal those situations."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How should you respond to a suicide on the ship?,"So I think responding to a suicide comes with a few different complications because of cultural, um, and theological beliefs on what suicide means. Everybody has a different perception, but I think people still go through the grief. Still go through a lot of questioning. Um, the one caveat you may have with suicide is individuals asking, What if I have Dunmore? What if I was stepped in or saw the signs? So you may have to deal with some secondary and third order effects of your sailors as they cope with this. And then you have to deal with individuals who may be joke about the suicide or, um, say that the place is better off without him. They didn't want him there anyways, so you have to deal with those types of reactions which are valid reactions and and very normal. But to understand that and have the resource is available"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Why is it a common reaction to say you're better off without someone who committed suicide?,"So I think people react differently to suicide. And when a reaction is good riddance or I'm glad they did, it is many times is they're uncomfortable with death themselves. Or maybe they've had a loved one or somebody else that they know who had died by suicide. And so it's really a reaction to get past it and not have to deal with it. So allowing them toe have their thoughts and and cope with it and their situation, and maybe some education might get them along and see the rial seriousness of it."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What resources are most effective to help sailors deal with grief or loss?,"So when dealing with suicide or loss, there's resource is really depend on individual. But some resource is that worked. Is bringing an extra counselors chaplains making them available just so people can share their own thoughts and experiences with those individuals? Sometimes it's it's bringing those individuals together as a group and having a group discussion and and in a healthy way describe how it makes them feel, how they are dealing with the circumstance. But really the best resource for any kind of tragedy or death is time and to allow people to hell at their own pace and to not put judgment upon them. Um, depending on how fast or how slow they take."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What is a good way to lead a group discussion after a death? How would you approach that?,"so leading a group discussion after death really depends on how close the individuals were, um, to the situation. Sometimes it might be just opening up the floor and allowing them to share their feelings, uh, to not let it get off track. And but still, to make it opportunity to be therapeutic for them, Thio really understand. Maybe, uh, misspell some of the common misconceptions, um, with suicide or whichever way that they death died? Um, those air those strategies that can be used, But it's really mawr of opening up a forum, making it a safe place to talk and allowing people to really share their own experiences."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How should you handle a sailor who is less effective at their duties due to grief?,"so sailors who are failing Thio to do their their task because of grief, sometimes just kind of need a quote unquote reset. Maybe this is an opportunity for them to take some vacation takes. Um, leave. Maybe there is a place that you can move them to distract them from their job. But be careful, because sometimes when you take people out of a familiar environment, it makes things worse. It makes them feel like they're being punished. Um, too so really be open to different suggestions from them. But to understand that that you are there to support them, that you are there and able to provide resource is for them, but they could give them that space that they need."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How should you respond to someone who has thoughts of suicide?,"so having thoughts of suicide is very common. It's its's ridiculous almost to tell somebody to stop thinking about suicide. Um, but some of the ways that you can do is is to make sure that you're talking to individual. And so, um, if you were taking a trip to Australia and didn't have ah passport or a plane ticket, I would probably think that you're not serious. And just like, if you're talking about suicide and you really don't know, um, you need to listen to that person and think. But if they have a plan in place and they have a place, that they're gonna do this, it's a very serious thing that you need to address, but really just taking everything seriously, taking everything as it's important to that individual not downplaying any of their experiences or any any of their loss that they had that's making them feel this way. Making sure that they have the resource is that they need that they have an individual that they can contact at any point of the day, whether that's yourself, whether that's a family member or a friend, whether that's a chaplain or ah, social worker. But having numbers that they can contact whenever they're on their lowest point, contemplating suicide is going to be key"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What is a good way to get a plan in place to try to ensure that a suicidal person always has someone they're comfortable with calling at any hour of the day?,"so putting in a plan in place for someone who's contemplating suicide. Um, in the past, they would. There was contracts that were being made between the individual who was contemplating suicide and the person that was necessary counseling with him. But really, what it comes down to is is having more than one resource for them. Um, there is always a national suicide hotline, and depending on the location you're at or a regional area, that could be 1 24 hour number that they could call. Um, the chain of command should be one, and I would always recommend a friend or somebody close to them. A family member should be on that list, but making sure that's just not one number that they have or one resource. And to have two or three, maybe if it's if it's on a corridor. If I were counseling that individual toe, maybe I take their phone and ask them for their phone and and place my number in there specifically, eso. I know that they have that resource, and then if they can't get a hold of me to give them an alternate place, I think that's key because many times. It's just the person to talk Thio an individual to connect with that's gonna help them cope with that."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Have you known someone who died in the Navy? (or seriously injured?),"So throughout my career, especially my deployments over to Afghanistan, I have, unfortunately been, um, on the front lines and my first tour with the Marines. I probably had to deal with hundreds of individuals being sent back on C one thirties transfer ceremonies where we put bodies on plane and send, um, to Dover to a family member, Um, and then again, with special forces at a much smaller scale but still personal, Ah, personal experience, where individuals that I knew are served with died and gave the ultimate sacrifice."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How you known someone who committed suicide in the Navy?,"so being being a chaplain, we are an individual who, unfortunately, it has to do death notifications. And throughout my career is a chaplain. I've I've dealt with multiple suicides, um, somewhere people that maybe run into on occasion or maybe even spoke to once or twice and somewhere, maybe just members of the command that I didn't know or a sister command that I had to be involved with. One time an individual who was having suicidal ideations tried to call me, um, to talk. But I was in a location where I did not get reception and the individual ended up taking his life death by suicide, Not necessarily because they couldn't get ahold of me because there was this other issues. But it's still affected me greatly and the importance of having backups, the people you could talk to"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"What risk factors should you look out for, to identify a real suicide risk from person having a bad day or rough patch?","So in the Navy and even in the civilian world, there's a list of kind of suicidal risks that you would see someone particular participate in. That may be a trigger or something to observe, but the common denominator for all suicide or death by suicides is loss, and that could be loss of a relationship. Could be loss of status. Money rank could be lost of ah, pet could be loss of freedom. Um, but really looking at those things and taking it serious when you start seeing those symptoms, whether they're giving things away, whether they're different than they were before, Just because somebody is happy or acting happy doesn't mean they're not suicidal. In fact, sometimes people act happy when they have a plan to end their life because they feel like it's almost over. So there is some very common misconceptions about that. But looking for lost an individual's life is a trigger that I would do as a professional Azam counseling somebody and talking to them and then being forthright and asking them saying something along the lines of Hey, you know, people who have this circumstance that happened to him. Whatever it is, sometimes they think about killing themselves, that something you've thought about and bringing it to the point and you may get a response of No, that's not anything that I'm thinking about or you're crazy or, you know, thank you for asking. I have had thoughts which will then open up a dialogue, that we can have a real conversation."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What's a good way to ask someone if they are suicidal?,"So if you're ever in a situation where you feel that a person is suicidal or potentially could be the only way, and the best way to really do it is to ask outright, you may feel awkward at first and say, Do you want to kill yourself? But there are ways to go about and saying, You know people in your circumstance, whether it's people who have just recently divorced or people who have lost their jobs sometimes they consider, uh, killing themselves. Is that something you've thought about but really stating the fact? Because if you say, Do you feel like doing something stupid or harming yourself? It's kind of beating around the bush and doesn't really get to the answer. It really what it does is we want to give them permission to talk about it."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How can you help encourage people with suicidal thoughts to talk about it with others?,"So when, when dealing with people who are suicidal or having those thoughts, and after counseling with them and speaking with them, it's always one of my first goals is toe is to connect them with somebody that they trust. This could be an uncle could be a family member. It could be a friend and to be kind of ah, a warm handoff individual and yeah, allowing them to know that their confidence is safe with me. But it's their choice to go outside of our circle to talk about that. I would never go outside of anyone's circle unless they gave permission, but to really encourage them because that individual is going to be with them for for a little long haul. I maybe only station there for a year, a year and a half or three years at the most. But that individual that they choose, whether it's a family member or friend, is going to be with them for the rest of her life."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What should you do if someone might be a suicide risk and you know they have easy access to guns or other weapons?,"so as a ZA leader. And I know of somebody who's at a high suicide risk and has access to weapons is unfortunately, if it's your own personal weapons, I'm gonna ask them permission to restore them on. I'm not gonna It's not gonna be not attribute. Ally. Don't have toe not gonna be punished. But just while they're doing with their circumstances, if if they have a friend or even a family member, that can keep those weapons from them. And sometimes it's not guns. Sometimes it's it's medication or other things. And so to be able to remove that temptation from that individual is critical. Now, if it's a duty status thing and that individual is on suicide watch, they will not be in a position to carry a weapon on this ship or to be in a place to damage themselves. So we have to take those considerations and always underpinning it with that. They're not being punished, that we're doing it because we care for them and we want them to get past that. And once they're past that to bail to reinstate those privileges"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"If you take away a gun or something they planned to kill themselves with, will they just find another way to do it?","So if you take away a gun from someone who was planning on killing themselves, um they will most likely find another avenue thio the harm themselves. But it may be a lot more difficult. Eso we see different Even within genders, there are different ways of killing themselves. Where you see ah man is more likely. Thio use a handgun or something much more violent where a woman may do something along lines of ingesting too many pills, toe overdose or something along those lines. So but it does help. It does. It does keep them, maybe one step away from it. But ultimately we want to keep them in a safe environment across the board. We want to continue to have contact with the individual until they're out of the clear."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,Do most people who attempt suicide try again?,"I think statistically that most people who attempt suicide will do it more than once, Um, that there's a There's kind of a threshold for a lot of people who think about it but would never dare to attempt it, whether it's cultural or they don't want to go through it. But those that attempt, I believe, have a much more propensity to do it again."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,When should you get Navy resources involved with a risk of suicide?,"so as a leader were talking outside of a chaplain. Once the individual is gonna harm themselves or somebody else, uh, from a chaplain's perspective, we don't tell them ever unless that person comes to us and asks us to share, um, what their intent is. And so we have to find a way to craft a KNOPPER. Tune it for them to get outside help, or somebody outside of the chain of command that is not a chaplain."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,When is a formal report necessary for a possible suicide risk?,"so there's no real formal report, Um, when someone is considering suicide, necessarily if that individual were to go to ah medical individual Corman or a dock on this ship or at your command, that would generate potentially a report or if there was an attempt that would generate a report on the medical side which the command may somehow find out."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What skills have you built over time to help deal with death?,"so as a chaplain like any other, um, designator in the Navy, your job. You have training that deals with what you do, and unfortunately, we do deal with death on a somewhat regular basis. So there are some formal trainings that we go through, whether it's through our seminary, whether it's Keiko training, which is casualty assist, uh, officer training, whether it's going to the mortuary affairs training that we have, or just plain experience dealing with it on a regular basis. All those kind of play a factor on how each individual chaplain deals with death, how they do notifications, how to deal with it personally within your own self. And then you also have to throw in the mix of their faith, background and what death means in their faith, background and the circumstances surrounding"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What are some good tips for dealing with grief?,"I think one of the biggest tips that you can have a deal with grief is sometimes people use is a cop out answer. But really, the only thing that really deals with grief is time separation. And when I when I'm speaking with individual who's who's angry, first of all, ah, much quieter and I'm allowing them to really, um, lead the conversation. But then to tell them and allow them to understand that it's not always going to feel this way. And for anybody who's experienced death, they don't feel ast. Time goes by, they think about it less and less, and it becomes less, uh and therefore front of their mind. And so I would say the best thing and best advice is, uh, time could only heal it. It does stink, and it is hard and is difficult, and you don't you don't place parameters around what they're going through. But to understand that time will heal"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,How do I help my sailors deal with grief if I am also grieving/upset?,"so if you're dealing with grief yourself and trying to help your sailors also deal with it, I think, um, making sure that you're taking care of ultimately with your resource is and the avenues that you're going through but to also be transparent with your sailors. And to understand that this is a tough time for not just you but for everybody and to allow them to grieve with you. And I think as a community or as a division, or is a ship or a command, or whoever is experiencing that the leaders, if they're transparent, that will give the people that are following the sailors underneath them toe also be transparent to heel and toe to benefit from one another."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,"Are there specific strategies to deal with grief at a time when you can't take a breather (e.g., active engagement/conflict)?","so dealing with grief is always the optimal thing is to do it right then and there. But sometimes operations, whether you're deployed and there's maybe a mission the next day and it's not quite feasible. So, um, it's real difficult, but to try to find in the individual time for that person to have access to resource is one of the things that we did as chaplains is we were able to embed with the teams and all of a sudden, now you have an instant councilor. There s so many times they would go out on ops and deal with some traumatic issues, sometimes loss. And I was there when they came back and I was there. It was somebody familiar that they could talk Thio. It didn't fix the situation, But then to make sure that once we return that we could spend some real time as as a unit, And the danger is that when you return from combat, everybody separates and and goes their own way. But it's really key and important that individuals get that time to decompress together and to share stories and to share experiences to make sure that they're kind of resetting before they take off and go to the next mission."
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What options do you have to work with a sailor who is sick frequently or for longer periods?,"So when, when dealing with individuals who might be what we would call out of the fight because of sickness and and if you're a leader or coworker there, there are many different options. I mean, everybody in their life goes through some scenarios where they may not be an optimal health or maybe in a tough situation, even if it's not them. And so to understand that and Thio maybe educate those around you and so to take care of the individual, making sure that they're getting what's needed. Because the reality is if we rush people back too soon and they're not ready to come back, they're just gonna they're gonna get back out of the fight. But if we could get up and round and and ready to go and and purely taking care of everything that they need to, they're gonna be another asset to the team. And then when they come back, maybe there's opportunities to give all those individuals who had to step up and maybe take some extra workload. Maybe they get a little bit of time off and an opportunity to kind of regroup themselves"
,,hammen-eric-cdr,What can you do to help sailors who have a task that is very hard and they did not expect or get trained for?,"so many times in the military, you get put in places that you weren't trained for, and that's a very difficult one. That comes to mind. Was my first tour to Afghanistan. There was a group of Marines who were the reservists from the middle of America. They were assigned as generated mechanics and different jobs and and they got placed in a unit that was was responsible for collecting. Uh, they're dead comrades their body parts and then do inventories and place them on a plane back to Dover to their family members. Ah, very difficult thing that they were not expecting to do. They did not have the training for but to understand that they were part of something much bigger, something that was going to be, uh, fruitful for the whole unit, fruitful for the families. And ultimately, when they left, uh, such a memory of of service that they got to accomplish while they were in country"
