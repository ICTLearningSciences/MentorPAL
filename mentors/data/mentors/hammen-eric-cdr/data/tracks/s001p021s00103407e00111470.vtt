00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.910
I think some very general advice that I've been given, even from my detailers,

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.980
 there are no bad assignments. The bloom where you're planted

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.040
 It sounds kind of hokey and kind of like an excuse. But if you really

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.100
 think about it, um, you could make a difference Anywhere you go,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.160
 whether it's for me, it's in a chapel stateside where it's not too

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.230
 exciting. It's a bunch of retirees or whether you're at the tip of the

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.290
 spear with the Marines and the Navy seals. Both sets of people need

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.350
 you. Both have other rewards. Um, for you if you do well and I just

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.420
 think it shows consistency to the leadership and it shows that you're

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.480
 a team player.
