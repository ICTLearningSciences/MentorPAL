00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.890
I think all of your relationships, when it comes to work, needed to be

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.920
 on a professional level. It doesn't mean that there is not a family

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.960
 aspect of your circumstances. I think you can know intimate details

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.990
 about them, but I think there needs to be a line driven when you talk

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.030
 about what is what are we trying to accomplish today? And if our

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.070
 relationship is too relaxed, is that going to affect the mission at

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.100
 task? Or is it too stringent where you're afraid to come talk to me

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.140
 and share some details That might be, uh, important in our aspect, So

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.170
 I think there needs to be a blend and it comes back down to consistency

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.210
 and how we do business.
