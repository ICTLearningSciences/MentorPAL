I think something you really need to know about your team members are

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.850
 there, right and left lateral limits. Um, what is there? Ah, capacity,

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.850
 um, to do a task. Um, what is their experiences in the past with

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.850
 conducting these things? Because there is, ah, fine line of of pushing

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.840
 them to a place where they grow as leaders themselves, but then pushing

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.840
 them too far where their they get so disinterested or frustrated

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.840
 with the process that they quit or give up before they get a chance

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.840
 to lead.
