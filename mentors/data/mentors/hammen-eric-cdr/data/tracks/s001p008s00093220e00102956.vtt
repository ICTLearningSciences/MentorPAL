00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.950
chaplains air different. One key reason of the differences are confidentiality.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.050
 If you speak to a doctor, which is important, or social worker

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.140
 or human resource is, or even those hired by fleet and family,

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.240
 um, you don't have that confidentiality. And so the commanding officer

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.340
 understands this and employs this. It's a federal mandate that when

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.440
 an individual comes and speaks to us, it's not my confidence. It's

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.540
 the person who's speaking me confidence, so I don't have the permission

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.630
 to share that. And I think that's important because it gives that

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.730
 one person that individual can really share literally anything in

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.830
 their life, whether it's a crime committed, whether it's a crime,

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.930
 that they're thinking about committed or something horrible in their

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.020
 life, that they don't want to get out. And so I think that's the one

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.120
 thing that a chaplain offers. Besides the spiritual aspect of the

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.220
 conversation that nobody else can have in the military
