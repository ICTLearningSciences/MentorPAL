Afghanistan is like what you would see in a movie, but there are different

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.640
 regions. The first time I was there in the Helmand province was

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.030
 very desert, not a lot of greenery. Very, very warm and hot, very much

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:22.430
 like you would see on TV and second time in the in the southeast

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.820
 part of Afghanistan, near Pakistan. There was a lot of very lush and

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.220
 green areas, some mountains that you would not expect to be there,

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.610
 and it actually got rainy at the Times. Um, obviously the cultural,

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.000
 uh, aspect of the individuals that were there, I did not see a lot

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.400
 of adult females. Or in fact, I did not see any adult females in the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.790
 in the year I was there, Um, in the mails that I saw were covered and

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.190
 depending on the villages were either sparsely populated or some

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.580
 of them were pretty large.
