00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.840
I think some of the support that you you have when you when you take a

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.830
 chance and things don't work out, um come from different aspects. One

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.830
 can come from your mentor that is coming alongside you. That is,

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.820
 um, pouring into you, maybe a coach or a supervisor that has interest

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.810
 in your career. But ultimately, you always have your chaplain, and

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.800
 you always have your other counselors on board that have the trust

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.800
 of the command that could come alongside and help kind around some of

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.790
 those edges and pick you up and understand. It's not how you fall

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.780
 but really, how you get back up.
