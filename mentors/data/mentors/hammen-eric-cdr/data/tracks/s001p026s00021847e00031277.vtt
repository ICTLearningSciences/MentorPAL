00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.730
so many times in the military, you get put in places that you weren't

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.610
 trained for, and that's a very difficult one. That comes to mind. Was

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.490
 my first tour to Afghanistan. There was a group of Marines who were

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.360
 the reservists from the middle of America. They were assigned as generated

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.240
 mechanics and different jobs and and they got placed in a unit

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.120
 that was was responsible for collecting. Uh, they're dead comrades

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.000
 their body parts and then do inventories and place them on a plane

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.880
 back to Dover to their family members. Ah, very difficult thing that

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.760
 they were not expecting to do. They did not have the training for

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.640
 but to understand that they were part of something much bigger, something

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.510
 that was going to be, uh, fruitful for the whole unit, fruitful

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.390
 for the families. And ultimately, when they left, uh, such a memory

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.270
 of of service that they got to accomplish while they were in country
