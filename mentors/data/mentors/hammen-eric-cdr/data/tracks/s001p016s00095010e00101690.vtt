I think everybody has self doubt. I think it's it's natural. We're human,

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.510
 we're finite beings. And so sometimes I just have to be reminded.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.340
 And for me, I go to Scripture and it reminds me that I've been fearfully

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.160
 and wonderfully made that God knew me while I was still in the

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.990
 womb and knew the number of hairs on my head. And so for me, I really

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.820
 take it back to that Spirituals promises that God has already given

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.650
 me.
