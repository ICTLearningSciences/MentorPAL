00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.650
So when, when dealing with people who are suicidal or having those thoughts,

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.460
 and after counseling with them and speaking with them, it's always

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.260
 one of my first goals is toe is to connect them with somebody

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.070
 that they trust. This could be an uncle could be a family member. It

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.870
 could be a friend and to be kind of ah, a warm handoff individual and

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.680
 yeah, allowing them to know that their confidence is safe with me.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.480
 But it's their choice to go outside of our circle to talk about that.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.290
 I would never go outside of anyone's circle unless they gave permission,

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.090
 but to really encourage them because that individual is going

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.900
 to be with them for for a little long haul. I maybe only station

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.700
 there for a year, a year and a half or three years at the most. But

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.510
 that individual that they choose, whether it's a family member or friend,

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.310
 is going to be with them for the rest of her life.
