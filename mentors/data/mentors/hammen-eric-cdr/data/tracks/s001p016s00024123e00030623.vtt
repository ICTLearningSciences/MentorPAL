00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.020
some of the failures, which I guess makes me the most unhappy, is the

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.180
 opportunities I had to interact with others. Maybe missed opportunities

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.350
 would be more accurate, uh, chances to really build relationships

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.520
 and to pour into other people's lives where I maybe was distracted

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.680
 based on other circumstances in my own life, which took me away from

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.850
 that chance to really mentor and be with others.
