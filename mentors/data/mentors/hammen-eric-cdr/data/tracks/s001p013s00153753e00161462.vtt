to get to the root of a problem of a team member is. Sometimes it's difficult,

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.090
 but it comes back to as a leader, knowing your people, understanding

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.210
 their weaknesses and sometimes your own transparency and your

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.330
 own opportunities to show where you have failed and have overcome

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.460
 that or have moved past. That will bridge the gap for you to really

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.580
 get alongside a team member who's failing and allowing them thio kind

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.700

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.820
 in our life are not gonna end, um, there and that we have to move

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.940
 forward from it and they could turn out great things.
