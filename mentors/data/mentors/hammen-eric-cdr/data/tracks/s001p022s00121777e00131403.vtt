00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.870
So as you look at generations or different cultures or communities, each

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.890
 one has a set of standards that they would see is appropriate. I

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.910
 think the best thing that we can do is is learn about those and understand,

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.920
 um, to know, maybe someone who's ah little bit older has been

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.940
 a Navy for a long time, maybe more comfortable with doing, um, some

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.960
 things that were done in the past where someone new maybe very sensitive

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.980
 to sexual harassment, because they've grown up in a culture and

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.000
 environment where, UM, it's not acceptable and it's not allowed.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.020
 And so that's something that we need to look at culturally, Um, some

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.040
 cultures find it okay to be in somebody else's space when they're conversing,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.050
 and maybe they use their hands when they talk. Or they do

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.070
 a lot of touching and to understand some intent, but ultimately know

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.090
 that the person who is being affected is the one, and that's the limitations

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.110
 that we need to honor
