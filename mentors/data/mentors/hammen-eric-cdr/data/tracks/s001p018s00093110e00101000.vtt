when you're deployed, it really depends on your location whether alcohol

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.630
 is permitted. Um, if you're going thio Analogy Country over in Europe,

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.520
 when you're on port call, you can drink responsibly. Um, if you

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.410
 are over in the Mideast where it is prohibited there, then you will

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.300
 not be able to drink. They will have non alcoholic beverages there

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.190
 that may taste like beer. Um, there's also certain circumstances. If

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.080
 you're underway for periods of time, they may pull into a location

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.970
 and have some alcohol along with them and put it out on the pier for

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.860
 individuals to have a couple drinks and to have a little downtime.
