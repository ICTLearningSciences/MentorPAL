00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.440
as a kid growing up in the eighties, we didn't have one sport that we

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.020
 play like to do today. We we played every sport that was in season,

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.610
 whether that be baseball, football, the little wrestling. In high school,

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.190
 I was on what we call a ski club, and we did downhill skiing.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.780
 Um, everything thio socially, with my friends going out, probably getting

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.360
 into too much trouble, but pretty much anything that was typical

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.950
 of those in the eighties and nineties.
