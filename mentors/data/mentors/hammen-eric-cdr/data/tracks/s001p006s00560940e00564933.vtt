00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.840
I think leading honorably is something that's more simple than people.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.830
 Um tend to believe. I think if you're if you're true to your beliefs,

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.820
 if you're treating people with respect and with dignity, I think

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.810
 the honorable part is automatic. I think that if you're honest and letting

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.810
 your yes is be your yes, is, it keeps things simple. I think

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.800
 Mark Twain said, If you wanna, uh, not have to remember as much just

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.790
 tell the truth. And so I think that if we can just be consistent in

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.780
 our leadership, that will create an honorable leadership trade.
