00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.220
so sailors who are failing Thio to do their their task because of grief,

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.590
 sometimes just kind of need a quote unquote reset. Maybe this is

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.960
 an opportunity for them to take some vacation takes. Um, leave. Maybe

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.330
 there is a place that you can move them to distract them from their

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.690
 job. But be careful, because sometimes when you take people out of

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.060
 a familiar environment, it makes things worse. It makes them feel like

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.430
 they're being punished. Um, too so really be open to different suggestions

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.800
 from them. But to understand that that you are there to support

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.170
 them, that you are there and able to provide resource is for

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.540
 them, but they could give them that space that they need.
