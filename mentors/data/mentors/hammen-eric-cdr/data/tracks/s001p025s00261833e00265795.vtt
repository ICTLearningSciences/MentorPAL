00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.810
so if you're dealing with grief yourself and trying to help your sailors

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.770
 also deal with it, I think, um, making sure that you're taking care

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.740
 of ultimately with your resource is and the avenues that you're going

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.700
 through but to also be transparent with your sailors. And to understand

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.660
 that this is a tough time for not just you but for everybody

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.620
 and to allow them to grieve with you. And I think as a community or

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.580
 as a division, or is a ship or a command, or whoever is experiencing

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.550
 that the leaders, if they're transparent, that will give the people

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.510
 that are following the sailors underneath them toe also be transparent

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.470
 to heel and toe to benefit from one another.
