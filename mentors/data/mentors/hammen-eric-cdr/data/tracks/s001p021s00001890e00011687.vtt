00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.310
So currently I serve as a chaplain and chaplains come in as a lieutenant

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.770
 J. G because of their vast graduate school time that they've spent,

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.230
 uh, there from there, it's a pretty typical path like it would be

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.690
 for any other officer. You know, 4 to 6, you get one year as a G 4

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.150
 to 6 years as lieutenant. That's about a 70% advancement rate to lieutenant

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.610
 commander, another four or five years as lieutenant commander

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.060
 and another 40 to 50% is a commander and then another 3 to 5 years

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.520
 as a commander, Thio captain. And so the potential is there, Um, it

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.980
 depends on the individual and the opportunities that they have taken

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.440
 while they were in. But it's it's something that is it's a fair process.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.900
 I have seen it myself, a za recorder on the board and you get

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.360
 excited and it seems like it's a good opportunity for individuals to

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.820
 advance
