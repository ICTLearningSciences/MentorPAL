I think one strategy you can use if you're having trouble with listening

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.400
 well is to force yourself to allow that person toe finish there frame

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.680
 of thought and then rephrase it back to them. And to make sure

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.950
 that you have the same intent many times, you'll rephrase something

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.230
 back to them. That was not what they actually said, and they'll have

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.510
 an opportunity to to re re speak it to you. And so then you can again

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.780
 practice that rephrasing until it gets clear in the intent is there.
