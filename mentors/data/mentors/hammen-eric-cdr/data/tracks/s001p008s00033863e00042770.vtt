Sometimes people ask me, How do you love your enemies? Um, in the military

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.770
 and for me as a chaplain and within my faith is there is there's

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.230
 differences between you know, first, for instance, there's a being

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.690
 murder and and killing. Um, and so loving one's enemies is something

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.150
 that's second nature to us because, well, the god that I serve told

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.620
 us to love our enemies, that its's easy for us to love those like

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.080
 us. It's easy for us to love those who think like us and our look like

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.540
 us. But it's a challenge, and it is beneficial to love those who

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.000
 despise us. And I think it's a key role, and it helps us as leaders.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.460
 And it helps us, uh, specifically as chaplains as we go about our day.
