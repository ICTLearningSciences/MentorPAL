00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.200
you know, one way toe, I think toe work smarter is toe toe Look at history.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.550
 And to look at what's been done before you, you re creating something

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.900
 that's already been effective. Are you or are you doing something

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.250
 that really hasn't worked? And you're just turning your wheels.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.600
 So I think as you observe as you study the history of whatever circumstance

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.950
 you're in, that's an opportunity to find out what's actually

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.300
 gonna work, what's not gonna work and how to approach the task.
