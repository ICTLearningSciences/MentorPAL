00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.360
I think tones for leaders are set many different circumstances, and I

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.870
 think it depends on the situation. Um, I do not believe that someone

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.380
 should come in, um, too lax, because that provides a potential danger

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.890
 later on, because people are going to take advantage of that leader.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.410
 But at the same time, I do not think that they should come necessarily

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.920
 off the top rope from the beginning. So I think, a firm, fair

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.430
 approach setting a tone. And then there's always opportunity to relax

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.940
 that tone and set, as as they move forward into a leadership style

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.450
 and as they move forward in the leadership timing.
