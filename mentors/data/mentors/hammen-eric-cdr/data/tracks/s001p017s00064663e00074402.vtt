WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.680
when selecting a new duty station. I do always involve my wife and at

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.500
 some level, my Children. I look at to see what is would be a good fit,

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.330
 whether it's to stay to homestead and stay in the local area because

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.150
 of the familiarity or an opportunity for your career. Is it gonna

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.980
 balance, um, your career out where it's going to give you an opportunity

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.810
 to promote and at the same time be a good place for your family?

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.630
 So the strategy I use is I look at what we call an Alfa roster,

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.460
 which shows where everybody is at. Look at the window in which I am

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.280
 to deploy and maybe right down 5 to 10 different jobs that would be

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.110
 interesting and be beneficial for my family. And then I take time to

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.940
 really pray about it and to maybe do a little research about it. And

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.760
 so when I'm talking to my detailer or the monitor, whichever decides

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.590
 your fate, I have an accurate assessment of where I would like to

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.410
 go. What would be beneficial for both my career and for my family?
