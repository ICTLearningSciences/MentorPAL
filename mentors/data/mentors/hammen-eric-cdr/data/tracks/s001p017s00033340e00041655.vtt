the free time that you have in your career really depends on where you're

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.480
 at. In which location? What your bill it is. So sometimes when I

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.800
 was on shore duty and had a little bit more consistency, my free time

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.110
 was in the evenings and on the weekends, but on station, on a ship

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.430
 or with operational unit, the free time. Maybe it was on a Monday

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.740
 when days were slow, or I left a little bit earlier because we're getting

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.060
 ready to deploy for, um, for the for a deployment. It just really

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.370
 depends on where I was at. But it's pretty consistent, and it's

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.690
 pretty liberal. Um, when I given the opportunity so pretty good, normal

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.000
 amount of free time that you would guess.
