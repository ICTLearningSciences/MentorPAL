You know, we have, ah, lot of different risks that are presented to us,

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.450
 and some of those are authenticity of who we are. One example. I heard

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.250
 from a chaplain who was at a Liberty port. And in order for you

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.060
 to go off the quarterdeck, you had to actually take a condom with you.

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.860
 Obviously, they were having problems on this ship with certain diseases

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.660
 and different issues. And so this chaplain, being a married

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.460
 man, thought that was a inappropriate for him to take a condom. But

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.260
 yet he understood the rules. So at this point, he took the condom and

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.060
 he went on liberty and he came back. But he made a point to take the

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.870
 condom and put it back in the bowl to prove to him the rest of the

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.670
 people that he still had integrity, that he still honor that he was

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.470
 still bound by the law. But it wasn't gonna affect his beliefs for

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.270
 his thought process.
