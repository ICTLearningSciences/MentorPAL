I think some signs that need to be looked out for in regards to discrimination

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.030
 is if if one individual, whether it's the victim or the accused

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.130
 is, may be placed in a situation that was outside of what they

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.220
 were doing before, for instance, they get reassigned to something that

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.310
 would be considered a more negative job or they're the one being

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.400
 punished because all their friends now have moved to the other person.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.500
 And so those are some things that need to be constantly reminded

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.590
 and observed during the whole process to make sure it's fair and equal

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.680
 and that it gets a fair look during the investigation.
