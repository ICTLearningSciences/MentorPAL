00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.170
sailors that I see causing problems. And teams are usually sailors that

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.500
 are out for their own interests. Um, they lose track of the focus

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.820
 of the team in general. Some of the things you can do to improve that

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.140
 has come alongside, and it kind of mentor them in the meaning of what

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.470
 we're trying to do, allow them to have buy in and ownership of the

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.790
 task. And I think if they can see that by helping the team as a whole,

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.110
 if they can see that meeting the commander is intent and doing

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.440
 the right things is really gonna benefit them individually, I think

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.760
 they could come alongside and get on board with them.
