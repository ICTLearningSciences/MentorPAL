00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.310
Well, I've been stationed at many different places that I always seem

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.770
 to come back to Norfolk, Virginia, area. So I had a couple ships out

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.220
 of Norfolk, and I think it's a great location. It has the beach. It

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.680
 has a lot of different things for families to dio bin Station over

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.140
 and Roosevelt roads Puerto Rico, which is no longer a station. But that

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.600
 was a tropical island. But after a while, it did become an island

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.060
 over to New Orleans. Louisiana is exactly like you see on TV with

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.520
 Mardi Gras on Bourbon Street and and all those different things, but

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.970
 it had a very good family atmosphere when you really peeled it back

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.430
 back again to Norfolk area and now up to Washington, D. C. Where things

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.890
 are pretty hectic. Um, in the middle of all the political, um,

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.350
 hoopla. And but my family is not here with me, so they're not enjoying,

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.810
 um, that family portion is also stationed down in Fort Jackson,

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.260
 South Carolina. Very small town, um, community we loved it, had a great

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.720
 opportunity for my kids in school, um college and just family time
