I think the people that that you should be on the lookout for people who

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.930
 are self serving. I think people who are only looking for their own

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.970
 personal gain, professional gain are dangerous. I think there's,

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.000
 ah real threat to the team. If they don't have buy in on what we're

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.040
 doing as a whole or as a group, I think it really could sink the mission,

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.080
 and it could affect, um what the commander's intent is.
