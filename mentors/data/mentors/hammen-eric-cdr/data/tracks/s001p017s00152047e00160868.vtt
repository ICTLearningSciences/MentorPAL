00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.560
you know, before you move to the new location or your new duty station.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.270
 A few things that I like to do is look at the commands website and

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.980
 and see theon, Bussmann or the individual that's helping with the families.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.680
 And there are a lot of information where they have of base

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.390
 housing. Maybe you wanna live out in town, there should be links, um,

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.100
 to some approved locations out of town. They'll even talk about the

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.810
 local school systems. There is, ah, lays on for the military to the

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.520
 local school systems. So that's an individual that we like to contact

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.230
 early. We like to talk and look at local churches and maybe places

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.930
 of worship that we want to. Dio and my Children were very involved

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.640
 in sports, so I try to find places and locations of different sports

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.350
 leagues that they might be interested in, and it really start to

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.060
 see what it would be like if we lived in that area.
