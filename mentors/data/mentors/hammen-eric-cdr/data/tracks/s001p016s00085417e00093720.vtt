00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.760
to me, a dealing with stress and a job is really a three pronged attack

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.670
 that I always taken. I call it just very simply, mind, body and spirit.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.590
 Uh, make sure that my mind is sharp. So I'm reading. I'm always

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.500
 learning different things. Body. I'm making sure I'm getting sleep.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.410
 I'm eating a reasonably good food. 80 20 80% good food, 20% I can

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.320
 cheat, And then I'm making sure I'm I'm exercising. My body is moving,

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.230
 getting my blood flowing and then a third. And what I would consider

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.140
 the most important is the spirit. Making sure I'm connected to my

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.060
 God, making sure I have, ah, strong relationship with him and a group

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.970
 of fellow fellow believers to really keep me on task. So the mind

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.880
 body spirit
