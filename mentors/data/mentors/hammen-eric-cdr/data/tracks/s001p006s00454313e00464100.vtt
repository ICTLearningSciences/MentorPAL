00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.300
when you first come into this field, I think one of the priorities is

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.750
 to sit back and observe and thio. Look at those individuals that already

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.200
 there. I think the mistake is to go in full force and and try to

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.660
 take care of yourself. And in that case, I think many of the people

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.110
 that are you are supervising will consider yourself selfish. So I

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.560
 think that really as a leader, you need to observe those around you

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.010
 find who is doing what, find out who is the experts on certain things

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.460
 and get to know those. Hopefully you've done some research on where

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.910
 you're going, so you have a background. But I think that the first

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.370
 priority, really is that just sit back, observe and to see kind of

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.820
 the environment in which you're going into before you step into either

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.270
 direction of taking care of your own personal calls or diving completely

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.720
 into the individuals and ignoring your own career.
