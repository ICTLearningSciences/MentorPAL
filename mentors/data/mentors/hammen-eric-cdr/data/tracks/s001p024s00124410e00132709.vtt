I think one way to make sure that everybody has a voice is as a leader

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.020
 specifically is to have an open door policy and to really mean it.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.600
 Um Toe have make opportunities to speak to everyone, maybe even in private,

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.180
 so that they don't feel embarrassed sharing what it is. Um,

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.760
 that's one way to do it. Some. I've seen some places where they have

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.350
 put in suggestion boxes. They're locked up and they actually go through

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.930
 those suggestion boxes and talk about it, and it just creates an

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.510
 environment of collaboration. And then also, when is a good idea that's

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.090
 utilized or something that's been taken from one of those suggestions

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.680
 to give that person the credit and making sure that their everybody

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.260
 knows that they're the result of that good thing happening.
