00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.150
What kind of a funny, anecdotal story is the fact that I graduated out

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.440
 of high school with, like, a 1.7 GP A barely passed the as Fab was

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.740
 probably ranked 104 out of 109 in my class. And now I'm in a position

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.040
 where I'm teaching people how to be chaplains. I'm also in charge

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.340
 of the training education at the Pentagon for all chaplains. So if you

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.630
 want to go to graduate school, you have to come through me. So the

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.930
 person who can't spell has to really take care of your educational

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.230
 needs.
