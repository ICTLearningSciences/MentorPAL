00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.880
I think when it gets into your window for an opportunity to discuss your

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.900
 next assignments. I know as officers we have detailers and depending

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.930
 on your circumstance, if you have a e f m p family member, you can

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.950
 start talking 18 months out. If not a lot of times they want to start

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.980
 dialoguing with you for a year as the detailers responsibility,

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.000
 finale your family, but your career. And I think with open communication,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.030
 understanding what you need and you being realistic about what's

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.050
 gonna help you the best. That's when you can really get the best

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.080
 opportunity to serve.
