00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.340
so my belief is that just because it's allowed in the Navy or legal doesn't

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.820
 mean it's productive or good. So some of the things, especially

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.310
 in in regards like sexual harassment, that I would not allow our maybe

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.800
 a risky or risque photos or calendars, Um, that may maybe pinpoint

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.280
 a certain gender or put him in a certain certain way. I also don't

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.770
 allow certain type of talk that happen, especially if you're talking

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.260
 about somebody else's, uh, spouse or friend, or things along those

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.740
 Navy that not necessarily illegal but definitely detrimental to good

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.230
 order and discipline.
