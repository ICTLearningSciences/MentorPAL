00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.120
people leave the Navy for multiple reasons. Hopefully, they're leaving

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.390
 it because they felt like they accomplish the goals that they said

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.660
 a task. What we don't want is people to leave dissatisfied and unfulfilled.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.930
 And so sometimes I think people leave the Navy because they

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.200
 really didn't know, um, what they're getting into. They had a maybe

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.470
 a unrealistic expectation of what it was going to be like, maybe a location

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.740
 or station that they were going to be at. Maybe the how sexy

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.000
 the job that they were going to go to was going to be because it was

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.270
 differently in the movie that they saw. So I think that they have

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.540
 a sense of un fulfillment, and maybe that's due to also a lack of leadership.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.810
 Maybe they got under a bad chain of command which discourage

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.080
 them and didn't challenge them or didn't feel that they were necessary.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.350
 And so I think there's a variety of reasons, but really I think

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.620
 it comes down to what they thought they were getting into, and it

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.890
 didn't meet up the expectations
