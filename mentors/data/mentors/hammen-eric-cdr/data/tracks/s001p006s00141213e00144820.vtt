00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.860
amount of travel. I do really depend on the job I I held currently right

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.870
 now working at the Pentagon. I get an opportunity to travel to different

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.870
 training sites, maybe three or four times a year to do the training.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.880
 But previously on a ship. Obviously the travel is is done by

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.890
 deployment where you get the opportunity to visit other countries.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.900
 And also, when I was with naval special warfare that travels a little

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.900
 bit more robust because I had to go to different sites where they

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.910
 were training, and then as a deployed to bounce around those operating

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.920
 areas.
