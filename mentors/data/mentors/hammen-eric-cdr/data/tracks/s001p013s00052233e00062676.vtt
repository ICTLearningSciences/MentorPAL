00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.880
I think most decisions that we make conf all into a couple of different

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.900
 categories, and I believe you know, they're all really important.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.930
 But there are some that are daily decisions on you know what, um, leave

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.960
 schedule. Are they going to take, or is there special liberty involved

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.980
 and other decisions that could be even a little bit more critical

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.010
 that have more ever lasting effects? Are, um which career path?

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.040
 Um, I'm gonna go down. Or if I apply to this officer program, how is

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.070
 that going to affect What are the 2nd and 3rd order effects of this?

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.090
 Is it gonna take me out of running for advancement in my rate or

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.120
 so forth? So there is there's important decisions with personnel, and

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.150
 then there's the personal decisions off. What would happen if if this

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.170
 marriage were to dissolve and were to separate, That would be a

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.200
 long last thing important decision that they would have to make that

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.230
 I could help walk them through. Or it could be his instances. What

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.250
 are me and my shipmates gonna do tonight would be an example of a quick,

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.280
 easy but still important decision
