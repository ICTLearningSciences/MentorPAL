WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.740
the most difficult part of my training both and boot camp and as an officer

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.630
 at ODS and Chaplain School would be, I think, having to start

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.520
 from ground zero, um, taking away a little bit of my individuality,

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.420
 to understand that there's something greater out there besides myself

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.310
 and to connect me with the group at large, whether it be in boot camp

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.200
 or other officers and the officer schools or even in a chaplain

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.090
 corps. And I think that's, uh, kind of a painful process, but ultimately

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.980
 enduring and worthwhile, yeah.
