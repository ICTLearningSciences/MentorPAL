I think a junior officer can afford a very comfortable lifestyle. Um,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.230
 whether they're single, they probably have a little bit more expendable

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.420
 income where they can probably purchase. Ah, very modest place to

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.610
 live. They could have a new opportunity. Thio have social, social

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.800
 life and and live pretty much normally. What ah, starting career would

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.000
 be with family. It's a little bit more difficult, because now you're

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.190
 you're having to deal with potentially school expenses, um, extra

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.380
 food, extra insurances and things of that nature. But I think very

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.570
 comfortable. As anyone would say, maybe a police officer, fireman or

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.760
 just a earlier beginning manager would be very much similar lifestyle

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.950
 that they could live.
