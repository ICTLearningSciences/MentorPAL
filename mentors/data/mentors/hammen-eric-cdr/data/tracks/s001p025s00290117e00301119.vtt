00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.970
so dealing with grief is always the optimal thing is to do it right then

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.090
 and there. But sometimes operations, whether you're deployed and

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.210
 there's maybe a mission the next day and it's not quite feasible. So,

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.330
 um, it's real difficult, but to try to find in the individual time

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.440
 for that person to have access to resource is one of the things that

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.560
 we did as chaplains is we were able to embed with the teams and all

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.680
 of a sudden, now you have an instant councilor. There s so many times

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.800
 they would go out on ops and deal with some traumatic issues, sometimes

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.920
 loss. And I was there when they came back and I was there. It

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.040
 was somebody familiar that they could talk Thio. It didn't fix the

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.160
 situation, But then to make sure that once we return that we could

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.280
 spend some real time as as a unit, And the danger is that when you return

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.390
 from combat, everybody separates and and goes their own way. But

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.510
 it's really key and important that individuals get that time to decompress

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.630
 together and to share stories and to share experiences to

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.750
 make sure that they're kind of resetting before they take off and go

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.870
 to the next mission.
