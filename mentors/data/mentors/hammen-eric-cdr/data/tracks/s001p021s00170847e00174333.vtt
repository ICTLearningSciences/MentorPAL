00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.720
I think the opportunities to change fields or professional fields is endless.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.600
 I think we always are students of learning, and we always should

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.470
 be striving to do our best. So I think if we have everything taken

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.340
 care of all of your calls, air done and and you're ready for the

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.220
 next challenge I don't know any supervisor who would be disappointed

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.090
 with that person reaching for the next challenge. I myself went from

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.960
 a radioman to a legal men to a chaplain, Um, not neglecting my current

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.840
 job, but always looking ahead. So what is the next challenge?
