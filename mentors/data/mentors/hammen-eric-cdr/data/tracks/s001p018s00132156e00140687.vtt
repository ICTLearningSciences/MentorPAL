00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.620
I think, um, any individual who joins the military should really, um,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.400
 could start considering retirement because we know that compound interest

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.170
 works mysterious way in the earlier you start, the better off

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.950
 you're gonna be. And even if you do not decide to make the military

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.720
 career with the new TSP system, they're matching funds, and you're able

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.500
 to take that money with you at your next career. And if you have

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.270
 a federal career, you could just continue in the TSP, um, system. And

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.050
 if not, you could take that money and it's still gonna grow. So I

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.820
 think early is better. Um, I think if you spend everything right away

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.600
 thinking that you're just gonna you're gonna be fine in the future.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.370
 That's when you see people struggling as they get ready to retire.
