I think some leadership strategies that air dying out are are really just,

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.880
 uh, owning and taking responsibility. What I'm seeing a lot of

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.390
 is people pointing fingers and kind of walking away from an opportunity

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.900
 to really claim it and to fix it. And I believe that's important

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.420
 for subordinates to see you taking a responsibility as a leader, it

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.930
 shows ownership. It shows courage, and it gives them permission to

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.440
 trust you that if something does happen, that you will own up to it

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.960
 and that you will take that responsibility sometimes even when it's

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.470
 not your fault.
