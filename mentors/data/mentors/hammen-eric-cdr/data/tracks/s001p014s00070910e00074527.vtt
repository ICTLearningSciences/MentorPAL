00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.370
I think the coolest thing that I've done in the Navy and I've done many

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.890
 things, and one thing I can think of is getting an opportunity to

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.410
 fly almost every day. But the Marine aircraft wing in the back of a

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.930
 Huey with the doors open through the mountains of Afghanistan. And as

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.460
 we're taking off, they were talking to the tower and they would tell

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.980
 the tower they're ready to go. They have gas, guns and God, and they

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.500
 took off, and that was one of the favorite things that I can't remember.
