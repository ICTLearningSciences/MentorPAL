00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.450
So throughout my career, I've been fortunate to receive a lot of different

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.040
 awards. I've received everything from a nem sm to multiple Navy

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.640
 calms, uh, been awarded higher ribbons, that it may have not been given

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.230
 to me because of my position. But there's it was tons of opportunities

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.830
 to get different things and different theaters of activity that

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.430
 I served in. And so, unfortunately, I've never received the the

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.020
 only awards that the enemy can give, which is the Purple Heart and a

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.620
 combat action ribbon. But I'm okay with that.
