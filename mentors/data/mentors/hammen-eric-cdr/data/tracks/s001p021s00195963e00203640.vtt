00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.450
I think educational benefits in the Navy work in different ways whether

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.040
 you're enlisted and you utilize, uh, tuition assistance or even some

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.640
 officers. So because I'm a chaplain already with a master's degree

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.230
 when I enter, I do not qualify for those things. But however, I do

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.830
 qualify to use my G i bill if I needed Thio. And there's also programs

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.430
 within the chaplain corps that sends, oh, Force elects Thio another

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.020
 graduate degree. There is, uh, programs that sends us to the war

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.620
 college and also to hospitals to do clinical pastoral education.
