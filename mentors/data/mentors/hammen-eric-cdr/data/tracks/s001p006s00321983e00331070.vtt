00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.090
as a leader, its's very important to observe the people that are surrounding

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.330
 you that are under you and making sure that there are not things

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.570
 that are going to get out of hand. Um, something that's really going

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.810
 to disrupt the flow. And I think some of those things that are,

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.050
 um, trust I think that if if you as a leader can present yourself as

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.290
 a trustworthy individual, someone who is gonna maybe take the criticism

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.520
 from the higher ups and filtering it down to their people below

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.760
 them, I think that's a big win. I think that if you are the individual

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.000
 who continuously turns and points fingers, that is something that

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.240
 needs to be rooted out very quickly because people are not gonna

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.480
 follow you. And even if they do something to your face behind you, there

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.720
 are gonna undermine you at every opportunity.
