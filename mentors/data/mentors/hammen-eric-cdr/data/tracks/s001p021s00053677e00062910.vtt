I think the Navy within their publications has a really big push for mentorship.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.900
 And that's somebody that may not necessarily be like you,

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.930
 but someone that you could come alongside to grow, maybe someone that

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.950
 you aspire to be. So before I make choices, I obviously first go

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.980
 to my family because it affects them and their well being. And then

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.000
 I will go to individuals that I have trusted over the time, not someone

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.030
 who if it's a marriage situation, I'm not gonna ask the person that

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.050
 was divorced five times I'm gonna talk Thio, maybe the chaplain

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.080
 or maybe someone who has a marriage in which I respect. If it's a career

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.100
 issue, I'm gonna look to people who are doing good things in their

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.130
 career, maybe people who are the ones that are on top and so on

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.150
 where they want to get Ah, good grasp of many different circumstances

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.180
 around me so I could make the best decision
