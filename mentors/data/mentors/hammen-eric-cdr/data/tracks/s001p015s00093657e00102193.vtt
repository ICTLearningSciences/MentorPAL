00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.380
you know as a chaplain were faced with a lot of immoral issues that come

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.920
 up. They may be legal in certain situations, but one issue that I

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.450
 can really remember standing up to and it's not common just to me is,

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.990
 you know, the fact of of pornography, within workspaces or within

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.520
 people's personal possession, to have to stand up and say, Hey, this

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.060
 is not right. This is You should have these posters up because we

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.590
 have mixed crew and this could offend certain individuals. And although

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.130
 it made me less popular with certain divisions, it was the right

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.660
 thing to do, and it made it a safer environment for everybody to enjoy

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.200
 and get the job done.
