00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.820
I think some warning signs that you'll see on a team, especially when

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.800
 it starts to become a problem, is, um, self serving. You'll start to

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.770
 see people who, uh, forget to look at the whole team, and they start

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.750
 to look at themselves individually and they make it off track. They

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.720
 may lose focus on where they would be, and and really, it's difficult

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.690
 to trust an individual who's out there just for themselves and not

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.670
 to say that self can't benefit from a successful team, because I

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.640
 think that's an accurate statement. But to really just look at yourself

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.620
 as the end and be all, I think that's very dangerous on the team.
