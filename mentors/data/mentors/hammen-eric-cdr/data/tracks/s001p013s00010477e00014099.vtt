I think one thing that makes my leadership style unique is my transparency.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.200
 I've been told before and actually recently, that people have

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.370
 seen me as a more junior officer and now is a senior officer that I

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.550
 haven't changed, that I'm still the same person, that if something is

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.720
 wrong or or even if something is right that I'm focused on it, I I

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.900
 am able to share it and talk about the details. And I think it just

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.070
 makes for ah, more trust. And it shows, I guess my humbleness.
