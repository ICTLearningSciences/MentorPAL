00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.270
one of the biggest failures I had in the Navy came when I was enlisted

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.700
 and I had an opportunity to get my s twas qualification at that point,

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.120
 uh, of my career, I was thinking about getting out, and so I stopped

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.550
 my s Twas even though I was only a few days away from receiving

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.970
 it because I thought I was getting out of the Navy. Lo and behold,

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.400
 I reenlisted and stayed in for another 25 years. And as you can see,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.820
 I do not have my East waas.
