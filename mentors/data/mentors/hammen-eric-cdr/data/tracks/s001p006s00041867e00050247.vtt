The beautiful thing about the Navy is we get, we get, we don't get paid

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.610
 way, don't get paid by the hour. We get paid a salary, which means

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.990
 that we're always on the clock. Things are always happening. Life happens.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.370
 Um, and so we work. Depends if you're underway. You have seven

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.750
 day work days with maybe an opportunity for, ah break on Sunday,

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.130
 or maybe a separate day when missions are not happening. Um, to when

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.510
 you're back from deployment, when you have an opportunity to thio,

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.890
 recharge your batteries and to spend time with family and to get an

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.270
 opportunity to, um, maybe have half days where you can take care of

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.650
 things that need to be done either personally or professionally.
