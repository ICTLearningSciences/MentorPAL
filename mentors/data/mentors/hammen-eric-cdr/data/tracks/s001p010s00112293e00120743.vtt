00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.300
I think most people, um, in general respond well to a servant leadership,

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.750
 um, style, because it enables you to prove and to showcase that

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.200
 you have been there too, and are willing thio do the same things that

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.650
 you're asking them to dio I think when we're talking about executive

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.100
 leadership, that becomes more difficult because ah, lot of people

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.550
 look to those individuals as the strength of the organization and for

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.000
 them toe to come down and to really get into the weeds is counterproductive.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.450
 But in general, I think a servant leader is somebody that

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.900
 could be respected and, quite frankly, is someone that most people

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.350
 want to follow.
