00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.520
As my career has progressed, my priorities have changed. Um, in s so much.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.180
 Whereas I'm not so much looking at my own career, but how I can

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.850
 affect others below me. What sort of things can I do as a leader, as

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.520
 a person to pour my knowledge, my skill set into them so they can

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.180
 then expand their path and they're meeting. I think by doing that, uh,

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.850
 it does affect me as a leader because their success and their good

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.520
 fortune ultimately pushes up to me. Even though that is not necessarily

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.180
 my intent. It's just a secondary cause. And both us, me and the

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.850
 individual, which I'm leading, reaps the benefit of that.
