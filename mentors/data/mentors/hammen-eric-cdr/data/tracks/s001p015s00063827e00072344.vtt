00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.960
I think taking the blame for problems that you don't cause is something

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.060
 that I think is diminishing in the military. I think at some point

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.170
 it could be harmful when the maybe the same individual is is repeating

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.280
 the same mistake over and over, and there needs to be some accountability.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.380
 In order for that person to really get it, Thio correct it

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.490
 and to go forward. But I think as a leader, to develop some trust

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.590
 with your people, to take the heat off of them and allow them to really

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.700
 focus and function as a team. There is a time to take that blame,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.810
 and especially if it's not gonna hurt anything in the long run, and

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.910
 it just proves to your team that you're there to protect them and

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.020
 they can trust you.
