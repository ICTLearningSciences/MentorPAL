00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.510
so a conflict I've had with my career. My family life is something that

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.180
 I'm actually dealing with right now. I've been stationed at the Pentagon

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.840
 and my family lives in Virginia Beach. And so what I do is I

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.500
 go home every weekend to be with my family, and I live here during the

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.170
 week. And so it was a sacrifice that we had to make for, really,

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.830
 for the betterment of my career right now, understanding that this is

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.500
 going to pay dividends in the long run, but still the stress of having

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.160
 two of my Children who are still at home, that I am not there during

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.820
 the week for them, and now my wife is basically a single mom having

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.490
 to deal with things. But is it definitely a conflict that we're

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.150
 dealing with currently?
