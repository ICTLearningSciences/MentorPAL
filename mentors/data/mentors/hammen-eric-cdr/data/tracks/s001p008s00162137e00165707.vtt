I think something's critical review when starting a new ship would be,

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.050
 um, everything from the platform. The personnel are key the demographics

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.150
 Before every person Chaplain really sets foot on the ship and

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.250
 starts going, they do. Ah, religious needs assessment. So what does

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.350
 the ship look like? A Sfar, as that's concerned. Um, what kind of beliefs

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.450
 are represented on that ship? And so I think those are all important

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.550
 things to really look at once, um, taking a ship.
