00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.190
I think the biggest risk that I've taken was actually becoming commissioned.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.540
 So as an enlisted sailor I was. I was up for E seven. I had all

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.880
 the marks. I was a e p sailor. I had the backing of my community

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.220
 and I was I was poised to make Chief, and I had to take a risk of of

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.560
 actually getting out, finishing my graduate degree and start over as

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.910
 an instant. So I think, to go from something very comfortable to nothing

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.250
 to the reward now toe where I'm at 28 years later as a commander.
