The one thing that really causes the most stress in my job is if I feel

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.920
 that people can't get a hold of me. I've had a situation where I was

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.960
 in a building that did not get cell phone reception and an individual

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.000
 had attempted to call me because they were considering taking their

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.030
 lives. I never got the phone call. That individual did end up taking

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.070
 their life. And I only found out later that they did try to call

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.110
 and could not reach me. I understand it was not my fault this individual

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.150
 was reaching out for help. But it still to this day, uh, stresses

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.180
 me out when I'm when I'm unreachable to my sailors, to my Marines,

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.220
 to the Coast Guardsman.
