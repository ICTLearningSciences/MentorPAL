00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.760
you know, some unique things that you might need to do to prepare overseas

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.680
 is really dependent on the location. Sometimes they may have a

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.590
 restriction about animals that you could bring over, and so there's

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.500
 a could be a quarantine. Sometimes there's even a restriction on what

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.420
 kind of vehicles that you have. Are you moving, um, to Italy, where

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.330
 the cars are much smaller and you have Ah ah, Cadillac Escalade that

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.240
 might not work. And so really finding out where that host country,

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.160
 what their needs are and the things that you have currently, and how

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.070
 does that fit into that new duty station?
