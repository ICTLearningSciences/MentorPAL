00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.730
chaplains are eligible for combat action ribbons because that is a ribbon

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.620
 that is not awarded by the command but by the enemy. And so if the

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.500
 chapel was in, uh, the circumstance that was given, then they will

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.380
 receive that if the unit reports the engagement.
