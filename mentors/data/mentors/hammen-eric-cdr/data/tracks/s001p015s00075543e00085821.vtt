00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.330
so having a disagreement with other people in the team is common. And

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.820
 one example I can think of as I was standing, um, the chaplain Corps

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.300
 duty. We had a death on the base and I was the duty chaplain to respond.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.790
 But instead of me necessary responding, I chose to contact their

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.270
 chaplain and their chaplain would not respond for some reason whether

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.760
 they were unable to because of location. And so my agreement was

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.240
 I think that it was appropriate for them to respond because they were

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.720
 going to deal with the backlash. They were going to deal with the

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.210
 how that's gonna happen with the family, and I would been there just

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.690
 for one day and they would never have seen me again. And so there

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.180
 was a disagreement on who is supposed to respond. And I was trying

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.660
 Thio look further than just the moment in the one day and trying to

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.150
 look further down the line of how is this gonna affect it? Long term
