working with atheist is is no different than working, working with someone

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.750
 who is agnostic or even a believer. Um, everybody has their own

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.210
 understanding of the meaning of life, and so atheism is really a belief

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.660
 in what they think is the meaning of life. So it's no different

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.110
 than someone who says there's a Christian or a Muslim or a Jehovah's

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.560
 Witness. Um, it's all in the same category, all comes down to a belief,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.020
 and I think treating people across the board with respect and

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.470
 honoring them doesn't mean you necessarily agree with them, but it gives

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.920
 them a voice to their thoughts.
