00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.820
Yeah, there are. There are many problems that really need a specialist,

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.800
 touch to it or expertise. And I tend to look at things into three

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.770
 major categories. And those symptoms come in one way, shape or form

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.750
 in those categories. And that's the mind, the body and the spirit. And

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.720
 we see when people black sleep or they're not sleeping well or their

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.690
 diet is not correct or they're exercise. Um, those can really lead

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.670
 into a lot of different things where that person might be depressed,

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.640
 maybe going through some issues at home, maybe even considering,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.620
 um, harming themselves. Also, we see that with with their mind, if

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.590
 if they're not actively engaged, if he starts seeing, um, symptoms of

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.560
 things where they just don't care about different things or they're

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.540
 disinterested, those also could be symptoms that psychiatrist or psychologist

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.510
 or a chaplain could kind of walk through. And and even from

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.480
 my perspective, spiritually, a lot of people who are struggling

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.460
 with that, um, could be a real symptom of something greater in her life

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.430
 of, of meaning, of Why are they here? What's the use of it all anyway?

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.410
 So those types of symptoms that you will see within the mind.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.380
 The body and spirit are really opportunities for you to ask that person

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.350
 to go see professional help for them to go talk to the chaplain

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.330
 and allow the chaplain to kind of refer them out to either a psychologist

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.300
 or family life services or or just any place that they might

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.280
 seem would be a benefit that can really get them in the right frame

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.250
 of mind.
