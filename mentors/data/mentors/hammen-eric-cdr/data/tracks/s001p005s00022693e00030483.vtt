00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.590
the work I do on a typical day currently now is one of administrative.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.330
 We have an opportunity in the chaplain corps to shape strategic thinking

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.060
 and how we are going to do ministry in the future, maybe 10 years,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.800
 15 years down the road. So it's my privilege to get that chance

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.540
 to write training, to meet those requirements again, opportunity to

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.280
 share that to the fleet and present those opportunities and pushing

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.010
 leadership down to them so they have that chance and opportunity to

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.750
 lead from their echelon and their point of contact.
