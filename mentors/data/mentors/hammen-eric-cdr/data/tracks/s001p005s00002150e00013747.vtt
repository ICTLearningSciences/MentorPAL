00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.910
my major leadership roles ultimately came down to is when I became ah,

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.980
 chaplain, and the first one I can think of is as as an instructor at

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.040
 the Chaplain School, I was the person that people would look thio

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.110
 in leadership roles. And that was precisely. My job is to mold and shape

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.170
 junior officers many times civilians with no military experience,

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.240
 or even people who had military experience both enlisted or as a

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.300
 former officer, and then to shape them and help them kind of around

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.370
 some of the rough edges what it's like to serve as an officer in the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.430
 chaplain corps. The second major opportunity had in leadership was

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.500
 on L. A P. D. U S s San Antonio, where I was a department head of my

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.560
 chaplain department but also asked to lead and mentor a department

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.630
 executive, um, staff, where I had other swell officers under me. Various

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.690
 rates, administrative rates, PMS, y ends and such. Where I had

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.760
 a different role, um, or traditional leadership style where I got to

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.820
 help shape the evil and fit rep process within that avenue
