So all four of my Children were actually born while I was on active duty,

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.340
 and two of them were born on naval bases and naval hospitals, one

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.590
 in Roosevelt roads, Puerto Rico and one in, uh, Portsmouth, Norfolk.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.840
 And two of them were born in civilian hospitals in New Orleans, Louisiana.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.090

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.330
