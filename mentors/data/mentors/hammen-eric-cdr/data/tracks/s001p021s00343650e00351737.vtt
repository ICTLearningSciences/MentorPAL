00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.940
I think each duty station that you go to there is, ah, on opportunities

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.020
 for challenging new skills to learn. Um, I kind of associate me and

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.110
 my role is a chaplain. Is is a missionary and going to a different

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.200
 place. And so I get to that duty station. I have to learn how the people

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.280
 talk. What do they look like? What do they wear? And I assess

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.370
 that situation, and so that's a learning process for me. Before I really

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.460
 dive into getting them, they have to earn my trust. They have to

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.550
 understand, um, them there for the long haul and so that in it by

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.630
 itself is challenging. It's exciting, but it's an opportunity in a process

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.720
 that we have to go through.
