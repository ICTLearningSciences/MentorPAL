 Corman or a dock on this ship or at your command, that would generate

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.960
 potentially a report or if there was an attempt that would generate

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.230
 a report on the medical side which the command may somehow find

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.510
 out.
