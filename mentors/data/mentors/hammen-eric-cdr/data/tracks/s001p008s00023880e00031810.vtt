00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.760
being a chaplain is is something that no other I believe designator can

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.670
 to really understand. Um, because it za calling. It's something that

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.590
 we don't choose to be because we think it will be fun or an opportunity

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.500
 to do a specific thing. But it's something outside of ourselves.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.410
 It's an opportunity for us to serve the God who has called us to

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.320
 do this. And it's an opportunity for us to to care and thio love all

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.240
 people regardless of their faith, and to really just live as an example

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.150
 of what we believe in, how we want to do business.
