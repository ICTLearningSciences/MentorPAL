00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.310
so as a leader, especially getting ready for deployment there, there's

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.770
 a different perspective that you need to take care of. Obviously, you

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.230
 need to take care of yourself individually, just like on a plane.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.690
 If there's an incident, you put the mask on yourself before you. You

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.150
 go to the person next to you, but as a leader, you're taking care

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.610
 of yourself. But then you're looking to the people that work for you

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.070
 and making sure that they're taking care of making sure that your giving

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.530
 them the resource is that they need Thio prepare for their family.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.990
 The legal resource is the wills, the general power of attorneys

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.460
 making sure that they have, um, something to communicate with their

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.920
 family. So they understand the parameters of where they're going to

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.380
 be at the limitations that they're gonna have, and just things that

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.840
 are going to connect them back to it. And then the last thing I would

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.300
 probably make sure I have is some stuff that I can use to train.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.760
 Whether it's something as simple as bringing some leadership books,

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.220
 things that we can read together and to grow together, and some resource

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.680
 is along those lines, I think those are all really key things to

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.140
 look at, especially as a leader
