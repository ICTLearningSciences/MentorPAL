00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.550
I mean, I think there's a lot of different important factors that shape

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.240
 your future. You know, taking care of yourself, making sure you're

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.940
 hitting the right career milestones, whether that's education or schools.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.630
 But I think something that people really neglect to do and to

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.330
 look at is to really take care of their family instead of chasing the

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.030
 goal of your career and knowing even if it lasts for 20 years, at

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.720
 one day you're going to sit across the table from the person that you

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.420
 eventually married and those Children that you raised, and to know

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.110
 who they are, I think, is the most important thing that we can dio

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.810
 and the most important investment that we could make.
