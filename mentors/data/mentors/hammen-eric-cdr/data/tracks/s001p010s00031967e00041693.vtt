00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.620
things I like to dio What I'm leading by example is the first thing I

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.390
 want to do is, uh, transparency, eso everything. I dio make sure that

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.170
 I'm communicating. Another thing I wanna make sure that I do is that

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.940
 I lied in my time. My time management. I wanna be the first one there

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.710
 before Everybody else I wanna be the last one. I wanna be a dependable

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.480
 And so when there is discussion about what their expectations

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.250
 are, they can look to me and see that I'm modeling exactly what I

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.020
 say. I'm gonna dio. Also I wanted, as I'm leading by example is is pushed

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.800
 out the fact that it's okay to fail. Um, so when I make mistakes

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.570
 as a leader, I wanna be the first one to step up and to admit to

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.340
 that and show that it happens and that we can move past it and you could

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.110
 still be effective by taking chances and by making mistakes
