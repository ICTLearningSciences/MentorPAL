00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.900
So in the Navy and even in the civilian world, there's a list of kind

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.940
 of suicidal risks that you would see someone particular participate

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.990
 in. That may be a trigger or something to observe, but the common denominator

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.030
 for all suicide or death by suicides is loss, and that could

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.080
 be loss of a relationship. Could be loss of status. Money rank could

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.120
 be lost of ah, pet could be loss of freedom. Um, but really looking

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.170
 at those things and taking it serious when you start seeing those

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.210
 symptoms, whether they're giving things away, whether they're different

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.260
 than they were before, Just because somebody is happy or acting

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.300
 happy doesn't mean they're not suicidal. In fact, sometimes people

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.350
 act happy when they have a plan to end their life because they feel

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.400
 like it's almost over. So there is some very common misconceptions

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.440
 about that. But looking for lost an individual's life is a trigger that

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.490
 I would do as a professional Azam counseling somebody and talking

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.530
 to them and then being forthright and asking them saying something

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.580
 along the lines of Hey, you know, people who have this circumstance

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.620
 that happened to him. Whatever it is, sometimes they think about killing

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.670
 themselves, that something you've thought about and bringing it

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.710
 to the point and you may get a response of No, that's not anything

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.760
 that I'm thinking about or you're crazy or, you know, thank you for

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.800
 asking. I have had thoughts which will then open up a dialogue, that

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.850
 we can have a real conversation.
