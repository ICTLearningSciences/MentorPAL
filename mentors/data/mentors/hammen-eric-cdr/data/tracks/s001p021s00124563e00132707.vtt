So one question that I think is important for us to realize is when we're

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.140
 talking about mentorship in a relationship, it's not just the mentor

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.280
 teaching the mentee. I think there's a lot that the mentee can

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.430
 really teach that mentor. It's both ways. Not only that is, I think

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.570
 even if you think that you're at the bottom level and you're the one

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.710
 being mentored, there's always somebody below you that needs the same

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.860
 type of mentorship. So as you are seeking out a mentor, you should

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.000
 be seeking out someone that you can mentor yourself, and I think that

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.150
 will be very holistic for you. It gives yourself a 3 60 view of

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.290
 your own personality and would be beneficial both ways.
