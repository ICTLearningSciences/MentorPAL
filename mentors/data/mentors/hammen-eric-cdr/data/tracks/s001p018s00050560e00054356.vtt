I think there's times when you need to find your own housing. Um, for

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.290
 instance, if the housing is wait, list is too long and you're not able

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.510
 Thio, get in at a normal time. Uh, maybe it doesn't meet the needs

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.730
 of your family. Maybe the house they're gonna give you is to small

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.940
 and you want Ah, larger room. Another thing that they think about us

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.160
 faras when you'd want to be out in town, is maybe your B H is at a

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.380
 level where it's more than you need to live out in town. So your ableto

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.600
 maybe save a little bit of money by living out in town than by

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.820
 going on base where they take your entire BH.
