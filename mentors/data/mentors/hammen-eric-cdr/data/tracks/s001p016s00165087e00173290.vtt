00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.050
I think that my biggest weakness actually was maybe public speaking. And

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.260
 it's something that I work worked on to improve as a as a chaplain,

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.460
 you'd expect me to be able to go up in front of people and and talk

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.660
 to him and speak to them off the cuff. But it wasn't till I began

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.870
 a job teaching in between my enlisted. An officer career where I was

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.070
 in a classroom every single day in front of students were really honed,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.270
 that skill to speak in front of others. And so I think now I'm

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.470
 in a place where I'm very comfortable that I can pretty much go into

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.680
 any size room and take care of the crowd and not feel nervous or out

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.880
 of touch.
