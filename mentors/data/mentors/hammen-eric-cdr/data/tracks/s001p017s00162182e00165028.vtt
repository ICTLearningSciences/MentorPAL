00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.590
some things that might fall through the cracks is really when you're actually

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.340
 moving is the taking care of the details as far as having somebody

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.080
 there picking up your goods and then having somebody, um, to

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.820
 receive the goods. And I think that people regret not being more thorough

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.570
 in that situation because things get damaged, things come up missing,

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.310
 and that creates a kind of a mess on the back end.
