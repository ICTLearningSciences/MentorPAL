I think when people get bonuses, um, I would say most of the time they

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.310
 abuse it and buy something with it. I e. A car or motorcycle or something

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.540
 that would be considered perishable and not maintaining its value.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.770
 Where I've seen people really succeed is by taking their bonus

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.000
 and investing in it and putting it into something much more reliable,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.230
 maybe adding it to their their TSP. And I know it's it's not sexy

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.460
 and it doesn't satisfy their needs right down in there. But in 20 years,

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.690
 when they retire, they're gonna they're gonna be really glad they

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.920
 did that.
