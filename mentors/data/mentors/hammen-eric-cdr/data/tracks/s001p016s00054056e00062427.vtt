00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.220
I think a pivoted, pivotal moment in my life definitely had to be when

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.590
 I went from enlisted to officer. I think there was a lot of people

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.960
 in my life saying that I couldn't do it or a lot of people in my pathway

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.330
 that said, This is not possible. You're never gonna make it. And

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.700
 then for me, Thio have certain people to come alongside and really

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.070
 be my cheerleader, especially my family. And then to be able to, um,

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.440
 accomplish that goal, get commissioned And then even at some point,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.810
 to run into the same individuals who say that I wasn't gonna make

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.180
 it and see the look in their eyes and the and the doubt that they had

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.550
 turned into wow, this guy really did it.
