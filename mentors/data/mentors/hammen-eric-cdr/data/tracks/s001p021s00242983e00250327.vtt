00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.630
eso a person I considered as a role model early in my life would probably

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.400
 happen to be my father in law. He served in the Navy 27 years, retired

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.180
 as a senior chief, but always encouraging. Always there for his

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.960
 family. Um, he's at church every single Sunday, um, sitting with

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.740
 his family still to this day and taking care of them even after retirement.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.510
 Getting another job to help out S O. He is probably one of the

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.290
 people I've looked to as a role model for my entire career.
