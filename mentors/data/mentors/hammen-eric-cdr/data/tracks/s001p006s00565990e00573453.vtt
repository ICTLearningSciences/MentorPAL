I think there's Ah many different leadership styles and books. And just

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.740
 by a quick glance at the Barnes and Noble self help, I'll you can

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.690
 see that. But one that I have recently read, and that I think is really

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.640
 keen is Jim Mattis is book call sign Chaos, which breaks down different

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.590
 leadership styles and obviously, ah, very successful leadership

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.530
 style that he carried on through the Marine Corps and and then through

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.480
 civilian service.
