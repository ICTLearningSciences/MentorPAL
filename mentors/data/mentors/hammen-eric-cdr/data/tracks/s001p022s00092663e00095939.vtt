00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.940
So if you observe as a leader somebody else being harassed, I think it

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.040
 needs to be addressed right away. See something? Say something. I believe

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.130
 if you create a culture of that, it's unacceptable at any level.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.230
 I don't believe you have to necessary. Come off the top rope, but

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.320
 to come alongside and point out what is wrong, what your expectations

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.420
 are and that it's not gonna be accepted. That would probably curtail

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.510
 much of the future potential sexual harassment, at least in your

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.610
 division.
