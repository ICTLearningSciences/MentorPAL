00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.780
I think handling people who aren't meeting the standard is is Anak two

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.720
 of a good leader is coaching is to come alongside and and maybe address

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.650
 some of the things that they're doing really well and then focusing

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.580
 on some things that they could do to improve. I think incremental

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.510
 improvements, even if small, are big victories, and that will kind

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.450
 of snowball effect, um, to them getting to where they need to be with

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.380
 the rest of the team.
