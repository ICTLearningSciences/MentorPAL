00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.530
One question I probably would like to have known early in her career is

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.220
 you know what is success? A za chaplain. And within my faith, success

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.900
 means something very different. It means my contentment, my service

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.580
 to God and how I approach that relationship and how I deal with

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.270
 people. Why, while success as a leader in the military, uh, much of

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.950
 it has to do with is my rank and my positions that I held in. Do the

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.640
 people who serve under me respect me and want to follow me and have

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.320
 the same intent? And so to really understand, that answer is, um, is

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.000
 yes to both, uh, the bloom where you're planted your position of authority,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.690
 whether that's rank, whether that's location and bill it,

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.370
 Yes, do it all to the best of your ability. And by doing so, you serve

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.050
 both your spiritual side, which is your service to God and and both

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.740
 you're gonna do the people that serve under you, right? Injustice

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.420
 by being fair and honest and being successful in that realm,
