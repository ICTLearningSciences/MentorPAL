00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.450
I think some of the things that make a good leaders, first of all, good

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.050
 leaders read their students of history. They are understanding of

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.660
 what has gone before them and not doomed to repeat the negative things

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.260
 that happened before us. Um, their understanding of a wide swath

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.860
 of individuals, not necessarily their specific leadership style. Ah,

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.460
 good Leader also is someone who can look at its people and understand,

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.070
 um, their intense, different studies such as Myer, Briggs or Hogan

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.670
 Assessments, could be key in deciding where their individuals fit

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.270
 and also a good leader, I believe really gives opportunities for the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.870
 people under them. Thio serve opportunities for the people under them

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.480
 to lead and take risks and chances. The leader's role is toe to

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.080
 take the responsibility off of them and give them opportunities to fail.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.680
 And so I think that's where their development really shows. That's

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.280
 where they can really, uh, make the most money for the organization,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.890
 which is the Navy. And that's gonna formulate their leadership

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.490
 style as they go forward and hopefully glean some, um, nuggets of what

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.090
 you have given them
