00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.410
I think a couple of things that I that I do well as a leader is is. One

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.960
 is I don't take myself too serious and I'm able to roll with the punches,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.520
 understand that people are gonna be uncomfortable, maybe even

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.080
 around me, sometimes because of my position as a chaplain or a senior

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.630
 leader. Another characteristic that people might say is again my

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.190
 transparency, the way that I'm very quick to communicate things that

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.740
 I think is important, whether it's good or it's bad and also my ability

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:45.300
 to stay pretty consistent in my leadership style. A Sfar as I

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.860
 don't I don't waiver one way or the other. Uh, I don't get too high,

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.410
 uh, in emotions, and I don't also get too low. I'm pretty consistent

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.970
 and something that they can look Thio and expect from me.
