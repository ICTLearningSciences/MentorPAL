I think as a leader, when you're sharing personal stories that it has

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.330
 to be situational awareness. I don't believe that something you you

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.570
 lead off with or start with. I think there is a little bit of a trust,

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.810
 Um, that needs to be built up. But for me, as a chaplain, if someone

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.050
 comes to me and is struggling with a circumstance or a situation

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.290
 and me sharing maybe, uh, anecdotal, uh, similar circumstance might

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.530
 bring a connection to them. And they may feel, um, or kindred spirit

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.770
 and and share mawr information. Or understand that I may have a little

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.010
 bit of background in this and I can trust this individual, so it

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.250
 really just depends on the circumstance and situation.
