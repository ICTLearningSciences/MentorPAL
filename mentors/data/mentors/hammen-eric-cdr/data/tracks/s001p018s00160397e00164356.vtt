00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.250
I think the Navy, just like any other time or any other occupation really

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.650
 gives you opens up the opportunity for any activities. I know myself,

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.050
 I enjoy surfing. So when I get stationed over in places such as

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.450
 Virginia Beach, I have an opportunity to go out in the water. Now

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.850
 I'm here at the Pentagon. Not a lot of surf here, but I could take a

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.250
 stand up paddleboard into Potomac. But really, any activity that you

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.650
 enjoy a civilian is almost a zoo. Long as it's legal, it's acceptable

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.050
 within the military. And just depending on where you're stationed,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.450
 um, depends on what you can dio.
