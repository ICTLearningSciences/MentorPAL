00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.090
so the Navy has done a really good job realigning even the names of their

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.340
 ratings to make it Maura aligned with civilian counterparts, For

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.580
 instance, uh, cooks used to be called mess specialist, but when they

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.820
 went to get a job out in town as a cook or a culinary person, they

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.060
 don't understand what a mess specialist was now their culinary specialist.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.310
 So getting a job coming from a culinary specialist Avenue is

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.550
 easily aligned to the civilian world, and so they've done great pains

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.790
 to do that, also to upping their qualification. So, for instance,

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.030
 ah, legal men now will leave the Navy with the peril legal qualifications

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.280
 that will transfer right into the civilian world so continuously

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.520
 working on those opportunities.
