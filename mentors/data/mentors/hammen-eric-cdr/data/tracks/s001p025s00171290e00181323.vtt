00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.870
so as a ZA leader. And I know of somebody who's at a high suicide risk

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.890
 and has access to weapons is unfortunately, if it's your own personal

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.920
 weapons, I'm gonna ask them permission to restore them on. I'm not

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.940
 gonna It's not gonna be not attribute. Ally. Don't have toe not gonna

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.960
 be punished. But just while they're doing with their circumstances,

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.980
 if if they have a friend or even a family member, that can keep

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.000
 those weapons from them. And sometimes it's not guns. Sometimes it's

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.030
 it's medication or other things. And so to be able to remove that temptation

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.050
 from that individual is critical. Now, if it's a duty status

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.070
 thing and that individual is on suicide watch, they will not be in

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.090
 a position to carry a weapon on this ship or to be in a place to damage

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.110
 themselves. So we have to take those considerations and always

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.140
 underpinning it with that. They're not being punished, that we're doing

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.160
 it because we care for them and we want them to get past that.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.180
 And once they're past that to bail to reinstate those privileges
