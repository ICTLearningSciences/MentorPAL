00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.960
I think in today's Navy, um, specifically, with all the mishaps recently

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.080
 having within the ships and the ship drivers, I think failure is

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.190
 accepted a za long as all precautions were taken and it was honest try.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.310
 I think that in order to have success in order to be to a place

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.420
 where you want to be a good leader, failure has to be part of the equation.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.540
 And I think there is a book written called Permission to Fail.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.650
 And I think that gives us that opportunity to, um, continue to make

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.770
 those attempts continue to want to be better and want to grow, and

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.880
 I think failure is a big part of that.
