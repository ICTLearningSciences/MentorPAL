00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.990
I think one of the biggest tips that you can have a deal with grief is

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.130
 sometimes people use is a cop out answer. But really, the only thing

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.270
 that really deals with grief is time separation. And when I when I'm

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.410
 speaking with individual who's who's angry, first of all, ah, much

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.550
 quieter and I'm allowing them to really, um, lead the conversation.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.690
 But then to tell them and allow them to understand that it's not always

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.820
 going to feel this way. And for anybody who's experienced death,

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.960
 they don't feel ast. Time goes by, they think about it less and less,

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.100
 and it becomes less, uh and therefore front of their mind. And

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.240
 so I would say the best thing and best advice is, uh, time could only

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.380
 heal it. It does stink, and it is hard and is difficult, and you don't

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.520
 you don't place parameters around what they're going through. But

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.660
 to understand that time will heal
