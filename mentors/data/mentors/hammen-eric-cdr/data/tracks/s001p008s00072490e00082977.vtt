00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.260
uh, one story I can think of that really kind of capsule. It's what I

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:11.660
 do and why I do. What I do is, uh, one specific time. I remember, um,

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.070
 while to play with the Marines in Afghanistan. Um, I have an opportunity

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.470
 to lead worship and to also, um, offer what we would call the

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.880
 Lords Lords prayer. And in a church, it's very formal with with gold

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.290
 plates and very reverent. But this particular opportunity was with

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.690
 Marines coming off of the battlefield. And as we pass around ah ah,

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.100
 makeshift plate with with bread broken up, tow watch and to observe,

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.500
 um, greasy and or bloody hands from individuals just coming back from

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.910
 air wing and from combat and dealing with death and toil and disruption.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.310
 And to have an opportunity Thio have community together was

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.720
 really and really personal and something that I'll never forget
