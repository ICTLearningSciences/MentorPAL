00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.110
you know, it is very common for an individual to start down one path and

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.360
 maybe fail or voluntarily step out of it. And so it depends on on

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.620
 the career that they're looking into it. If you're trying to get into

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.870
 buds, for instance, many times they ask for an alternate rate that

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.130
 you may want to go into in case, um, that does not work for you. But

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.390
 I found that even in my own career, starting off of the radium in

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.640
 which converted to an I. T. I, I transferred over to legal men when

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.900
 my interest changed, and now I'm a chaplain. So I think there's many

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.150
 different pathways. One end of one pathway does not mean failure.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.410
 It just means that opportunity for a new pathway.
