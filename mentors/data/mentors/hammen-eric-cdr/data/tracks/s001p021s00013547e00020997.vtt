00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.680
So I think chaplains are a unique designator because many chaplains who

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.520
 come in are maybe a little bit older because they realized they want

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.350
 to serve at older Date. So really, the youngest ah, person could

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.180
 be as a chaplain if they wanted to be a chaplain. Since age 18 is around

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.020
 26 or 27 um, with all the qualifications. So there are some provisions

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.850
 for the people who are even over 60 to get waivers to continue

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.680
 on active duty. Um, but it really depends on the needs of the navy

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.520
 and where they're stationed, and the bill is that they're feeling.
