00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.150
yes, So each person in the chain of command or at a command has different

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.450
 roles. When dealing with the sexual assault you have your victim

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.750
 advocate is there primarily for the victim. Um, they're they're going

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.060
 to see everything from their point of view. You have a chaplain who

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.360
 has is a unequal footing, has has an opportunity. Thio listen to

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.660
 advise based on 100% confidentiality. There's no risk of it going up

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.960
 the chain of command or to anybody else, because the confidence really

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.260
 lies in the person telling you, have your command who has to who

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.560
 is responsible for making sure that the victim and the accused is taking

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.860
 care of fairly and that there is a process put in place and then

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.160
 you have outside Fleet and family who have array of resource is that

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.470
 can support both individuals with counseling with advocacy and different

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.770
 avenues to that. So there's really is limit list, but each

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.070
 of them have different roles and what they can and cannot report. But

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.370
 the understanding those is important
