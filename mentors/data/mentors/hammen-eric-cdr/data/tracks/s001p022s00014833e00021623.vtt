So I think on most ships, dating is is frowned upon by the leaders. Unless

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.820
 it's somebody off the ship that you're seeing now, especially as

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.810
 a leader, it is increases the complications because now you're looked

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.790
 at and there could be, um, appearance off view, treating somebody

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.780
 more favorably because you're dating them or they're a friend of someone

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.760
 you're dating, so it creates another complication upon that.
