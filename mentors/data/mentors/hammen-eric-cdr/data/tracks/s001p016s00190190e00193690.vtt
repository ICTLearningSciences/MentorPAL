00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.740
so we all get assignments and they're called orders for a reason because

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.630
 we're ordered to go to that place or that location. So what we tell

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.520
 in our community a lot is the bloom where you're planted. There is

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.410
 no bad job that it's only Ah, bad attitude going into that job. And

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.290
 so there have been many times where I've been sent places where I

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.180
 thought that would not be a good fit for me. But it end up being a great

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.070
 experience. I end up making some very long lasting friendships,

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.960
 and it actually helped my career and brought me to where I'm at now.
