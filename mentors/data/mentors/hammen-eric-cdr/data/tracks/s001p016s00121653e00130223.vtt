00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.660
one of the strategies I used to handle fatigue is making sure I get a

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.470
 good night's sleep. I know it's a very common statement, but people

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.280
 not necessarily don't know how to do it. Make sure that the room is

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.080
 is dark and maybe a little bit cool, making sure there's no blue lights

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.890
 that your phone is. Is your turned off or turned upside down? Or

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.700
 that there's no lights coming in that you have the same pattern? That

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.510
 may be at a certain time. You You take a shower before you go to

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.320
 sleep and allows your your body thio start to shut down for the evening

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.130
 and that you're not looking at your phone or any kind of screen,

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.930
 Uh, almost an hour before you go to bed. Those types of strategies

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.740
 really can can really help you get back into a good sleep cycle, making

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.550
 you able to handle fatigue and stress at work
