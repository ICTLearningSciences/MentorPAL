00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.780
I think every command has a list of either collateral duties or jobs that

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.700
 may be coming available at the command, and I think that's key to

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.630
 to be in communication with that. If it's something a new role that

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.550
 you potentially may qualify for at the command basis, apply for it.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.480
 If it's something outside the command, something that comes out Navy

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.400
 messaging sometimes sends out things. For instance, there's a message

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.330
 looking for, um, interns working for the justice system up in D.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.250
 C. If that seems to something that you would fit, you can apply for

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.180
 those types of things talking your chain of command, getting that

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.100
 sometimes you look for foreign service officers, maybe you speak a different

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.030
 language, and that's something that you'd be interested in.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.950
 So you would again just go through the channels that air within the

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.880
 Navy message and apply for those opportunities
