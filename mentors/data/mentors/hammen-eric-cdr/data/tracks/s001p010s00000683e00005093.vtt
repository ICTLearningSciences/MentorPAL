00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.750
my ideal team would be filled with members with different skill sets,

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.650
 since I am much more of a visionary and I would definitely want to have

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.550
 people who are detail oriented, Uh, people who are gonna also be

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.450
 not be not afraid to tell me if something's wrong to speak out a two

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.350
 first sign of something that was incorrect. And so ultimately, I just

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.250
 want a team that is gonna come together at whole even though we're

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.150
 not all the same. Maybe we're all we have different personalities,

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.050
 which is fine, but somebody that we're gonna complement each other

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.950
 and make each other better.
