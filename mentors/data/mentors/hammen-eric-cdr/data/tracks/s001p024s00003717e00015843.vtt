00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.130
so different types of assault. There are different reporting factor is

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.400
 a restricted and unrestricted. Both have, um, different circumstances.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.680
 So restricted, uh, report is one report that you would submit that

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.960
 nobody knows Thea events that took place. I'm not sure if it's just

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.230
 the commanding officer, you may be aware, but what it does do is

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.510
 it allows all of the evidence to be collected all the different specimens

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.790
 unfortunate nous happened, but to not be reported upon a chain

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.060
 of command, The unrestricted is you report it, they collect all the

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.340
 evidence and it goes up the chain of command not necessarily your immediate

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.620
 chain of command, but for the people who can address the sexual

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.900
 assault Now, if you report to a chaplain, it doesn't matter if

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.170
 it's restricted or unrestricted, because they have confidence and they

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.450
 will not report it for either way. So it's a safe haven there. I

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.730
 will say that if you report to certain individuals like if you report

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.000
 to ah hospital out in town, you no longer can have a restricted because

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.280
 they're bound by different laws than in the military. So there

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.560
 is a little bit of nuance and complications, but in essence is who

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.830
 sees the reports knowing that you go and get help. Either way is what's

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.110
 important.
