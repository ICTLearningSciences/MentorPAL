WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.640
was my first tour of Afghanistan. There was a group of Marines who were

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.430
 the reservists from the middle of America. They were assigned as generated

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.220
 mechanics and different jobs, and and they got placed in a

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.010
 unit that was responsible for collecting. Uh, they're dead comrades

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.800
 their body parts and then do inventories and place them on a plane back

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.590
 to Dover to their family members. Ah, very difficult thing that

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.380
 they were not expecting to do. They did not have the training for but

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.170
 to understand that they were part of something much bigger, something

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.960
 that was going to be, uh, fruitful for the whole unit fruitful for

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.750
 the families.
