00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.370
so breaking the rules is a non honor, courage and commitment mentality

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.880
 is is never really okay. And if if we're talking about semantics, if

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.400
 someone's life is in danger and a rule maybe needs to be broken to

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.910
 save the individual's life, and I don't mean just life and death but

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.430
 altering the course of their existence, so to speak, whether it's

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.940
 a relationship doing the right thing is never is never really wrong.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.460
 But we have to understand that even if we break the rules for the right

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.970
 thing, that there may be consequences. But doing the right thing

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.490
 should outweigh those consequences.
