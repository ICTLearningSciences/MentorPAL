I think the best strategy for enlisted or officer and setting goals and

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.620
 priorities is to really look at your commander's intent. Every commander

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.000
 has a list of priorities that they have, and so they list those

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.390
 priorities, and it's it's really your job as a leader and as a follower,

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.770
 too. Really grasp those priorities and see where you fit in

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.150
 those points when you write your evil or fit rep, you write how you

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.540
 met those priorities, and I think that's really your best, um, case

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.920
 to advancement in your best opportunity.
