00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.570
So when I was stationed at Naval Special Warfare, an opportunity to be,

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.280
 uh, chaplain for one of the specific teams, and so that entailed me

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.000
 doing work ups with them, deploying with them and then coming back

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.710
 and doing the return of the union with the teams and being embedded

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.430
 with them was key because it wasn't just the chaplain making a visit

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.140
 in Afghanistan for a couple of days. But it was the chaplain that

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.860
 was serving with them that was living with them that was training with

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.570
 them. And I think it really paid dividends and gave an opportunity

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.290
 for some real ministry to happen. And it was a blessing to see how

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.000
 they grew into the opportunity of having someone with them to provide

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.720
 those specific skill sets.
