I think one way, uh, that you can develop skills within a team is to observe

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.560
 the other teammates within that team. The find out where their

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.410
 strengths and deficiencies are. And how do you assimilate your own

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.270
 personality? How do you assimilate your own strength and weaknesses

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.120
 and how that's going to contribute? Um, to the team ahead. Sometimes

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.970
 that's gonna be require some additional training. Additional guideline.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.830
 Whether that's formal training, informal on the job. The ultimate

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.680
 goal is that when we look around the team that we have people that

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.540
 are complementary to one another and they're able to get the mission

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.390
 done.
