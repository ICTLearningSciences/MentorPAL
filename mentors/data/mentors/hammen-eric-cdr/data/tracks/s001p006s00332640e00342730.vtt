I think leadership is something that you never lose. Um, you can't delegate

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.220
 necessarily the responsibility because as the leader, you bear

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.900
 that responsibility. But what you can delegate is the opportunity for

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.590
 them to showcase their skills and their opportunities to become a

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.270
 leader in the future. And so with that, they get that opportunity to

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.960
 to showcase that while you are still in the responsibility seat for

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.640
 any mistakes because you're gonna give them permission to make mistakes

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.330
 and to learn and to, um, kind of round those rough edges that

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.010
 they have in their lives and then come alongside in private and to correct

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.700
 and to shape and to mold Ah, that individual. So I think the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.380
 leadership is continuous from the one up Thio um, the highest admiral

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.070
 in the fleet. I think we have all have those roles. We all have individuals

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.750
 that are looking to us as leaders
