00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.630
so putting in a plan in place for someone who's contemplating suicide.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.410
 Um, in the past, they would. There was contracts that were being made

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.190
 between the individual who was contemplating suicide and the person

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.970
 that was necessary counseling with him. But really, what it comes

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.760
 down to is is having more than one resource for them. Um, there is

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.540
 always a national suicide hotline, and depending on the location you're

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.320
 at or a regional area, that could be 1 24 hour number that they

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.100
 could call. Um, the chain of command should be one, and I would always

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.880
 recommend a friend or somebody close to them. A family member should

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.660
 be on that list, but making sure that's just not one number that

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.440
 they have or one resource. And to have two or three, maybe if it's

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.220
 if it's on a corridor. If I were counseling that individual toe, maybe

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.000
 I take their phone and ask them for their phone and and place my

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.790
 number in there specifically, eso. I know that they have that resource,

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.570
 and then if they can't get a hold of me to give them an alternate

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.350
 place, I think that's key because many times. It's just the person

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.130
 to talk Thio an individual to connect with that's gonna help them cope

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.910
 with that.
