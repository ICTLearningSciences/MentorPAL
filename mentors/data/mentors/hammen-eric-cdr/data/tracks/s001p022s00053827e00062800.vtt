 person who's being abused by it, but it really undermines all the

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.450
 people in that workspace. And sometimes it could even affect, um, their

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.980

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.060
 spread around an entire division or department toe, undermine that

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.580
 leadership.
