00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.830
So I think there's many ways that you can do to improve your skills. Um,

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.810
 you should. You should be a forever learner. Everywhere you go, you

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.790
 should always want Thio increase. You should be reading a ZMA each

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.770
 as you possibly can, But there's always opportunities, uh, for extra

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.750
 schooling, whether it's civilian, whether it's military with JPM

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.730
 me or going upto postgraduate school or taking a spot at Monterey Toe.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.720
 Learn something new. So there's opportunities. I think for everyone

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.700
 enlisted has opportunities for different certifications. You could

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.680
 even get a certification and coaching and being a life coach. And

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.660
 so I think, the limit its limitless out there even as far as taking

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.640
 a civilian school, Um, many times the G I bill will cover those opportunities

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.620
 also.
