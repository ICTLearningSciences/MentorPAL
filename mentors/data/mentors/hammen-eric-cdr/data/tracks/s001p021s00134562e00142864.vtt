00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.760
I think with all things being equal, I think the best way to do it is

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.670
 to go to college earlier than later. Um, there's nothing wrong with

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.580
 going to college later. And in fact, sometimes your experience and the

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.490
 things you have gone through makes you appreciate it more. But I

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.400
 think going to college earlier sometimes limits maybe the other things,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.320
 that responsibility that you may have later in life. For instance,

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.230
 I went to college and I had Children. I went to college. I had two

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.140
 Children at the time, and I went to graduate school. Had four Children

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.050
 at the time, so the responsibility was greater is a little more

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.960
 difficult, but it also gave me a different view of how I how I learned

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.870
 and the importance I put upon it.
