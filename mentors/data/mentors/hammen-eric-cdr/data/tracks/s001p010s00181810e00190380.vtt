00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.420
in order to get to know your bosses. I think it takes time. And I think

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.990
 it takes perseverance and opportunistic when the boss offers ah chance

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.560
 to get together or a boss offers a chance to, um, fellowship, you

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.130
 take advantage of it and the same principles I would use and counseling

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.700
 is is I would ask questions and listen. Listen to what my boss

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.270
 is intent or listen. Two of my boss boss's priorities are. And then

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.840
 as I'm doing my work, as I'm trying to meet deadlines and trying to

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.410
 take care of what his intent is, I have all of this background and

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.980
 I can think like he thinks, and that would be one way that I would

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.550
 do to get to know the individual.
