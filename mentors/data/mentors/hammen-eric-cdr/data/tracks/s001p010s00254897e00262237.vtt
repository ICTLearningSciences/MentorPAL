00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.620
You know, one experience I remember distinctly is being on a ship coming

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.390
 up in the dark. All the red lights are on and coming out onto the

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.160
 fantail and the dark and the stars and or even waking up in the morning

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.940
 on that ship, standing on that flight deck, looking down at the

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.710
 water and watching the dolphins keep pace with ship, almost as it's

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.480
 pretty protecting us or speaking to us and leading us into where we're

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.250
 trying to go.
