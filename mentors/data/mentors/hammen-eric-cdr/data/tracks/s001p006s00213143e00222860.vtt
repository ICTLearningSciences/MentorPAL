00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.050
throughout my extended career of 28 years, I had to relocate many times.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:11.240
 It seems I started off on the East Coast. Um, immediately, I went

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.440
 overseas to Roosevelt Roads. Puerto Rico brought my wife with me there.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.640
 From there, I came back to the East Coast, which became a theme

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.840
 or a jumping point. I then relocated to New Orleans. Louisiana came

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.030
 back to the East Coast to the no folk Hampton Roads area. From there,

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:37.230
 I went down to, um, South Carolina for Jackson and again, back to

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.430
 the East Coast of Notebook. Been down in Camp Lejeune, North Carolina,

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.630
 Cherry Point Area and back to, um, the Norfolk area. Now I'm a geo

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.820
 bachelor where I travel up to the Pentagon during the week, and my

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.020
 family is still located in the Virginia Beach area.
