00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.240
so as a leader respond to in death on a ship, you have to understand that

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.630
 everybody deals with it differently. This might be the first time

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.020
 that they knew an individual who died. This could be something that

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.410
 is very familiar to them, so to understand and to give opportunities

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.810
 for people to mourn differently and to not place your own preconceptions

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.200
 on how they should mourn on them, I think is key. Giving them

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.590
 resource is giving them time, if appropriate, and then trying to get

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.980
 back to normal as soon as you can help heal those situations.
