00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.560
so being being a chaplain, we are an individual who, unfortunately, it

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.280
 has to do death notifications. And throughout my career is a chaplain.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.990
 I've I've dealt with multiple suicides, um, somewhere people that

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.700
 maybe run into on occasion or maybe even spoke to once or twice and

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.420
 somewhere, maybe just members of the command that I didn't know or

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.130
 a sister command that I had to be involved with. One time an individual

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.840
 who was having suicidal ideations tried to call me, um, to talk.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.560
 But I was in a location where I did not get reception and the individual

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.270
 ended up taking his life death by suicide, Not necessarily because

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.980
 they couldn't get ahold of me because there was this other issues.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.700
 But it's still affected me greatly and the importance of having

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.410
 backups, the people you could talk to
