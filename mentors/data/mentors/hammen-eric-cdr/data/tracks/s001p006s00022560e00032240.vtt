00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.910
so as the department had your your day never really ends and you wake

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.960
 up and you're making sure that your people are taken care of, that they

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.020
 have all the material that they need to accomplish the task that

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.080
 you may have given them. But I think it goes beyond that. I think it

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.140
 goes on to the fact where you want to find out more about those individuals,

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.190
 that you want to see, what makes them tick and maybe some

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.250
 things that are stopping them from accomplishing the goals that they

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.310
 have. Because ultimately, as department, you're responsible for the

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.360
 divisions under you and all the personnel, and we want to have the

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.420
 same mission accomplished. We all want to meet the commander's intent

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.480
 and his priorities or her priorities. And so we are really the stopper

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.540
 and the gap in the filter from the higher ups and were pushing

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.590
 information down. But we're also taking information from the junior

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.650
 sailors and pushing it up to the chain of command
