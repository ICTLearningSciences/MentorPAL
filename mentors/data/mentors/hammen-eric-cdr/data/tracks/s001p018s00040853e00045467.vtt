00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.700
I think each location has a different waitlist than on and off base, and

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.540
 I assume it's really depicted by what is the cost of living out in

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.390
 the community. So if you're going to ah, San Diego or ah, place where

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.230
 it might be more expensive, I think the housing is going to be a

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.080
 lot more coveted because people can't afford it. So I think early on,

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.920
 as soon as you get your orders, your hard copy of orders is the first

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.770
 time you need to communicate with the housing office and whether

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.610
 or not you're gonna live on base. I think that's key because it puts

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.460
 your name high on the list. So when the opportunity comes and when

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.300
 you do get to your location, you will be higher on that list or you

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.150
 can take yourself off if you choose to live out in the community.
