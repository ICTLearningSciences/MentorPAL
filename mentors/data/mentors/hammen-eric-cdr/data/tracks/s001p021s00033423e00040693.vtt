00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.480
I think the some of the most important things that can be listed on your

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.120
 resume is his leadership potential things that you have done, whether

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.750
 it's whether it's your bio, your resume within the military or

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.380
 out in the civilian world. Thio bail for the person who is interviewing

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.020
 me, you or observing, you are sitting on your board to see your

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.650
 potential. The things that you have done, Um, and the sky's the limit

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.280
 there. I think if you write things down on your resume that just show

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.920
 menial tasks that you have accomplished doesn't show that to your

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.550
 potential.
