00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.390
some of the physical environments in which I worked at, um can be anywhere

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.940
 from an administrative office type environment. Thio. One of that

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.480
 would be a field environment with Second Marine Aircraft Wing, where

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.030
 your commands are spread out and you have to put boots on the ground

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.570
 and to visit your people and to take care of your commanders all

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.120
 the way to special forces, where you have a much more relaxed environment

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.660
 but still just as professional as any of the others. And to

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.210
 a ship where everybody is contained on one vessel and they can't go

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.750
 anywhere, so tracking them down is much easier.
