00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.250
so leading a group discussion after death really depends on how close

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.650
 the individuals were, um, to the situation. Sometimes it might be just

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.050
 opening up the floor and allowing them to share their feelings, uh,

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.450
 to not let it get off track. And but still, to make it opportunity

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.850
 to be therapeutic for them, Thio really understand. Maybe, uh, misspell

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.240
 some of the common misconceptions, um, with suicide or whichever

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.640
 way that they death died? Um, those air those strategies that can

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.040
 be used, But it's really mawr of opening up a forum, making it a safe

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.440
 place to talk and allowing people to really share their own experiences.
