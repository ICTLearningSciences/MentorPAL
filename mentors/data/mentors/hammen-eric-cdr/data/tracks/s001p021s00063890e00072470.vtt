00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.670
So I've been blessed to have at least somebody at every command that I

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.480
 can tow, lean into whether it was N. C. One on a ship or whether it's

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.300
 just my direct supervisor as a chaplain. But I try to surround myself

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.120
 with people who I respect. Maybe they are not like me. Maybe they're

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.930
 different denomination or ethnicity, or they have different beliefs

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.750
 or thoughts. But I respect them for their accomplishments and

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.570
 the things they do. So it really depends on where I'm stationed, because

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.380
 along the lines of somebody who wants to support you, there are

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.200
 always people who are going to doubt you and say that you can't do

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.020
 it or giving excuse why. So you have to have discernment and who you're

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.830
 talking thio and understand. Those are the people that you want

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.650
 to follow.
