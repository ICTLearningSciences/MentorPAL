I think one service that is almost never, at least in the Conus or the

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.630
 United States found, is our our public schools. Within. There are a

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.020
 few bases that have middle schools, elementary schools and high schools

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.420
 on the base I can think of in Camp Lejeune, but typically it's

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.810
 on Lee overseas and that that would be very uncommon if you went to

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.200
 Ah place and they had a school system on the base for your kids to go

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.590
