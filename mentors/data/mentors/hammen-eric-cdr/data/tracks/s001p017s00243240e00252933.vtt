00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.230
Yes. So good plan toe have in place in case there's an emergency, which

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.610
 the definition of emergency is. You're not expecting it, but one instances,

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.990
 I was deployed. I fact, I went with the Marines over to Afghanistan,

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.370
 and about three weeks into my deployment, hurricane came

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.750
 down the East Coast, where they had to evacuate everybody in that location.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.130
 So the plan we had in place was having some readily funds available,

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.500
 some cash, um, that my wife could take in case the banks and

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.880
 the A T. M's were down. And we were able to use that cash to get a

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.260
 hotel room, and she was able to go far enough away with the plans that

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.640
 we've already established, um, to take care of that emergency. So

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.020
 really having a contingency plan, having some resource is available

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.400
 in case even a natural disaster happens. And I think that's the best

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.780
 way that you could go for planning for an emergency
