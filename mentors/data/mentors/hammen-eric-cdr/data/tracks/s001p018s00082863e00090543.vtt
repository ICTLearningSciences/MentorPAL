00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.940
you know, while unemployment, there's many different options nowadays.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.030
 When I joined in 92 my active communication was writing letters and

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.120
 numbering them to make sure they got there in sequence. Um, but since

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.210
 the last time when I went to Afghanistan, we actually had WiFi in

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.290
 Afghanistan village where people could Skype at home and talk to her

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.380
 family in real time. So it depends on your circumstance in your situation,

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.470
 whether you are in a place where maybe they cut the Internet

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.560
 down for security reasons, but mostly you'll have opportunities to

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.650
 use technology to communicate with your loved ones.
