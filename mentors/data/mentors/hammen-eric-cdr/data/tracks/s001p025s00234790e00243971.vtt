00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.170
so as a chaplain like any other, um, designator in the Navy, your job.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.480
 You have training that deals with what you do, and unfortunately, we

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.800
 do deal with death on a somewhat regular basis. So there are some

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.120
 formal trainings that we go through, whether it's through our seminary,

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.440
 whether it's Keiko training, which is casualty assist, uh, officer

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.750
 training, whether it's going to the mortuary affairs training that

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.070
 we have, or just plain experience dealing with it on a regular basis.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.390
 All those kind of play a factor on how each individual chaplain

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.710
 deals with death, how they do notifications, how to deal with it personally

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.020
 within your own self. And then you also have to throw in the

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.340
 mix of their faith, background and what death means in their faith,

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.660
 background and the circumstances surrounding
