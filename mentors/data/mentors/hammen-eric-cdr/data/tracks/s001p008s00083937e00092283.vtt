00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.680
a good time to see a chaplain is any time were available 24 hours today.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.510
 I've I've received, um, some phone calls late at night. Maybe even

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.340
 individual is impaired or unable toe. Clearly speak where we could

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.170
 hopefully have a short chat and then talk later when the individual

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.990
 is sober. But really the right time to talk to a chaplain is is the

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.820
 time of need. Um, I think if you push it off, sometimes circumstances

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.650
 enter into your life and you may forget or suppress that that feeling,

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.480
 but it really doesn't do you any good, But so the best time to

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.310
 talk to a chaplain is is when the need is there.
