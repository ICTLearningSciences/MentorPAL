00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.100
my family was unlike, uh, other families in the area. We had a mom and

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.350
 a dad who loved me very much and are still together, and it's still

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.600
 alive. They're both from different countries. So the only thing different

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.860
 that I had was maybe the food on her table. My brothers were

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.110
 typical older brothers. Nice to me when it benefited them, but mostly

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.360
 I was there bully or the one that they could take advantage of. They

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.610
 were a little bit older than I was. Um, eso I spent most of my time

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.860
 as an only child because they were either in college or out of the

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.110
 house. I had friends that I grew up with, um, pretty much my entire

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.370
 life, the same group of friends, but as far as my family, a lot of

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.620
 families from my father's side, um, there many cousins that I got Thio

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.870
 to play with and hang out with and go to different family events
