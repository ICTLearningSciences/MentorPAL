00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.010
I think some good strategies for your presence is being consistent with

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.160
 your personality. I think as you look at leaders, even bad leaders

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.320
 and good leaders, if you have somebody who is inconsistent, that you

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.480
 don't know which person is going to be there to greet you that day,

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.640
 that is the most worst environment you could be in so consistency.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.790
 Whether if you're a harsh leader or somebody who is a little bit more

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.950
 firm, the consistency matters and the same thing. If you're ah, more

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.110
 laid back or relaxed leader, I think it's something that they're

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.270
 going to expect when they come into a situation as they meet your intent,

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.420
 they're going to know how to approach you, and so I think that

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.580
 is probably the most important characteristic.
