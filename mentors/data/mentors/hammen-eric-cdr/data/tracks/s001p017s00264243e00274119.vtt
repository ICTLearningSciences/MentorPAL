00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.050
I think one of the big secrets in the military of being content and being

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.240
 happy is realistic expectations. I know it sounds very boring, but

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.440
 if we go into a situation understanding, um, the intent of what it

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.640
 is, I think it gives us a frame of mind and allows us to really not

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.840
 to have ah pie in the sky type of dream, but to have a realistic expectation.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.030
 And then when things go better than normal, you could be

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.230
 pleasantly surprised. But understand that you're you're serving your

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.430
 country, that there's a reason why we all raise our hand and and signed

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.620
 up to do this voluntarily. And so I think the satisfaction of

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.820
 that needs to be where we start and set our bar and to understand anything

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.020
 above that, all the benefits that come with the military, whether

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.220
 it's pay, whether it's, ah, the G I, Bill or V a loan are all really

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.410
 just that they're just benefits of something that we really were

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.610
 going to do anyways.
