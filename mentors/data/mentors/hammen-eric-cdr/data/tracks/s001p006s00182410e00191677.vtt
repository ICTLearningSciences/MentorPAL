00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.240
some of the common misconceptions about our field is one is that all chaplains

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.630
 are the same that we all do believe the same thing but actuality.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.020
 We all come from our own faith backgrounds and were given permission

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.410
 to act as such and act within our faith backgrounds. Another

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.800
 misconception is that all we do is walk around and and talk to people

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.190
 and a bearer of good news when the truth of the matter is that were

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.570
 many times in places of of despair and places, of hurt and confusion.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.960
 And we are brought into that a real level because we're stationed

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.350
 with them and sometimes deployed with them doing life with them,

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.740
 and it could take a real toll on individual both them as they're presenting

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.130
 the information. But to us is as chaplains who are carrying

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.520
 it all with us.
