00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.970
So I think people react differently to suicide. And when a reaction is

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.100
 good riddance or I'm glad they did, it is many times is they're uncomfortable

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.220
 with death themselves. Or maybe they've had a loved one or

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.350
 somebody else that they know who had died by suicide. And so it's

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.470
 really a reaction to get past it and not have to deal with it. So allowing

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.590
 them toe have their thoughts and and cope with it and their situation,

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.720
 and maybe some education might get them along and see the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.840
 rial seriousness of it.
