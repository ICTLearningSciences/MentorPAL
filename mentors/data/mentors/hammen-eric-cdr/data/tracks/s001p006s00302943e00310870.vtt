I think a common mistake that a leader can make is to come into the organization

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.670
 or into the position and immediately change everything to

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.580
 throw, um, the baby out with the bathwater, Uh, just to put a finger

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.480
 print or a stamp of their style in the situation. I think what that

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.390
 does is it makes everybody else feel inadequate or that everything

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.300
 they have done in the past was not useful or good, and it really sets

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.210
 them up for failure. And for those individuals, Thio not trust you

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.120
 as a leader and not think that you value their opinion.
