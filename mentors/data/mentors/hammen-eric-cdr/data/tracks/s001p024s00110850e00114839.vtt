You know, one way Thio avoid bias when evaluating sailors is is looking

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.830
 at their record for what it is. What I mean by that is, um, many times

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.820
 when you're even doing evils and or if you're a board member looking

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.810
 at evils, you don't see a picture. You don't see an individual

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.790
 race, creed, religion. You see their accomplishments and what they've

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.780
 done. And so if you can train yourself is as you're evaluating, despite

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.770
 if that person has the same interests as you or come from the

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.760
 same background as you as you. If you were to evaluate on their Onley

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.750
 on their accomplishments and their potential, I think then you can

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.740
 avoid some biases in the future.
