00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.170
I think some counseling skills or characteristics that are really important

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.490
 specifically is be a good listener, being someone who is not necessary

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.810
 just quick to spout off with a response before you truly understand.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.130
 And then when you're counseling somebody, or when you're dialoguing

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.450
 with that individual, to maybe repeat what you think that

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.770
 individual means. So you're on the same page and you're clear with their

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.090
 intent. But I think definitely listening more than speaking is

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.410
 the most important of the characteristics.
