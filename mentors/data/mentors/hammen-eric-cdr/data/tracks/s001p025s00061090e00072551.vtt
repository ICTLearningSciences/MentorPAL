00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.000
so having thoughts of suicide is very common. It's its's ridiculous almost

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.140
 to tell somebody to stop thinking about suicide. Um, but some of

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.290
 the ways that you can do is is to make sure that you're talking to

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.430
 individual. And so, um, if you were taking a trip to Australia and

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.580
 didn't have ah passport or a plane ticket, I would probably think that

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.720
 you're not serious. And just like, if you're talking about suicide

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.870
 and you really don't know, um, you need to listen to that person and

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.010
 think. But if they have a plan in place and they have a place, that

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.160
 they're gonna do this, it's a very serious thing that you need to

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.300
 address, but really just taking everything seriously, taking everything

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.450
 as it's important to that individual not downplaying any of their

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.590
 experiences or any any of their loss that they had that's making

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.740
 them feel this way. Making sure that they have the resource is that

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.880
 they need that they have an individual that they can contact at any

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.030
 point of the day, whether that's yourself, whether that's a family member

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.170
 or a friend, whether that's a chaplain or ah, social worker. But

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.320
 having numbers that they can contact whenever they're on their lowest

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.460
 point, contemplating suicide is going to be key
