00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.180
I think having a support system back in the States is something that you

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.520
 really need to get ready before going overseas. I think a lot of

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.850
 things happen that you may have to keep a car back or have AH rental

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.180
 place that you can't sell before you go overseas. So having that support

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.510
 system, whether it's family, whether it's ah, Realtor, whether

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.850
 it's ah storage facility, all those places and things really will be

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.180
 integral before you head overseas.
