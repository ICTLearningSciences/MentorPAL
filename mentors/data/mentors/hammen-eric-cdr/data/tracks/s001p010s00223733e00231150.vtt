00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.120
I think managing military people as opposed civilians really comes down

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.390
 to accountability. Military members have a different set of accountability.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.660
 They have the U C M J that they have to follow, and they have

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.940
 rules and regulation where civilians are a little bit loosely based

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.210
 on that, there are rules and regulations on how to discipline a

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.480
 civilian member. How to even fire or terminate a civilian member is

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.750
 different than one of a military individual. And so I think the accountability

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.020
 piece really plays a role in that supervision.
