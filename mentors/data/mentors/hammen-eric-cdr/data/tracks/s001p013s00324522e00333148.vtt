Wow, it z never easy to have to be the bearer of bad news and it Z it's

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.130
 necessary. But I think that the best piece of advice I can give is

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.270
 be clear and be honest and only tell them what what you know. Don't

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.410
 speculate. Don't try to tell them that it's gonna be all right. And

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.550
 don't tell them that it's all gonna be over. You want to just you sit

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.690
 with them, you give them the news, you allow them to marinate in

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.830
 that moment of time and you just be there with them, you'd be still

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.970
 and you allow that time, even though it may be uncomfortable to really

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.110
 allow them to focus and to grasp what news you just gave them.
