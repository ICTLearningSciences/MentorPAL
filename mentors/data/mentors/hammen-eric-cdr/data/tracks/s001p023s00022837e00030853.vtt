00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.870
I think one of the most important lessons about life is is to stop and

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.880
 just be. So look around at the circumstances that God has given you,

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.900
 whether it's at a duty station at, ah, place that you would never

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.910
 have visited before. If you're a civilian, whether even if Zahhar decor

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.930
 Ah, problem that you're having with your family. But to savor every

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.950
 moment that you have in life because life is a vapor and before

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.960
 you know it, you're going to be at the end of your career. You're gonna

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.980
 be at the end of whatever you're trying to dio, and you're gonna

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.990
 look back and for what? And so to sit back and enjoy what you're going

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.010
 through at that moment.
