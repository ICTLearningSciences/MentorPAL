00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.670
as the supervisor myself, I think feedback is extremely important. So

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.490
 if I were in a situation where my direct supervisor was not giving me

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.310
 that feedback, I would attempt to schedule a non opportunity to get

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:20.130
 their opinion. I think most leaders, especially senior leaders, are

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.960
 not short of opinions. And if you can play to that aspect in your

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.780
 life and just share and be transparent, say I really covet and appreciate

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.600
 any kind of guidance you can give me, I think you will get that

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.420
 either in a formal or informal fashion to help meet those needs.
