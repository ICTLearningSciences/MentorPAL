00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.180
so I don't think you should deal with the misconduct issue at the lowest

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.500
 level when we're talking about items that are going to either hurt

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.830
 the individual, hurt others or have, ah, wide, um, swath of effect

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.150
 on a division or the department. You know, one of the resource is you

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.470
 can actually go to if it's more difficult to give up the chain of

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.800
 command is to talk to your chaplain. And ironically, I cannot divulge

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.130
 that information as a chaplain because of the confidentiality that

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.450
 which I hold. But there are opportunities for me to help the situation

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.780
 and find resource is and and things that will help defuse the situation

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.100
 and get to the results that are needed.
