00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.160
You know, there are a few options when we're talking about changing a

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.470
 job that you're unable to complete, whether it's because of a family

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.770
 emergency or even sometimes personality. But there are rules and regulations

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.080
 as faras time on station. If it's overseas, it's it's much

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.390
 more difficult, but there is always a way out with humanitarian transfer.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.700
 Um, sometimes we're dealing with a family situation and potentially

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.000
 ah, separation from your spouse, um, legal, or just something

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.310
 that you've both agreed upon. I believe that if you are speaking and

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.620
 communicating with your your detailer or the individual, that is,

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.930
 um, in Millington for you. Sometimes they can work other things out.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.230
 Thio even transfer you at no cost, depending on the location. So I

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.540
 think communication is important to talk to that your supervisors and

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.850
 making sure they understand the situation
