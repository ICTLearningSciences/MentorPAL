00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.990
when they're tough circumstances coming up. I don't think it does anybody

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.120
 any good to sugar coat or to shield them from what is expected,

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.260
 I think laying out the good and the bad eyes important. I heard a story

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.400
 from a normal Gortney who talked about, um, aircraft when it comes

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.530
 in and as he's talking about junior officers flying the the F 18

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.670
 and he wants to know not just the capabilities, the positive capabilities

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.800
 of the aircraft, but whatever the negative things that we need

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.940
 to address. And so what we're doing is talking about something large

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.080
 inspections or some big task at hand. I think we need to know the

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.210
 shortcomings so we can address those honestly and get those up front.
