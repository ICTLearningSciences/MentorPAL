00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.590
My name is Eric Hammond. Um, currently a commander, Chaplain, station,

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.330
 Open up. Not working for a two star general, But my journey really

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.070
 began in 1992 when I enlisted from a small town in Wisconsin and attended

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.810
 boot camp in San Diego. And from there I was Ah, radioman. My

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.550
 first duty stations included commands such as LST Fairfax County, which

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.290
 is no longer around. I went to the U. S s Kidd, which is also decommissioned.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.030
 From there, I took a few different communication billets.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.770
 One took me to Roosevelt roads. Puerto Rico is no longer a Navy

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.510
 base. Also, around 2004 I felt a call into the ministry, and my enlisted

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.250
 career took me all way up to E six. And then I went over and commissioned

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.990
 as a chaplain candidate and finished my degrees and my graduate

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.740
 degree and became a chaplain. Tours is a chaplain. I started

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.480
 off going to Afghanistan with Second Marine Aircraft Wing, and immediately

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.220
 after that, I took a billet and deployed with ah seal team back

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.960
 to Afghanistan to very difficult and kinetic tours, where I learned

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.700
 a lot from there. I became an instructor for chaplains, and I was

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.440
 able to teach new chaplains and how to minister within the military.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.180
 From there, it took me to, ah, ship USS San Antonio lpd 17 and finally

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.920
 brought me to the Pentagon, where I'm currently at now. My family

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.660
 has always followed me. I've been married for 25 years. I have four

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.400
 Children from the ages of 24 to 15 and everywhere I've gone has been

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.140
 a challenge. But it's been an opportunity for them to grow and learn

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.880
 more about the Navy and how we support.
