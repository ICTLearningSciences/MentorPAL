I think, in enforcing honor codes and and allowing people to see the the

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.870
 importance of it. One way to do that, I think is is through history

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.380
 and to look at those who have gone before us and the successes that

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.890
 they had, the the the lay of the land that they are able to give

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.400
 us to the greatest generation and some of these historical films that

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.910
 are coming out midway in 1917. And to really see these heroes on live

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.420
 screen, I think that's a reminder of why we're fighting and why

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.930
 were honorable, even if other countries don't necessarily ascribed to

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.440
 the same characteristics.
