00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.650
I think if you do this career for any length of time, there's gonna be

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.460
 failures. I mean, we see that through, uh, inventors such as Edison

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.260
 and we see even see that in Scripture, as in King David with failure.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.060
 So I mean, people have to be judged not based on the one failure,

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.860
 but really the the totality of their circumstances and the efforts

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.670
 that they've put forth. So I think if everybody's honest and they can

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.470
 look inwardly, they know that they have failed at some point. So when

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.270
 someone alongside them fails, there should be more empathetic and

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.080
 understanding and ready to help that individual get back to success.
