00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.780
So if there's been a sexual assault reported and leadership does not seem

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.700
 to reacting, every victim will be assigned an advocate for them.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.630
 And I think that advocate is works outside the chain of command, even

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.560
 though they may be within that command and Kenbrell it to a different

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.490
 individual that potentially is not within the chain of command.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.410
 To help see this thing moved through the right channels and get addressed

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.340
 appropriately.
