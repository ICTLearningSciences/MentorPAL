00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.820
I've been told that as I went up in the ranks for people who knew me on

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.790
 do Know me that I haven't really changed. Uh, my style. In fact, recent

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.750
 stories. I was doing a change of command and a za chaplain. I'm

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.720
 up at the front stage, and I always look to the commanding officer

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.690
 who is the senior individual at the event to see what is going on and

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.660
 how I should react how I shall wear my cover, etcetera. The last

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.630
 time I was at a change of command, I was the senior guy, and I realized

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.600
 that everybody is looking at me to see how they are to manage how

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.560
 they are to wear their cover. And so that was a little awakening that

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.530
 people are looking to me. And I just realized that no matter where

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.500
 you're at, there's always somebody watching
