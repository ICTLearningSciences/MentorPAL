00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.010
you know, being a leader does give you some opportunity for a flexible

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.170
 work schedule, but it also gives you a burden of responsibility to

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.340
 want to be there for your individuals and the people that work for you.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.500
 So I believe good leaders will alter their work schedules in a more

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.660
 robust way. Where there, there someplace, maybe a little bit earlier,

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.820
 or some place a little bit later than the rest of their subordinates

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.990
 to model that leadership. And it's not an abusive situation where

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.150
 because their leaders, they take more time off.
