I think one of the greatest benefits the military is the vacation opportunities.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.670
 A za leader. It's a little bit more difficult because you

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.590
 want to make sure that your people are are taking the leave that they

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.500
 have, and sometimes they want to build up, but to encourage them

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.410
 toe to take some time off in between those long periods of work. But

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.320
 as far as a leader, I get a chance to take a vacation just like anybody

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.230
 else. It just have to be a little bit more conscious of who is

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.140
 going to be around and maybe the person, my deputy or somebody right

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.060
 under me, um, is going to be there while I'm gone in case there's any

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.970
 issues. But that opportunity to really sever your time from work

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.880
 and to really focus on your family is is key, and it actually pays dividends

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.790
 for the rest of the command.
