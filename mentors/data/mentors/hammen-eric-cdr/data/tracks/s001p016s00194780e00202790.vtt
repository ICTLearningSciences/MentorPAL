00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.870
 that can be unhealthy. But there's also many opportunities to

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.880
 reduce stress from working out, finding a consistent sleeping pattern.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.890
 There's usually multiple options for food. Um, that you can't eat

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.900
 some healthy foods and take care of that. And then there's opportunities

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.910
 to be with friends in tow. Relief stress that way, whether it's

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.920

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.940
 um, that is an opportunity for us to release stress in that manner

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.950
 to.
