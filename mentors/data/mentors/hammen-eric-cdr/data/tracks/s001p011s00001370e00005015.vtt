00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.900
you know, with morale, especially as a chaplain, a lot of times where

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.950
 the lightning rod, um, for which way it's going to go. So if we can,

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.000
 um, act in a positive way, since we're dealing with the situation ourselves

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.050
 with our own families, and so it's it's tempting to kind of

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.100
 get down. But we gotta have to put a good face on. We remind them of

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.150
 what we're doing is important again. We're not necessary telling them

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.200
 all the reasons we're staying longer. But I think with our attitudes,

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.250
 with our positivity and our transparency, I think that goes a

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.300
 long way with dealing with morale.
