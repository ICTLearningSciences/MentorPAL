I think anywhere where there's people, you're gonna have corruption, and

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.230
 you're gonna see crimes happening across the board. And I guess they

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.410
 really start very small level of dishonesty and maybe, um, of theft

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.600
 or stealing. And I'm not always talking about necessarily of equipment

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.790
 or goods. But there's crimes of stealing time, Um, and then being

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.970
 distracted on the job and doing different things that could be

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.160
 just did detrimental as somebody actually physically stealing something

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.350
 or an object from the workspace.
