00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.430
So when, when dealing with individuals who might be what we would call

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.000
 out of the fight because of sickness and and if you're a leader or

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.580
 coworker there, there are many different options. I mean, everybody

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.150
 in their life goes through some scenarios where they may not be an optimal

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.730
 health or maybe in a tough situation, even if it's not them.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.300
 And so to understand that and Thio maybe educate those around you and

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.880
 so to take care of the individual, making sure that they're getting

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.460
 what's needed. Because the reality is if we rush people back too soon

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.030
 and they're not ready to come back, they're just gonna they're gonna

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.610
 get back out of the fight. But if we could get up and round and

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.180
 and ready to go and and purely taking care of everything that they

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.760
 need to, they're gonna be another asset to the team. And then when they

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.330
 come back, maybe there's opportunities to give all those individuals

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.910
 who had to step up and maybe take some extra workload. Maybe they

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.480
 get a little bit of time off and an opportunity to kind of regroup

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.060
 themselves
