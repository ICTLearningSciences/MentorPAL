I think one thing that gets romanticized about my career field as a chaplain

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.020
 is that, well, one thing is that all we do is work on Sunday

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.600
 way. Just we get up in front of people. We walk around the spaces and

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.190
 and pass out candy and and where the nice guy everywhere we go. But

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.770
 in reality, um, it's much more than that because we're meeting people

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.360
 where they are. We're doing life with our our congregants, so to

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.940
 speak. So when bad things happen, we're in the midst of it. When good

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.530
 things happens, we get to share. But most most of the time, just

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.110
 as in human kind and has a Z, People go, we go also.
