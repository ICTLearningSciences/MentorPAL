So sometimes your parties will conflict with those of your management

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.810
 because, well, they have a different view and a different if they're

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.290
 at the strategic level and you're at the tactical. So there's been

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.770
 a time when I really needed to focus on the individuals at my command

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.250

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.120
 of doing a little bit of both and taking care of the people at my command,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.600
 but also intermittently helping the other people that need that

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.080
 my superiors wanted me to dio
