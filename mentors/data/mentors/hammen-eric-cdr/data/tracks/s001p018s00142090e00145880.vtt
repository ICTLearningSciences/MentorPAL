00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.060
I think one really main benefit, uh, that people don't take advantage

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.270
 of is really maxing them out there. TSP The TSP is I don't work for

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.480
 them. But it is probably by far the best investment that anybody can

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.690
 have, whether in military or in the civilian world, because of the

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.910
 cost and the matching. The second benefit I would like to have seen

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.120
 people use MAWR is their g i. Bill. Um, people say they enter the military

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.330
 to get college paid for, but many times they they don't and ends

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.540
 up going toe waste. So I suggest either use it, pass it on to your

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.750
 spouse or your Children.
