I think noticing someone who could be influences versus somebody who probably

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.130
 won't change should be observed early on and as your as your

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.270
 leading and as you're instructing, coaching, mentoring, whatever the

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.410
 category of supervision you're using. If that individual is grasping

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.550
 on and and maybe taking some of the criticisms, maybe some of the

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.690
 the tips and the key items that you're giving, that's an individual

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.830
 that is worth throwing your information to those who are not willing

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.970
 to change, they're going to be in that situation. I think you still

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.110
 need to be fair and offer up that information, but just know and understand

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.250
 and not get your feelings hurt when they're not going to change

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.390
 and they're going to do their own thing.
