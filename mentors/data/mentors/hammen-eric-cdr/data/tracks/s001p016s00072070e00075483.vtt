00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.730
I think the most dangerous thing would would definitely be my two tours

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.600
 in Afghanistan. Both from flying in an open door, Huey through the

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.480
 mountains of Afghanistan, being shot at with small arms fire to being,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.350
 uh, poised with the seal team in a in a local village under Cem

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.230
 Cem. Scrupulous, uh, times and some very kinetic activity. I think both

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.100
 of those memories, I guess in recent past is would be considered

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.980
 the most dangerous things.
