I guess when I'm asked about my leadership style and maybe a sense or

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.720
 phrase that captures it is don't be weird. People read you, they understand

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.650
 you. And if you're fake, they're going to read that, and they're

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.580
 not going to respect that. So much so where I've actually gotten

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.510
 a plaque and awards from other classes who have maintained that same

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.450
 motto of Don't be weird because it's so relevant even in today's

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.380
 military.
