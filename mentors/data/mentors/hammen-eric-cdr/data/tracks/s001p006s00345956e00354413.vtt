I think a junior leader can still maintain closeness with their team without

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.760
 fraternization is if they're firm but fair. I think everybody

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.220
 respects a ninja vigil who is consistent in their leadership. That

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.670
 is not playing favoritism with others. That gives everybody equal opportunities

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.130
 to advance, to perform toe have those chances and maybe

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.590
 sometimes even reminding, reminding them that once they achieve a leadership

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.040
 position that this is the model it should ascribe. Thio and

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.500
 I think that it's it's a fine line sometimes, but it's definitely achievable,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.950
 and we see some of the greatest leaders be able to accomplish

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.410
 that.
