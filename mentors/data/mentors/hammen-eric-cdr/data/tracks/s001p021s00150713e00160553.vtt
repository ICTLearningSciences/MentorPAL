00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.020
Okay, so the chaplain Corps is unique. Um, specifically, we're talking

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.190
 about growth. So we serve the Navy, which has its own, uh, you know,

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.360
 dynamics with you have. See, you have air, you have sub, you have

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.540
 special forces, you have the CBS and you have different communities,

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.710
 the medical community, all of which we serve. And at the same time,

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.880
 the Marine Corps utilizes Navy chaplains to serve for them. So within

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.050
 the Marine Corps, you also have the air wing, you have logistics,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.220
 you have division with the ground, and you have re kon and Special

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.390
 Forces with the Marines. And finally, we also served with the Coast

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.560
 Guard. So then they have the different small bases all around the nation

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.740
 that you could serve at within the Coast Guard and even some with

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.910
 the Merchant Marine Academy. So working with civilian crews on this

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.080
 ship. So the diversity that the Navy offers is unparalleled to any

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.250
 other service and really any other job
