00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.410
I think the Navy as unique from the other branches because I think all

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.960
 the other branches are held within the Navy. For instance, we obviously

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.520
 are known for our our seapower and our ability to operate on the

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.070
 waters. But we also still have, um, ground elements that can perform.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.630
 Is Justus Well, is the army such as in the Navy SEALS? And then,

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.190
 of course, we have our aircraft that are, uh, employed on carriers

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.740
 and airfields, just like the Air Force does. And then we still have

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.300
 even some small boats that made you Cem activities that the Coast Guard

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.850
 might participate in. So I think it's, ah, service that really encompasses

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.410
 all the other functions that the other branches have.
