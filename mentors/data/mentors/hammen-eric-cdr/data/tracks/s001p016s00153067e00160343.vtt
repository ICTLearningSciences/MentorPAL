I guess the part of the future that I'm most worried about is maybe, um,

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.210
 specifically, in the military. What's gonna happen with our near

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.890
 pier enemies as China and Russia and Iraq and North Korea start to build

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.570
 up their forces? Uh, America is no longer the dominant superpower,

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.250
 and we're gonna have individuals that are ready Thio combat us and

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.930
 take care of us. So I think that that is probably one thing of my

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.610
 future that I might worry the most about.
