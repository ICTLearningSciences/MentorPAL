00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.040
when I start writing an evil or from writing even a fit rep for a junior

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.230
 officer, what I like to do is take uh, the commander's intent at

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.420
 our command wherever we're at. And I tried to synthesize their job and

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.610
 their input into what the commander's intent. So if they're meeting

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.800
 something specific, usually four or five priorities that they have,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.990
 I try to interweave that information in there. What I try to dio

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.180
 is always right to the next rank above, where they're at because you're

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.370
 writing an evil to prove that they can do the next next rate ahead.
