00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.230
a Sfar is becoming a chaplain. It it is, is competitive because I think

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.600
 in the military, in general, across the board, um, we're looking for

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.980
 the best and the brightest. And so, um, being a good minister or

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.350
 pastor or priest or imam out in the civilian world does not hold the

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.730
 same requirements, even physical standards that one must maintain to

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.100
 build to keep up with those 18 to 24 year olds. So a lot of people

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.480
 are disqualified just based on age or based on their physical standards.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.860
 And then it comes down to the requirements as faras experience

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.230
 in education. So to become a chaplain, you have to have a bachelor's

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.610
 degree and a master's degree, plus at least two years of ministry

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.980
 experience. And that's not equal out in the civilian world. So I would

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.360
 say it's competitive to even just become a chaplain. And then while

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.730
 you're in the chaplaincy, if everybody is at that, high rate is just

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.110
 more competitive. Toe promote into advance
