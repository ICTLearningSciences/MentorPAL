00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.640
There was one time where I was put in into unethical, uh, dilemma when

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.440
 there is a company that would donate K cups and Courage machines Thio

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.230
 the sailors and two Marines. And we had one company and they were

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.030
 all free and they're unsolicited. But one company delivered a semi

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.820
 truck full of K cups 90 pallets, and it was actually so many K cups

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.620
 that we could not, um, handle that we could not store. So what ended

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.410
 up happening? And as I had to almost speak to our jag but toe ask for

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.200
 sailors and Marines and Coast Guardsmen, whoever were stationed there

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.000
 to take a couple cases home for their own personal use? Um, the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.790
 K Cups were there for the sailors and Marines and Coast Guardsmen to

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.590
 use. So it was one thing that I was a little uncomfortable with. But

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.380
 after talking to our legal team and, um, different individuals were

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.180
 ableto to clear that as long as they were active duty military, the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.970
 company was okay with it.
