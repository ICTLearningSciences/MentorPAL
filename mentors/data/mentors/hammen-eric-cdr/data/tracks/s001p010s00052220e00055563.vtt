I think one way to connect more deeply with your memories is toe. Really?

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.210
 Listen to not be thinking about our response or trying to one up

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.390
 that individual or to always say, Oh, I know what you're feeling is

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.570
 sometimes just listening. And as they're discussing their circumstances,

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.740
 you're just agreeing with them and understanding and empathizing

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.920
 the things that they're going through and not having Thio place yourself

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.100
 in every single situation. It makes them feel, uh, wanted. It

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.280
 makes them feel appreciated and cared for.
