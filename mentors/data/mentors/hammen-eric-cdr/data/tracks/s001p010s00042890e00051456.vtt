I think some tips that to really earn the trust of your team is to, um,

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.980
 being consistent with what you say. So even if it's something small,

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.550
 as when you're gonna be someplace or meet some someone at a location

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.120
 that you're on time, that you're consistent, I think once you start

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.690
 saying things that you don't do, the trust gets lost very quickly.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.250
 And I think that goes outside of your circle. If you say things,

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.820
 the others, um, that are not true or that may come back to be, yeah,

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.390
 un effective, you're going to see that it's going to get back to your

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.950
 people, and I think that trust is also gonna be eroded that way,

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.520
 too.
