I think living in the military, we're gonna understand that there's gonna

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.170
 be a increase in tempo, whether you're you're ratcheting up for,

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.320
 ah, deployment, whether it's something Connecticut's happening around

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.480
 you or their circumstances, whether it's family or within work. I

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.640
 think that you have to if you're taking care of yourself. If you're

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.800
 taking care of your mind, body and spirit, those types of things kind

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.960
 of mitigate themselves, and you can manage them much more effectively.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.110
 Stress that comes at you is much more easily overcome because

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.270
 you have already taken care of, um, yourself in a different circumstances

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.430
 that you're dealing with.
