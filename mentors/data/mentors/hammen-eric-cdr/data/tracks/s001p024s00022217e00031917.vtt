I think if you see or hear about any kind of sexual assault or harassment,

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.620
 I think it it comes down to the rule here something or see something.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.000
 You do something. I think you need to go to the individual first

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.390
 at the lowest level possible. And from there you take it up chain

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.770
 of command, that they do not report it. If they do not address it,

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.160
 then you take it up the chain of command. Now, if it's the victim,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.540
 it is there right to report or UN report whether they want to do a formal

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.930
 investigation there, that's up to them. But I think you need to

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.310
 immediately. If it's gonna hurt outside of people, I would again,

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.700
 another great resource to go to is the chaplain because of the confidentiality,

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.080
 and that person should be able to help you pinpoint who

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.470
 to talk to, who not to talk to. What are the rules? What are the regulations

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.850
 and the re sources that are available
