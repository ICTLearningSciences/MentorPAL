00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.220
what? I'm trying to recruit new team members or interviewing individual.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.590
 One thing I wanna know is, Are they teachable? Are they humble? Are

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.960
 they teachable? Are they willing to take, uh, instruction? Because

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.330
 very few people come into an organization or into a certain situation,

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.700
 truly prepared for what they're getting themselves into. And so

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.070
 if they have the base line characteristics or baseline skills that

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.440
 they need, whether that's education, whether that's training or experience,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.810
 they meet that. And then I need them to be flexible. I need

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.180
 them to be agile and humble and how they go about getting to the level

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.550
 where they could be in active member of our team.
