00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.580
working with people of different faith is is challenging for some, But

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.300
 to me it's an opportunity. It's an opportunity to learn others, because

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.030
 ultimately, when we're discussing truth and what we're discussing,

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.760
 what we believe is the way it's, it's an opportunity for us to really

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.480
 see the world through there. Their lens me, coming from a small

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.210
 town in the Midwest is gonna have a different observation of what

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.940
 life looks like than somebody from Southern California or from Bronx,

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.660
 New York. And so it goes the same way with somebody else's faith.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.390
 And it just brings those opportunities and rich moments to really connect

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.110
 with humankind much like they would have, maybe in biblical times.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.840
 For me, um, toe, look at people who speak different languages and

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.570
 their cultures, and it's just an increase is that understanding of

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.290
 God created people in all different shapes and sizes and beliefs and

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.020
 ethnicities, and Lord, that's it's a beautiful thing
