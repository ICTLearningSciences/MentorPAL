00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.120
I think building trust between team members does take time and again what

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.400
 comes back Thio taking, making consistency and making consistent

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.670
 decisions within them. So if I were mediating between them understanding

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.950
 that communication is important, sometimes we say something, but

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.220
 we mean a different thing. And so to build a clarify between those

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.500
 individuals what the actual intent is goes away from a lot of miscommunication,

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.770
 which helps foster trust, helps foster that relationship

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.050
 and gets them on the right track.
