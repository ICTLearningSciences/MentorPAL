00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.750
um, some of the things that are very practical that you have to get ready

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.660
 for you deploy, making sure all your household goods are in order,

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.560
 making sure your family has all the different things that they need.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.470
 But one thing I like to do personally is, uh, make sure I have things

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.370
 on this ship that I'm gonna have or or if I'm out with the Marines,

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.280
 making sure And that could be anything from having cards with

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.180
 me or notes that I can send back having stamps, Um, in case that there's

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.090
 no conductivity, maybe having something set up. If I know I'm going

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.990
 to be a place where I can communicate, Do I have the right equipment?

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.900
 Um, to do that and just really trying to think ahead of what

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.800
 is not gonna be available on this ship or at my location and maybe bringing

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.710
 extra stuff in regards to that
