00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.140
So if you take away a gun from someone who was planning on killing themselves,

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.440
 um they will most likely find another avenue thio the harm

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.730
 themselves. But it may be a lot more difficult. Eso we see different

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.020
 Even within genders, there are different ways of killing themselves.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.320
 Where you see ah man is more likely. Thio use a handgun or something

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.610
 much more violent where a woman may do something along lines of ingesting

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.910
 too many pills, toe overdose or something along those lines.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.200
 So but it does help. It does. It does keep them, maybe one step away

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.490
 from it. But ultimately we want to keep them in a safe environment

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.790
 across the board. We want to continue to have contact with the individual

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.080
 until they're out of the clear.
