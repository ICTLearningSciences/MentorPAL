00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.240
I think one thing that encourages accountability is, um, your presence

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.630
 and knowing that you are going to be seeking that I think if if you

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.020
 ask an individual for a certain task and you never come back and acknowledged

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.410
 that the task was done or that a task was attempted, they're

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.790
 less likely in the future toe want to even conduct that task? So

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.180
 I think if if you get involved and not that you're in the weeds so

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.570
 much that you're in hindrance. But you're asking and enquiring about

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.960
 the product and and where it is on the the completion spectrum, I think

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.350
 that really goes to, ah culture of accountability.
