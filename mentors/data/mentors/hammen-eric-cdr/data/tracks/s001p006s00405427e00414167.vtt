00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.120
I think that my view of my line of work has changed over time by the sheer

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.380
 fact of my maturity, where when you first start off as a as a junior

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.650
 officer is a chaplain, you have a much more tactical mindset.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.920
 The here and now, um, the daily tasks at hand, taking care of the people,

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.180
 boots on the ground to where I'm at now as a commander where I

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.450
 have a much more administrative or operational sometimes even strategic

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.720
 mindset. How can I change, um, the chaplain corps in the next 10

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.980
 years versus How can I change my unit? So it really it's a progression

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.250
 of maturity and leadership as you go forward in the ranks.
