00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.430
I think reward for good performance is done in public. I think it's done

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.020
 where everybody is aware that this individual did it, um, their hard

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.600
 work should be acknowledged. Just like I believe correction should

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.190
 be done in private. Hard work should be done outwardly. If that individual

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.770
 has been uh to you and has notified that they get embarrassed

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.350
 by that type of reward, then maybe you can alter it and maybe do

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.940
 it on a smaller scale. But I definitely think it needs to be addressed,

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.520
 and it should be done immediately, not ah, year later or six months

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.110
 later. I think it should be done on the spot or shortly after.
