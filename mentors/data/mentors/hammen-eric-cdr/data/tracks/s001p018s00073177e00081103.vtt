00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.570
 are Ah, sailor, that is successful and doing well in their job, you

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.940
 might find yourself moving more frequently like myself. I've always

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.300
 been asked to go different places that were the next challenge. But

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.660
 typically you can expect anywhere from between 2.5 to 3 years having

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.020
 to move someplace. If you're in a major fleet concentration, whether

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.390

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.750
 stay within that region and to still be competitive in a different

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.110
 bill it.
