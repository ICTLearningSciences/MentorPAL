00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.070
I think a leader really has an opportunity to change a team. Um, and I

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.290
 think by doing so are the thing that they would need to do. This is

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.510
 tau motivate the people underneath them, allow them to see the vision

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.730
 that the leader has and allow them to grasp it as their own to provide

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.950
 ownership to that. Because if that is done, then it's It's no

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.170
 longer that I'm serving, uh, this specific commander and trying to get

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.390
 to their intent. But how are we as an organization or as a group

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.610
 meeting the same goals that we all have? And so getting buy in from

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.830
 those I think is can be ground changing for that organization of that

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.050
 division.
