00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.240
served with the Marines is always is always a good opportunity because

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.640
 the Marines love chaplains. The Marines love having you there. There

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.030
 is a role for you. There is a need for you. Like many other platforms

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.420
 or operations, the chaplain sometimes can be, um, second nature.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.820
 But with the Marines, they're the first ones there. Where is my chaplain?

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.210
 And so having that knowledge that you're wanted and needed and

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.600
 provided it was never short of any work based on the age of the Marines

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.990
 having such young Marines in 18 to 24 year olds. So we were always

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.390
 busy, but it was a pleasure, and it was it was a great opportunity.
