00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.820
So I think when someone separates from the military really depends on

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.780
 if it was voluntary or involuntary. Those who usually separate separate

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.750
 on a voluntary basis have some sort of preparation, have a plan,

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.710
 have something in line that they were looking to for a very long time,

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.680
 and so that separation is much easier now. They may come to a point

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.640
 where they realize that, um, they're not part of the same club they

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.610
 have been for a very long time. So there is a transition for that.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.580
 Those who were separated involuntarily have a little bit bigger struggle.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.540
 Maybe they didn't do the same leg work that the other individual

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.510
 did. So they have. Hopefully. Still, some of the same resource

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.470
 is that they can talk thio even talking to a chapel and to help prepare

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.440
 for that, um, to get to different options that they may have. But

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.400
 it really depends on where they're coming from. And what is their

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.370
 value
