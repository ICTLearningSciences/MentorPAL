00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.780
my child was fairly normal. I had to immigrant parents. One who was from

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.710
 France and my father's family was from Holland. He and, uh, whose

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.640
 middle class He was a police officer my entire life where my mother

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.570
 was a translator in a welding company, Miller Electric. I have two

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.510
 older brothers, 10 years in about eight years, and they were pretty

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.440
 much out of the house by the time I was in my formative years. And so

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.370
 it was a pretty normal situation in a small town where I knew everybody

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.300
 and went to school with the same people from kindergarten to high

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.230
 school, which is actually one of the reasons which drew me to want

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.160
 to leave and explore and try something else in the military.
