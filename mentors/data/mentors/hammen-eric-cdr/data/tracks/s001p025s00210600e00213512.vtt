00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.700
so as a leader were talking outside of a chaplain. Once the individual

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.560
 is gonna harm themselves or somebody else, uh, from a chaplain's perspective,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.410
 we don't tell them ever unless that person comes to us and

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.260
 asks us to share, um, what their intent is. And so we have to find

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.120
 a way to craft a KNOPPER. Tune it for them to get outside help, or

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.970
 somebody outside of the chain of command that is not a chaplain.
