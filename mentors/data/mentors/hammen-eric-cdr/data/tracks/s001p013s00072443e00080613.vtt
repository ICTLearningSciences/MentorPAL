00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.480
So I think it's critical that you really examine yourself and not just

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.120
 once but continuously to understand how to be a good leader. You don't

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.750
 need to understand your shortcomings so you can fill the shortcomings

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.380
 with people on your team that are gonna, um, take the take the

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.020
 place of your mistakes. And you also need to understand that, uh, maybe

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.650
 there's people that are too close to you or to similar to you.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.280
 That may be redundancy and a team, but just ultimately understanding

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.920
 where you are at the time on that team, what your role is, even as

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.550
 the leader and how that's gonna affect the other team members.
