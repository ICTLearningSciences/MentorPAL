WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.800
as a leader. The hours do change because now you have an added responsibility.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.750
 So you have no responsibility to, in my opinion, be the first

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.710
 one there and and the last one to leave. There's rare occasions where

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.660
 you wanna push some leadership down to train the next level of

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.610
 petty officers or junior officers to meet that level, where you give

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.560
 them more responsibility on time management. But really, it comes down

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.520
 to your always on. You're always on watch. You're always on duty

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.470
 because your your business is to take care of people the most important

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.420
 weapon system the Navy has.
