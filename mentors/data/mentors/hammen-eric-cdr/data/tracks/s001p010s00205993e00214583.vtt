00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.670
I think to identify strengths and weaknesses of team members really comes

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.500
 down to getting to know your people having conversations, and it

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.320
 may not be in a professional sense. Sometimes it's in a personal, um,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.150
 engagement that you may have as a command together. Maybe you're

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.970
 you're all bowling together as a command to get to know each other,

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.800
 paintball or attending an academic or athletic engagement. I think you

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.620
 you get to know those individuals and you know their strengths and

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.450
 their weaknesses, and then when you're having opportunity to place

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.270
 them in those roles, their performance will be a great tell off what

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.100
 they're good at and what they're not, and to not be afraid to adjust

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.920
 those is going to be the key aspect of what a leader can actually

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.750
 do.
