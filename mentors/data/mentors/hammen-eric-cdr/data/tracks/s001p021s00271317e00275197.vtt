Sometimes finding a mentor can be an awkward situation because you're

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.470
 in a place where you don't wanna be rejected. But at the same time,

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.780
 you know, this is something you need. So I think naturally we gravitate

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.090
 towards people, um that are, like us or that are in the same circumstances.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.410
 Us. And I think pretty easily you can find someone senior

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.720
 to you. They may have shown an interest in you, at least personally.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.030
 So that would be where I would start closest to me as I went. And

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.340
 if that person is, has a career that you can see you getting into,

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.650
 I think that's the natural start for that.
