00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.930
I think conflict is normal. Any place where you, um, put human beings

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.010
 in a situation, I think some of that can be mitigated by observing and

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.090
 doing the research before you get to that unit and also being someone

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.180
 who listens twice as much as they speak and get an opportunity

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.260
 to really try to connect with those personalities, um, involved. Before

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.340
 any changes are made or any okay, sweeping movements are done in

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.420
 order to change their leadership style.
