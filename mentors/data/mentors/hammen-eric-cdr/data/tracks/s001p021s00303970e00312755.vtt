00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.840
I think having the right training degree or experiences is very important.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.820
 While you're in the military, it's gonna it's gonna really characterize

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.810
 your service and to what jobs you are qualified for. But more

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.800
 importantly, you know, most of our life has done outside the military.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.790
 Eventually, one day we do get out and Soto have, ah, competitive

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.770
 degree or experience that will translate out in the civilian world.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.760
 I think is very crucial. And sometimes those degrees don't match

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.750
 up. For instance, maybe you are wanna be a business person, but in the

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.740
 Navy, you're a swot or you're an aviator. So having a degree, an

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.720
 MBA and business might be something that will put you at the next level

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.710
 out in the civilian world. So I think it just depends on your goals

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.700
 and your situation.
