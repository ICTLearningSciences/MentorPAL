00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.950
you know, as a parent, you see a lot of different styles bleed over into,

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.050
 you know, even parenting your Children. Sometimes I think you have

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.140
 to watch out to not treat your Children like they're your subordinates

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.240
 and understand that they're just kids. But it also gives you a

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.340
 skill set of supervision and maybe, uh, staying on top of things and

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.440
 not letting things get too far down. And and I don't think there's

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.540
 anything wrong with having high expectations for your family, and I

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.630
 think it makes you a stronger unit. But just to really understand that

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.730
 they're your kids, they're not your subordinates and to really be

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.830
 able to separate those two when you're dealing with them.
