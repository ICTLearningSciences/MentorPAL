00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.450
So if you're ever in a situation where you feel that a person is suicidal

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.060
 or potentially could be the only way, and the best way to really

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.660
 do it is to ask outright, you may feel awkward at first and say, Do

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.270
 you want to kill yourself? But there are ways to go about and saying,

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.870
 You know people in your circumstance, whether it's people who have

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.470
 just recently divorced or people who have lost their jobs sometimes

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.080
 they consider, uh, killing themselves. Is that something you've thought

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.680
 about but really stating the fact? Because if you say, Do you

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.290
 feel like doing something stupid or harming yourself? It's kind of beating

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.890
 around the bush and doesn't really get to the answer. It really

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.500
 what it does is we want to give them permission to talk about it.
