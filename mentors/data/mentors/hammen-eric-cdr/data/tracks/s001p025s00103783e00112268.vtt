00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.460
So throughout my career, especially my deployments over to Afghanistan,

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.060
 I have, unfortunately been, um, on the front lines and my first tour

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.670
 with the Marines. I probably had to deal with hundreds of individuals

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.270
 being sent back on C one thirties transfer ceremonies where we

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.880
 put bodies on plane and send, um, to Dover to a family member, Um, and

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.490
 then again, with special forces at a much smaller scale but still

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:40.090
 personal, Ah, personal experience, where individuals that I knew are

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.700
 served with died and gave the ultimate sacrifice.
