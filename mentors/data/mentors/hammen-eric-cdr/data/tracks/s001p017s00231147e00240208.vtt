00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.070
One thing I do to make sure that my family is taking care of is you know

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.280
 I have. I have a wife who is extremely capable and and runs, um,

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.500
 things flawlessly. In fact, sometimes when I come home off deployment

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.720
 or from a long trip, I almost feel like that I am throwing something

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.940
 into the the smooth machine that's messing it up. So, you know, preparing

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.150
 my family over communicating with them, making sure that the

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.370
 things that they have coming up on the horizon, whether it's for school,

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.590
 whether it's a, uh, something financially that I go ahead and

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.810
 pre prepare for that to be done. That could be if I'm going on deployment,

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.020
 calling the cell phone carrier, making sure they know I'm not

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.240
 there or letting my bank know that I will not be using my cards to

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.460
 those things and services that I would not be using
