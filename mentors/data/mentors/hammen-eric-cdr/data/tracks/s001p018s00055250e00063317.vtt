I think owning and renting really depends on your comfortable ity of having

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.240
 or being a landlord. If you're going to be at a location for three

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.940
 years. I don't think it's a bad idea. Thio by, ah, property that's

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.640
 affordable. Nothing outside of your range, living it for three years

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.340
 and then possibly turn it into a rental property. Now, mind you

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.030
 knowing the history of that area and knowing that there's always going

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.730
 to be military people around, that would be a safe bet to do, but

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.430
 really depends on your comfortable Ah, you know, attitude towards

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.130
 having a rental apartment, but buying if you're there for a long enough,

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.820
 if you're there for a short amount of time, I would consider renting.
