00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.830
in a new leadership position. I really think it's important for that individual,

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.800
 um, to just rest and to take a look around the 3 60 view

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.780
 of what is going on and to not jump in and try to change everything

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.760
 all at once, to maybe observe other individuals who have a leadership

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.730
 style or potentially in a position that they would love to be in in

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.710
 the future and emulate that come alongside. Those who have been there,

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.690
 who have the experience, not be prideful, have an opportunity to

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.670
 give yourself permission to make mistakes and to grow upon those.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.640
 But to really the first steps, I believe, is to not jump into anything.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.620
 And Thio, just sit and wait.
