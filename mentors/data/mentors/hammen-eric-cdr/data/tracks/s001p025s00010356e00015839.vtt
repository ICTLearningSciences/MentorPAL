00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.070
So I think responding to a suicide comes with a few different complications

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.280
 because of cultural, um, and theological beliefs on what suicide

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.500
 means. Everybody has a different perception, but I think people still

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.720
 go through the grief. Still go through a lot of questioning. Um,

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.930
 the one caveat you may have with suicide is individuals asking, What

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.150
 if I have Dunmore? What if I was stepped in or saw the signs? So

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.370
 you may have to deal with some secondary and third order effects of

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.590
 your sailors as they cope with this. And then you have to deal with

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.800
 individuals who may be joke about the suicide or, um, say that the place

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.020
 is better off without him. They didn't want him there anyways,

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.240
 so you have to deal with those types of reactions which are valid reactions

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.450
 and and very normal. But to understand that and have the resource

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.670
 is available
