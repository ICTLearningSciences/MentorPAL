I think when you can tell someone's a good mentor is that they're the

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.860
 ones showing interest in you. Without you even knowing it. They're giving

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.860
 you guidance. They're giving you support. Uh, they might see something

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.870
 in you that sparked an interest in them, but it's natural for

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.870
 them. You know that. It's going to be something, uh, longstanding.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.880
 I think if you are the one that has to constantly contact your mentor,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.880
 it's probably not gonna last very long.
