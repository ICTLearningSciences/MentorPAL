00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.970
I think there's certain conduct issues that need to be brought forth that

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.080
 should not be handled in house in house. You know, we always wanna

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.200
 handle every situation at the lowest level possible. But when you

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.320
 have conduct issues that are gonna affect the command as a whole, um,

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.440
 or it's gonna affect someone outside of the command. I think those

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.550
 need to be brought up to the chain of command and be brought forward

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.670
 many times with individual is gonna hurt themselves or another. Those

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.790
 are things that need outside help that needs to be brought to the

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.910
 commands, attention and things that are, you know, much more simpler

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.020
 that are only affecting that individual that can be resolved quickly.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.140
 Those types of things that could remain in house.
