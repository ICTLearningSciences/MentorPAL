00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.860
so I think that there is many different types of harassment that you see

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.860
 that's beyond sexual harassment. It could be from just someone's

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.870
 lifestyle. Maybe they do not participate in the same things that the

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.880
 rest of the crew do, or the rest of division does, and they might be

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.880
 singled out. Maybe it's It's just something like in high school where

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.890
 this person doesn't like sports and they have other interests over

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.890
 here. They could be harassed for that. Sometimes if they don't want

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.900
 to partake in alcohol or those types of activities that could be

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.910
 harassed. And so the harassment really Onley goes to the imagination

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.910
 of the individual. But sexual harassment is one of them, but not the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.920
 only.
