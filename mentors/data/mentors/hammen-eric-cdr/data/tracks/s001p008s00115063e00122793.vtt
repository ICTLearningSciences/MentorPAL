00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.510
after the Navy, I could see myself doing something in the realms of education.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.170
 I always enjoyed teaching. And I really, uh, cherish the time

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.840
 I had as an instructor and I believe as a as a chaplain or a pastor.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.500
 Our rule really is to take the complicated and make it simple. And

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.160
 so I think I see myself at a university community college, whether

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.820
 as adjunct professor or working in registration, taking care of militaries,

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.490
 uh, individuals, families, veterans and working that relevance

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.150
 mawr so than in the church.
