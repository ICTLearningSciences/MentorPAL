00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.970
I think the best ways you could develop skills within teams is really

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.080
 by practice. I think understanding what the intent is of the mission

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.200
 of the team, maybe what the mission of or the intent of the commander

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.320
 is and to get in and to really practice those things. Some people

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.430
 will sit and study and and research, but until it's actually done in

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.550
 real time, I think that's gonna be the true test.
