00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.160
I think getting a team, um, to meet the standards that's having trouble

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.480
 is sometimes it can be challenging. But again, if we're transparent

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.790
 with what we're trying to accomplish, if we're accepting that there

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.100
 is okay, toe make mistakes but also understand that we can take that

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.410
 responsibility. And it's not how we get knocked down or how many

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.730
 times but how we pick ourselves up as a team, and I think if we can

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.040
 come together knowing that they're not doing that by themselves, I think

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.350
 that's one way that they can meet. Those goals and Thio get to

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.670
 a place where something that they're struggling on can really be overcome.
