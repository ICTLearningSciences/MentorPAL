00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.500
you know, a typical story or thing that would happen in my job as a leader.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.160
 I remember helping ah, young sailor who was having some issues

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.810
 with his specific leader in his division. Um, I got an opportunity

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.470
 to walk through some leadership aspects of what it takes, um, to serve

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.120
 under many different personalities. But get an opportunity to, uh,

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.780
 correctly go through his chain of command, walk him through that,

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.430
 um, together and almost be a mitigator between those two individuals

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.090
 where it ended up working out that it was miscommunication. When both

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.740
 people were on the same page. They got along great and no careers

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.400
 were hurt or suffered, and things got were able to be accomplished

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.050
 and got done.
