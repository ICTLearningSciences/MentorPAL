00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.210
my name's commander, Eric Hamon, Um, chaplain serving a top nav staff

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.570
 up at the Pentagon. My journey really started in 1992 as an enlisted

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.930
 sailor, where I made it up to Petty Officer First Class and around

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.300
 2004 I felt a call to the ministry, and after completing both of my

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.660
 degrees, I became a chaplain. There I served on different staffs, one

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.020
 with Second Marine Aircraft Wing, where I earned my warfare pin, and

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.380
 it served a very kinetic tour there in Afghanistan, followed by a

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.740
 second tour with Naval Special Warfare Group two. And when the seal

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.100
 teams were, we also had a lot of difficulty in country of Afghanistan.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.470
 From there I became an instructor and ultimately on the USS San

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.830
 Antonio as a department head. Now I currently served on the staff under

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.190
 a two star. I do have a wife of 25 years and four Children.
