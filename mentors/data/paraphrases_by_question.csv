Were you worried about starting college?,What were some of your fears entering college and your career?,"One of the biggest fears that I had joining college was that I wasn't good enough. When I started going to Berkeley, I just barely started computer science. So, I was a noob. I was just a very new person with computer science and during the orientation, there's is this guy that's, you know, kind of, explaining what the campus is like, what life is going to be like, what you can expect from the liberal campus and I was sitting in the computer science group and to my left and right were two of my newest friends. To my left, there was a Java programmer, he'd been programming for eight years, he was an expert in this field, he'd, you know, made several programs and, like, he explained all of this to me and I'm like, ""Okay, we're going to be going to the same class, alright"" and to my right, there was somebody very very similar. He was, like, accepted to Stanford and he went to Berkeley because it's cheaper but, he had been programming since he was twelve, when he made his first computer, you know, like, blah blah blah and I was like, ""Okay, so this is the average people going to my university and we're going to be taking the, all right, I got some work for me to do."" So, that was what was on my plate when I first started going. For the military, I would say that something similar was going, I felt was going to happen. I joined the nuclear technology side of the Electrician's mate course and I had never liked engineering things at all, at all. I was the opposite. I liked driving my car but if you told me to change my oil, I would say, ""I don't think so. I'm going to take it in to Midas."" I don't like grease, I didn't like screw drivers. The biggest accomplishment I'd done, as far as, like, mechanical type things was, I had put shingles on a house and yeah, I was outside and yeah, you know, the air smelled fine but those mechanical type jobs, I just didn't feel at that time was for me. So, that's one of the reasons I actually joined the nuclear side of the Electrician's Mate. It's because, I actually wanted to challenge myself in that. I wanted to, kind of, see what that side was like, so. But when I joined, I'm pretty sure everybody there had a big head start over me that I had to overcome.",Did you have fears going into college or your career?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
