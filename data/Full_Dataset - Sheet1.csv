Background,,Can you briefly tell me about yourself?,"My name is EMC Clint Anderson. I have been in the Navy for about eight years, ever since 2000 for active duty and then eight more years as a reservist since 2008 until 2016. I went to college at the end of the tour that I did and the Navy gave me free benefits so I've been going to my bachelor's course at the University of California at Berkeley and then my master's course at the University of Southern California. I'm studying game development.

Background,,Who are you and what do you do?,"My name is EMC Clint Anderson, that's Electrician's Mate Clinton Anderson. I was born in Los Angeles, California. I was raised there most of my life and I graduated from high school there. A couple of years after graduating from high school, I joined the United States Navy. I was an Electrician's Mate for eight years. I served on an aircraft carrier. We went on many deployments. A deployment is when you go to war, you fight. We fought in the Iraq war. I went on three deployments and it was a really great time in my life. I had a lot of fun. At the end of the eight years, I decided that the Navy wasn't quite a career for me. So, I got out of the Navy. I started using the education benefits that we received and I started going to the University of California at Berkeley. I was majoring in computer science and afterwards, I started getting my master's degree from the University of Southern California. I also had a job at the Institute for Creative Technologies. It's been a lot of fun, this whole time. Thanks to the Navy.",Tell me your life story.,What is your history?,I want to know everything about you?,Explain your background.,,,,,,

Background,,Tell me about your childhood.,"So, I have a childhood that's pretty similar to many military people that I meet. When I was young, my parents divorced. My father, he was in the army. So I didn't see him that much. I lived with my mother for a long time. We moved from state to state. I lived in Washington for a while, I lived in Alabama for a while. Eventually, I moved back with my father instead of my mother, in California. So, I have actually seen a lot of America, thanks to their divorce. Eventually, I graduated from high school and after high school, me and my father we didn't really get along so I broke away from him and a couple of years afterwards I realized that I needed some kind of jobs help me with my finances, help me, you know find some kind of direction in life.

Background,,Tell me about your family.,"I had a great opportunity to know most of my family throughout my lifetime. My parents were divorced, so that means that I spent sometime with my mother's family, sometime with my father's family, sometime with my father's mother and sometimes with my mother's mother. So, I bounced around from household to household when I was a youth. I didn't really form any strong bonds with anyone but I did get an opportunity to see most of the world so I spent a couple years with my grandmother in Alabama. So, I got to shoot a few guns there and got to climb mountains and do all of that country stuff that, you know, a lot of people come into the Navy with. I just also lived in Michigan and it's kind of an impoverished area, if you have been watching movies and things, you probably know about this but it's developed my character in a lot of ways. Eventually, I finally moved to California and I have to say, out of all the places that I've been, which is all over America, California is the right place to be. It has a temperature that I want, the people and the diversity I want.

Background,,Can you tell me more about Michigan?,"In Michigan, it's the place that I stayed had a diverse amount of people but it was mostly crime ridden in some places. I've seen lots of things that you see on movies. For instance, drug use, some violence here and there. I've seen more graphic things like prostitution, homeless shelter and things like that. But those are things that I think maybe turned me into wanting to help my society a little bit more. Those are negative things. These are things that kind of pushed me to want to make the world a better place because I saw them.

"Background, Education",,What kind of student were you?,"So, the type of student that I was in college, in high school and in elementary school, it varied. It was kind of like a sine wave. So, when I was in elementary school, I always took tests and they always said that I was like very very high achieving or something like that. I always scored really high on my IQs, so I got the impression that I was a really bright kid. In high school, it kind of dipped down. I was a little bit more independent. I stopped doing my homework. I stopped listening to teachers. I started hanging out with friends a lot more. So, my 4.0s and 3.8s started  going down to you know, very very low. That's one of the reason that I didn't go to college right away. I think many people in the nuclear field like I'm in had a very similar story. I'd say more than half the people had that story. They were bright as kids but they kind of somehow lost their way, ended up going to community college and then going to the military or some other situation. So, going through the military actually helped me out a lot because it taught me a lot of self discipline, a lot of reasons to get motivated to study a lot. So, after I finished my active duty Navy career, I went back to college and I was on par.

"Background, Combat",Navy,What was it like being in war? What did you do?,"During wartime, the tempo is a lot higher than it normally is. So, I fought in the Iraq war and then in the Afghanistan war and during those times we were in the middle of the ocean and days were pretty long from 6 AM to sometimes midnight very very often. We did so much training. It was a very trying time but is also rewarding because your patience is tested, your drive and your motivation is tested and eventually you fight the war and you do a lot of good things.

"Combat, Risk",Navy,I want to join the Navy but I'm afraid of going into battle...,"So, joining the military is a dangerous career. If you want to join the Navy but you're scared of going into battle, then there are obviously jobs for you but you have to inherently realize that being in the military is by definition a dangerous career. So, I was on a ship for the most of the time but they could have sent me anywhere. So, you have to be willing to accept that fact. However, even on the ship, there are dangers. For instance, you could be telling the ships where to go but they say that the top of the aircraft carrier is one of the most dangerous places that you can be, it's one of the most dangerous jobs. Additionally, once you're back home, you're with your family, you have a normal job but they could say, ""Hey, you know what? We need more people out there in the field."" So, they could just call you and you could be with the army people, with the marines people, fighting wars. But for the most part, the air force and the navy, they tend to have supporting roles to the army and the marines.",Is the military scary?,Do I have to fight in battles if I join the military?,Do I have to risk my life to serve my country?,Will I have to go into battle if I join?,Have you been in battle?,,,,,
"JobSpecific, STEM",Navy,"Though you were an Electrician's Mate, did you work on other things besides electronics?","So, my job as an EMC, Electrician's Mate is to fix pumps, to do preventive maintenance, to work on voltage regulators, to have lots of training as well. But the Navy also provides you with releases from your job. If you do the same job the whole entire time, you might get kind of frustrated, so I actually worked in the supply department which is where, for instance, there is the veins in the ship and there's like painting that needs to be done, there's lots of cleaning that has to be done. Some people work in the tech pubs library, which means that there's books for everybody on the ship that has to do their job. So you can work there for a while. So, basically for about six months to a year, you work in your main job and then they kind of give you a break even though you're on the same ship and then you have that cycle. So, you're always doing something different.",Is your position the only thing you do?,What other things do you do besides what you do with technology?,"What are duties that everyone in the Navy has to do, regardless of position?",Are electronics the only thing you worked on?,Was everything you did in the Navy about technology?,Did you do different things in the Navy?,,,,
Training,Navy,What is the training progression and what is it like?,"So, with the Navy, they always give you training. That's something that's going to be ingrained in your heart by the end of your Navy tour. So, the ways that they train you is that they have one of the people in your unit go up and provide something from a book that you probably learn in A school, that you probably learn on the job. So, for instance, the diagram of the reactor and we're supposed to know, for instance, all the valves that are there, we're supposed to know what to do in case of a casualty. For instance, if there's a fire in one of the pumps, we have to say, ""Well, you're supposed to turn off valve A, B and C"", and then call it in and then we'll tell the watch officer and then ask somebody to help and then go back and fight the fire. What happens if there is like, a radiation spill? Are you supposed to, you know, do these things? So, for instance, every time that you have a casualty, which means that there is a problem in the ship, be it a fire, a flood, scram of the reactor, which means it breaks down, then you have to know what each of those steps are. And after being in the Navy for what, a year let's say, if you don't train about it, then you're going to forget it. So, they allow a little bit of forget and then they train on it so you remember it. Then, you have that cycle of training over and over and over.",What is the training process?,What is the required training?,How is training?,Is training long?,Is training difficult?,Do they teach you a lot in the Navy?,Do you need to practice a lot in the Navy?,,,

Background,Navy,Are you an officer?,"I'm not an Officer. I'm a Chief, which is an E7 for the pay grade. The military is broken up into two portions, enlisted people who actually do the work and officers who basically manage. Now, the enlisted people, after a certain pay grade, E6 or E7, you start to supervise those enlisted people. Officers, from day one, they're automatically in charge of the whole unit.",Do you have a high rank?,Are you a Captain?,Are you in charge on the ship?,Do you have a leadership role?,,,,,,
"Education, JobSpecific",Navy,"You have a college degree, so why aren't you an officer?","I have a college degree and that allows me to apply to be an officer but not everybody who has that degree wants to go that route. So, to be an officer, you have to want to manage people, do lots of paperwork sometimes, to be in charge of the success or the failure of an entire unit and that carries a lot of responsibility. I'm an enlisted person and I do supervise the people that are underneath me. However, an officer's main goal is to become more and more important down the line. So, for instance, if you're a captain or even a commander, you could have 300-400 people underneath you and that's the main goal of most officers. For an enlisted person, you're more technically based. So, even though you have a small unit, that drive to want to lead people is slightly different.",Why aren't you an officer?,Shouldn't you be an officer?,Do you want to be an officer?,Do you get to be an officer if you're in the military a long time?,,,,,,
Jargon,Navy,What is the difference between an officer and an enlisted person?,"So, the difference between an officer and enlisted member, they kind of meld together once you get higher in superiority but the real difference is when you start. An E1 or an E2 seaman or airman, basically their only goal, their only in purpose in life is to do a technical job whereas an officer an insign (insignia), his day one is actually managing a group of people. Obviously, they're both training but the goal of what they're supposed to do is slightly different. As you get higher, as you get to become E5, 6 or 7 for enlisted or you become a lieutenant, that's an O3 for an officer, then you start going into management and supervising people. So, at least on the ship, you would see that the E7s, the Chiefs and O3s, the lieutenants are working side by side, pretty much doing the same thing but in the lower ranks, then enlisted is technical, officers are management.",What makes an officer different?,How are officers and enlisted persons different?,Is being an officer easier or harder than being an enlisted person?,What is enlisted?,What is an officer?,,,,,
JobSpecific,Navy,How do you spend most of your time on deployment?,"So, deployment life can be pretty hard sometimes. Most of the time you're working. I'd say about 75% of most days you're either going to work or coming from work or you know, sitting down preparing to go for work in a few hours. But, there is time to relax. So, many people, they join bands, they watch DVDs from the recreation center that we have there, they sit around and play cards, they kind of just sit and if it's later on at night, then you sleep, although like during the work day, you're not supposed to sleep at all. So, I remember my days would be, I would wake up at about 6:50, I would be in group, in formation at 7. It's only ten minutes I know, but you learn to be very very quick and then you're working until four o'clock. And from that point on, you could stand watch which would be another six hours after that, at least for me. Some people don't stand watch, some people do, its about half-half. Or you could be doing these trainings that come later on that night, they're called General Quarters. We were fighting a war, so they pretend like a bomb hit us or there's some kind of chemical spill or things that make you, that keep you on your feet to make sure that you have all the skills that you need to fight the casualty. So, short answer, you're working pretty much all day.",What do you do on deployment?,What is your role on deployment?,How is work different on deployment?,What are your responsibilities on deployment?,,,,,,
"Lifestyle, JobSpecific",Navy,What did you do during your off time while deployed?,"During your off time, while you're deployed, you have a couple things that you can do. So, I remember, personally I would always go play poker and steal people's money even though you're not supposed to but we'd find some ways to, you know, have fun with each other. We would trade, like coke bottles or trade cigarettes. Some people smoked, I didn't, but I'd still, you know, like be in the middle of trading things for cards. I also watched a lot of DVDs. So, we had an MWR, a morale recreation and welfare program where you have a choice of maybe 200 or 300 DVDs. You just tell them that's the one that you want and then you can watch it on, if you have your own personal DVD player or a laptop. I'd also just go out there on the fantail and just watch the ships go by, you know, ships go by and jets go by and maybe for going along the coast, just look at the beautiful country that we're going beside.",What do you do in your free time while deployed?,What do you do for fun while deployed?,What do you do when you aren't working while deployed?,How is life when deployed?,,,,,,
"Lifestyle, JobSpecific",Navy,How do you spend most of your time off deployment?,"So, when you're not deployed, life is actually pretty good. So, the military comes in waves. Our hard time is when we go on deployment. That's when you give it your all, that's when you're working the hardest but when you come back then they kind of go easy on you. So, well actually, I was living in San Diego. This is an example from when I was down there and our days were pretty early so that we fight the rush hour traffic. I think they began at six and then noon, that's when we normally have our lunch but they just send us home. So, days are cut short at six hours and so you just like, actually it's five hours because the traffic is the thing that cuts most of the morning. So, days are from seven to noon and then you split and go home and go see your family. So, you have a lot more time sometimes when you get off deployment.",What is work like off deployment?,What is your role off of deployment?,What are your duties off deployment?,How is work different off deployment?,,,,,,
JobSpecific,Navy,Describe the work you do on a typical day (on/off deployment),"The work that I tend to do on a typical day actually depends on whether I'm deployed or not deployed. So, on deployment, then you pretty much are working the whole day and it's broken up into chunks. The first part of the day is just getting together, talking about how the rest of the day is going to be, do work orders. We write about the things that we should be doing for, maybe the next week or the next couple of hours or something like that. So the next chunk is we actually go and perform the work. So that's about another three or four hours. The next chunk is we get back and we start doing training, so we make sure that we're ready for casualties that happen, if there's a fire, if there's a flood. Then that's about the time that you get off work and you have a couple of hours just to kind of relax and hang out but later on at night, then you do this thing called General Quarters which means that you come back and the whole ship pretends like there is a big casualty happened to the entire ship. So your days can go into the night. When you are not deployed and you're stationed, you know, stateside, then your days are a lot easier. You have one part of, you know, training what we want to do later on. You have another part of training where you just open up a book and review some electronics or nuclear power things and then you have a small part where you are just doing preventive maintenance, which means that you're working on a pump, make sure that's fine, opening up regulators, making sure you know, nothing's inside and putting new equipment on the ship.",What is a regular day like?,What is a typical day like in the Navy?,What do you do on a normal day?,What are you daily responsibilities?,,,,,,
"Background, Lifestyle",,What are you doing now that you aren't active duty Navy?,"Now that I'm not in the active duty Navy, I joined the US Navy Reserves and I've been there for about the last eight years. So, that job isn't extremely difficult. They say that it's two days per month, two weeks per year and I've actually worked a lot more than that but it's a minimal time in the military. So, I've had a lot of time to do whatever I wanted to. I've split it between working at jobs. For instance, my job is, I'm a Japanese teacher in Japan but also work for the University of Southern California Institute for Creative Technologies and I find little pieces of jobs here and there. So, I'm a part of a start-up. A computer science start-up working with virtual reality. I also go to school.

Money,Navy,How much do you earn working for the Navy?,"So, your paycheck is one of the biggest things that people really love about working for the military. Right now, I'm a Chief, so I make about $4500 per month. Well, I don't make it, I am in the US Navy Reserve but usually on active duty, Chiefs make $4500 per month and they also have this thing called BAH, Basic Allowance for Housing which almost doubles your paycheck. So, you get about like $2500 per month and if you add that up it's about $75000 per year.",What is your pay?,What is Navy pay?,What is your salary?,How much money do you make?,How much money do people make in the Navy?,Will the Navy pay me enough?,,,,
JobSpecific,Navy,How many hours do you work in a typical day?,"The amount of hours that you work in a typical day actually depend on whether you're deployed or not. So, if you're deployed fighting the war, then I'd say 12 hours would probably be the average. On some days you get away with working only eight, that's including Saturdays. Many days, in fact every four days, you're working for a day and a half. So, you stand your eight hours of normal work and then you have your General Quarters, which is actually training at night time for two or three or four hours and then you could have another watch from midnight until six the next day and you could possibly have your normal work day tacked on the end of that. So, you know, some days, if you're really in it, you're working, you know, a day and a half to two. Sundays were my easiest days where I'd only work for six hours and that's like a great day for me. When you are not deployed, then days are a lot easier. You probably get to work around seven and then you leave around noon so that means your days are only five hours or six hours.",What are your hours like?,What are your work hours?,How much do you work while in the Navy?,How many hours do you work?,,,,,,
"JobSpecific, STEM",Navy,What types of problems do you deal with on a daily basis?,"Problems show up every now and then. When you're on active duty, so it kind of depends on whether you're deployed or not. If you're deployed, that means things happen, you know, with any mechanical equipment. So, pumps could break in the middle of the night and then you get waken up and, you know, you have to go fix it. Sometimes you have people that come in drunk, on the weekends and when we were in port, so you'd have to make sure that, like, to get to their bed safely and that they get disciplined later on. Things like that happen on deployment.  When you are not deployed, then you still hear the drunk people coming in, you know, but because you're not, the ship isn't being used over and over and over every single day in and out, problems with the equipment doesn't happen as much. So, you just do preventive maintenance, which means that even though this pump looks fine, you're just going to open it up and check to make sure that the oil is there, and you know, that is at the right temperature and shut it. So, a lot easier time.",What are problems you solve?,How do you solve problems at work?,What are the issues you have to resolve being in the Navy?,What problems do you see regularly?,Do you run into problems?,,,,,
"Lifestyle, Culture",Navy,What kind of issues are there with alcohol in the Navy?,"So, you probably heard of the term 'drunken sailors' and that's for a good reason. Once you are deployed and you pull into a port, which is like a little city of a new country, then the people are very very angsty and they want to get out and, you know, party a little bit. So, you probably been on the ship, in the middle of the ocean, you haven't seen another, you know, non-military soul for about a month. So, they really want to go out there and, you know, like, you know, do the opposite of what they were doing which is being disciplined. Now, they want to, you know, go be young kids. The military's basically eighteen to twenty four year olds. So, kind of like the college life. So, they go out there and do college level things. They find the first bar, they sit with each other and just, you know, find, you know, the cheapest alcohol and you could find them there the whole entire day and then they come back to the ship. The military knows this, so they have people walking around, checking into the bars, making sure they aren't caught causing fights, which they are, make sure that people aren't, you know, drinking too much which they are, make sure that people can make it home safely, you know, which means that they come back by taxi, which means that they come in handcuffs sometimes but it's all in good fun. By the time we leave, out of five thousand people or sometimes eight thousand people that are there, you only have maybe one or two that actually get into real big trouble. I personally didn't, I personally wasn't involved in that drunk culture so much. I actually liked to go out to the town and explore, you know, the museums and the scenery and things like that but I had a few drinks myself too.",Is alcohol an issue?,Can you drink in the Navy?,Are there alcoholics in the Navy?,Do Navy sailors drink a lot?,What happens when sailors get too drunk?,,,,,
Lifestyle,Navy,What is the Navy doing to combat heavy alcohol use?,"As soon as you join the military, probably your very first week, even though you're at bootcamp, so you have no access to alcohol but from that time,you know, all the way up until you end your career, you're going to be hearing about alcohol, alcohol responsibility, the fact that you can't drink too much, the fact that, you know, alcohol ruins people's lives and it's a very big thing for our culture. So, the Navy takes some strides to kind of change this. We get lots of training. We get, for instance, when we go to ports, when we're on deployment, we have this thing called the 'buddy system', which means that you're not allowed to go out yourself. You actually have to tap one of your friends and the both of you go out to explore this new city. They want to make sure that you don't go out there and get yourself into trouble by drinking too much alcohol and then having a stranger, you know, guide you back to the ship. There are people who would rob you, there are people who will, you know, do harm to you. So, the 'buddy system' is probably the Navy's biggest way to combat alcohol misuse.",How is alcohol regulated?,How does the Navy deal with alcohol abuse?,What does the Navy do about alcohol?,Lifestyle,,,,,,
"Lifestyle, Colleagues",Navy,How much did your friends impact where you ended up in your career?,"So, from the day that you join the Navy, you're going to find that you have similar past to people that are in your same field. So, you know, there are people who are very motivated and want to become the Master Chief of the Navy. You have some people who, maybe were criminals before and joined the military to prevent going to jail, to be given a shot for normal life before they winded up in a bad place. So, you have the whole gamut of people and different career paths, different intelligence, different motivations for being in the military. So, in general, people of a similar quality tend to hang out with the same people. So, people who like to drink all the time, you'll find that they're, you know, have this one house that they always go to, over and over. People that are very very motivated study all the time. You'll find that they probably share a house with people who want to become an officer. So, you also find that that's very apparent in the ports that you go to. So, for me, I didn't want to. I wasn't a drinker at that time. Not, not very much. So I'd go into port and I try to tap people like, ""Hey, do you want to go see some place fun?"", ""Do you want to go climb a mountain or visit a castle?

So, I take flights to New York, just, if I feel like it. I take drives to Las Vegas, because it's kind of close to Los Angeles and I also still get to travel a lot because of the US Navy Reserve. So, in the US Navy Reserve, they send you to the four corners of America. We go to New Hampshire, to  Virginia, also to Washington and San Diego.

It's very specialized. So, for instance, as an E1, E2, E3, your whole entire world is to do this technical job, to fix a pump, to paint this wall and you might not see it but making sure that pump is fixed or making sure that wall is painted, makes sure that the ship can run. Making sure that the ship can run, make sure that the officer can fly a jet, making sure that that jet is fixed and that pilot knows his information, make sure that he can drop this bomb, making sure that bomb drops, make sure that the battle is won, making sure that the battle is won, make sure the war is won. So, when you are painting that wall, you don't really see how that is actually helping you win the war in Afghanistan but it does. So, the higher you get in your enlisted pay grade, the more you see that big picture. I'm an E7, so my responsibility is to know how this unit can help the civilians, make sure that this aircraft carrier runs fine and I think as officers, the higher you get, if you're a captain, you make sure that this aircraft carrier fits in this realm of the region so that, like we have power over there, we can dominate our foes.

When we're on deployment, which means that we're out there fighting the war, then they're called all the time.

So, it's not a nine to five job normally. When I was active duty and I wasn't on deployment and I was just stationed at my command, you still work many many cases during night time.

So, if you really love your job, then you'll probably make it a thirty year career if that's possible. I know a lot of people who were like spies, you know, the crypto techs, the people in human relations, the public relations officers, they absolutely love their job and they couldn't think of doing anything else. Some of the people with harder jobs, for instance, the nuclear field, maybe some of the advanced jobs like the E. T.'s or the fire control men, they might be expected to do a little bit more work and they can be a little bit more demanding, sometimes a little bit more frustrating. They have to do more sea tours, so you get to a point where you want to actually live the civilian life that you see many other people are experiencing. So, by the time your six years is up or four years, in some cases, is up, that's a pretty big milestone for you to make for your career and the turnover can be pretty sharp.

Chiefs are the ones who actually tell people what to do. So, they don't need to be told what it is they're supposed to be doing because they only have one job, which is to hand out the work. On the other hand, Officers, has basically the same pay grade, the same direction of flow. So, for instance, an O1, O2, O3, they're told by the higher level people who they're supposed to be managing, ""You're supposed to be tagging along with these people"", or I think for Officers, their main goal is just to be, to train themselves.

I know some people who didn't want to be Machinist's Mates but they were given an option of like three or four jobs, they chose something else and then they were given that Machinist's Mate job anyways. So, at the end of four years, and you have to do your four years, they lived that life, they learned those things, they did that training, they did that job and at the end, then they left and did something else for the civilians.

I could've been an officer and then my lifestyle would have changed or I could have chosen my command later on in my career. That would have changed my lifestyle but it wouldn't have actually changed my job itself.

Like, for instance, Electrician's Mate, I am an E7, so I can do an E7 job, a Chief job that doesn't require Electrician's Mate itself but those are few and far in between. So, once you get out of the military, if that's the choice that you choose to make, then I think that the skills that they provide you, for instance, math and science and taking orders, those can be applied anywhere.

So, they gave all of these positives to join the nuclear field and I got to admit, that actually overshadowed any other job that I wanted to pursue. In A school, you learn, basically graduate level nuclear work, nuclear studies. So, I'd been in college and I went to master's courses and I got to admit, the military is actually more intense than college, than any college that I'd been to. They work you for eight hours per day, they give you lots of tests and it's simple, they always say that nuclear field is as hard as a pre-calc or I'm sorry, a pre-algebra class and that's actually true. Everything is written down for you in easy to read explanations and so if you could read normally as a high school student, for instance, if you got As and Bs and maybe even Cs in high school, then this learning is no problem for you. The difference is, you have to be willing to do it for a long time and if you start lacking, then you need to start doing all the homework that they tell you to do. They're not going to let you fail.

After it got started, I remember that there was a little bit of fear that I had, you know, I didn't know how big this thing was going to be. I definitely didn't know that there was a war that was about to be started but I did realize that, that's when it finally hit me. Before, I thought, the military is a place that you go, you learn some kind of job, you have a nine to five job and you probably clean some things, you work out a little bit but after 9/11 happened, then I realized, ""You know what?"", there's a job that needs to be done and I'm probably going to be the one that's going to need to do this.

"JobSpecific, Motivation",Positive,Why do you love your job?,"So, I'm particularly fond of the military. I joined when I was 21 and I didn't really have that many skills available to me. I graduated high school and I wasn't the best high school grad, you know, many people in the military aren't and I tried college for a while and I was very, on and off again student. I got a few Fs when I was there and because I was working two jobs at the time and you know, my days were pretty full. So, the military actually allowed me to have a semi-regular life, you know, like <not clear>. Because I was taking care myself, because I didn't have the support of my family, the military welcomed me with a job, a place to stay, some cash in my pocket, a skill set and that pretty much, once I got that grounding, then I was able to be very independent, very self sustaining for a long time. So, it's kind of, it took care of me in that way. So, do I love the military? You could say that I do. You know, it's the thing that allowed me to have a college education later on, it's the thing that allowed me to save up so much money and I think I'm doing pretty well for someone my age, so. As far as my job, my job as an Electrician's Mate, I didn't, it's not the job that I really wanted to do at the beginning. I wanted to learn languages and you know, travel the world a lot and I'm a nuclear technician. We weren't really allowed to do that because you're a nuke, you have to stay on the continental United States, So, I couldn't visit, I couldn't be stationed in Germany, I couldn't be stationed in France, which, you know, really, was irritating for me. And, I wasn't a very good engineer. I didn't have the engineering mindset when I joined the military at first. However, I grew to love my job because the training that they give you, they make you a real expert at it. So, once you find a job that you can do, you start doing well and then you start getting awards, you start learning more things on your own and eventually I said, ""You know what? Electrician's Mate is really cool. It's one of the best jobs that you can have in the military.

Misconceptions,Navy,What gets romanticized about your career field that really isn't that great?,"So, I'd have to admit, the military does a very good job of marketing itself to be very, very tough, very strong and very team-oriented. You can drive down any street and if you see a picture for the military, you might see someone in these, in this uniform, but in a very very movie style picture. And it's not always like that. For the most part, we're not soldiers. I'm not a soldier, I'm a sailor which is different than what many people think of the military. When you think, when many people think of the military, they think of a full-metal jacket, you know, with your hard hat, your helmet and, you know, walking around with a gun and to tell you the truth, I've never, you know, picked up a machine gun. The best I got was, like a little laser pointer in bootcamp. Otherwise, I've never, I've never seen a gun. So, the real military is a wide range of jobs. You have people working on the weapon system, you have people talking languages, you have people down in the nuclear plants, you have people that are cooks, you have people showing the jets how to move. But, what's really presented, what's romanticized is the basic soldier, you know, the Army style, the Marine style. So, the Navy's kind of different, in a good way.",What is exaggerated about the Navy?,What do people think is good about your job that really sucks?,How is your job worse than what people think?,,,,,,,
Culture,Navy,What makes the Navy different than other branches of the military?,"The Navy is different than other branches in a lot of different ways but I think, about the second or third year that I was in the military, that I was in the Navy, I saw it as four different types, maybe five if you considered the Coast Guard. So, if you want to be the soldier that you hear about in the movies, then you join the Marines. They work out a lot more, they're the first people that start to fight the war. You have to, you know, be pretty strong and pretty brave, in the other branches too but more so for the Marines. If you want to be similar to the Marines but you want the tough lifestyle, you want the, you know, the rough, rugged fighting but you're more mechanically oriented, then you can try the Army. So, the Army, that's when you drive in tanks, that's when you set up communication systems in the middle of the desert. So, they're kind of Marines but they're not the first ones out there. If you want a, kind of, more civilian style job, then you join the Air Force. Air Force is known that you, it's known that you have some of the best equipment. For instance, at Travis Air Force Base, they have excellent golf clubs. They have, you have basically, a nine to five job. You can, kind of, sit in office many times. It's not always that case. You know, you can find lots of different jobs in any service but this is what was going on in my mind in the second year that I was in the Navy. So, the Navy is different from all of those. So, for instance, when you're on deployment, when you're six months, when you're traveling around in the middle of the ocean for six months, it's not like you're working out every day, also it's not a nine to five job in an office because you're working pretty much like, the whole day, you know, and it's not in an air conditioned office. It's sometimes down in the middle of the plants. The thing that the Navy has going for it is that you should be very technical. You should know your job better than any of your civilian counterparts. So, if you want to be known as someone who's like, pretty bright with when it comes to computers, when it comes to mechanical components, fixing machines, then the Navy is for you.","How does the Navy differ from the Army, Air Force and Marines?",Are the other services like the Navy?,Do the other services compare with the Navy?,How is the Navy different from other services?,,,,,,

Misconceptions,Navy,What do you do in the Navy that is different from what you expected?,"The Navy is very different than what I expected when I joined. I didn't really know that much about the military. My father was in the army and I should have had a better clue than what I did but I never, you know, I barely visited when he was in the army. He just came home and then, you know, took care of us. So, I had that same understanding that most people think about when they hear about them, the military, that is, that you're going to put on the hat, you're going to wear these clothes,you're going to, you know, go to foreign countries and fight wars. So, I did fight wars but I never really visited the country itself. My war was on a ship itself, on an aircraft owned by America. So, I didn't ever go to Iraq, I didn't ever go into Iran, I didn't ever go to Saudi Arabia. I didn't go to those places but I still fought the war, so that's kind of different than what I was expecting. I also bought into the mentality that everyday is going to be like P.T, physical training, good for you, good for me, but you barely work out. You are supposed to keep in shape. So, if you get overweight, then, you know, that could be a problem but for the Navy at least, as long as you meet the standards in the training which happens every six months, they make sure that you're not overweight, that you can do some push-ups and some sit-ups, then you're good to go and some people actually, they kind of skate around the system. So, people are a lot less fit than what I thought I would be doing. I thought I'd be like super buff, you know, model style but it's, that's not really expected of you.",Were you disappointed by your preconceived notions about the Navy?,Did your recruiter tell you something that was not true?,Did you know you'd be doing this kind of work?,How is your work different from what you expected?,Did the Navy job meet your expectations?,,,,,
JobSpecific,Navy,How did your work day change over your career?,"When I started my career, then I was an E3, which is the third rank that you can be in the hierarchy. Not a lot was expected of me. I get to work, they say, ""Go fix this pump"", ""Go work with that guy"" and then at the end of the work day, around like four or five o'clock, then, probably not much was really expected of me. They'd say, you know, ""Just go to your bed"" or ""We'll see you later"". It depends on whether you're on deployment or whether you're stationed at home but you might have to work, maybe one or two hours extra every other day. However, as I progressed, when I became an E6, which is a first class or a Chief which is an E7, then, after that normal work day of telling people what to do, you know, you're there the same exact time as they are, you have to do, like, the follow up at the end. So, for instance, they get done at the end of the day. So, now that you have that information, while they get to go home or they get to, like, you know, have that downtime, you have to go report that to other people. You have to do the paperwork that other people are requiring. So, you have to wait till the normal work is done and then you have to add on the supervisory specialization that you have to give at the very very end. So, you work more as you get higher in the rank.",Compare you day now to when you started?,Is you work day different now?,Did you like the way your work day used to be?,How has your work day changed over a period of time?,Has your work day changed over the years?,,,,,
JobSpecific,Navy,How has your view of this line of work changed over time?,"My view's changed for the military and a couple of ways. The first way is, that I understand the different roles of the military now. Before, I just thought we were just one big group, you go fight a war and I didn't know who did what but now, I see where we stand globally as far as, like, what branches do what service. Aircraft people, they stay pretty much on United States soil and then they send huge ships to do logistics. Marines, they're the ones who keep in really good shape so that they can go and get that first push when we start the war, when we start a battle. We have the Army people who like, provide support to the Marines and they fight themselves too, you know, but they're the ones like, shooting guns and stuff. So, like, you start to learn all of these things and later on, as a supervisor, you get more information about why we are doing things. So, for instance, why we're fighting in Iraq, why we are sending these planes over there and how the aircraft carrier can support them as opposed to like, when you're, you know, fresh on this ship, like, I don't know, I'm just here on this boat. I'm so <word>, fix that pump, that's all I know.

"Travel, Background",Navy,"Where did you have to move in your career, and how did that change things each time?","I moved a lot when I was in the military and I'm really happy about that because you keep hearing about America and how it's different in different places. So, I got to visit the four corners of America and I got to see the different lifestyles. So, I grew up in Alabama which is, like, down south in a black community. Everybody around me, my neighbors, everyone was black and then, you know, you go to school that's mixed but I got to see that. I grew up some of my time in Flint, Michigan which is a very urban place but it's on the poorer side. So, that glove part, you know, I know all about that. And when I joined the military, then my first school was in Charleston, South Carolina which is another down south place but I got to see, you know, it's little bit more mixed. Then I went up to New York, Albany which is nice green country and I got to visit 'The New York City', you know, very often so that was really cool for me, to visit such a famous place. Later on, I got stationed in San Diego and it's super hot, well, it's good temperature, it can be very hot as opposed to New York which was freezing cold and it's a very big city. You know, it's my style of, I'm not a country backwards boy, you know, like, climbing mountains and hunting. I am a city guy myself. So, I got to see San Diego which is, like, I'm from California originally so that's up my tree. And then, I finally got to visit Bremerton, Washington which is in the middle of Washington state and it's kind of country, you can own bigger houses there, you know, for much cheaper. So, it's much less expensive than California and I knew a lot of people who used to be Californians but then they, you know, changed over to Washington because the life is a lot easier. They liked having a five bedroom house with a big green yard for the kids to play in and nice and quiet neighborhoods, you know, so, a lot of people change.

"Fit, STEM, Growth/learning",Navy,Are great practitioners in this field made or born?,"Are great practitioners of this field made or born? I would say that it's a little bit of both. Now, there's some psychology here. I do believe that when you're born, you have certain innate abilities, comes from your mom and your dad, comes from your race. Some of us are different skinned, some of us are taller or shorter, some of us are, you know, stronger based on your genes and I also think that, like, your mind is, it follows the same trait, you know, like everybody's different. Some people are artists when they're born, some people are engineers when they're born. However it depends on how you grow up. So, you can take someone who's an artist as a kid and then you can train them through their lives to become a great engineer. Now, maybe they might not be the best engineer because it's not in their bodies but they can do a good job, a great job in fact. So, it's a combination of both. It depends on who your mom and your dad were. Hopefully, you got that training, whatever training that you want to be and later on in your life but if you don't, the military, who realizes this, can train anybody to do anything. So, some people will have to do a lot more work to achieve their goals. Some people can, for instance, join the nuclear field like I am and it can be a breeze for them.

"Priorities, STEM, Advice",Navy,What priorities would you recommend for a person entering this field?,"Some of the priorities that I would suggest for someone entering the field, well, me personally, once I found out that I was going to become a nuke, become a nuclear technician, I guess I wasn't going to, for about seven months or eight months, so I took some community college classes to, kind of, brush up on some of the physics, some of the math and I have to tell you, that was a very big benefit. I didn't know anything about physics, like, for instance, I didn't know like, what happened with gravity and shooting bullets and stuff and some common things that I would have gotten wrong but because I took those college classes, that helped me prepare myself better to do well in A school. Because I did well in A school that, you know, like, set me off on a big career path later on. But it's not just like, nuclear technician, it could be, for instance, electronics technician. You might want to brush up on some of your voltage and your current and your resistors. You could be a cook. You might want to brush up on, like, the different specialties of the flavors that you're going to be using or you know, ask some other cooks out there, like, ""What does it take to be good at my job?""

"JobSpecific, Management",Navy,How fair are the expectations of you as an employee?,"So, the fairness in the Navy, it, I have to say that the military is fair. However, they have some intricacies that I have to say. So, for instance, let's say the economy does poorly. Then the President is to blame. Now, no one's going to say, well, ""You know, President, you are the one that caused that entire city to be downgraded."" It wasn't his job, you know, like, maybe it's the President before him. However, he takes responsibility for it. So, there's a lot of responsibility taking for things that you don't directly control but because it was under your guidance, you are the one that, who people look to, whether it was your fault or not. So, if for instance, my military unit has many people that aren't physically fit, then they're going to say, ""Chief, what is wrong with your unit?"" Now, I don't have any excuse. I could say, well, ""You know, I tell them to work out and they just don't listen."" I could grab them by the collar and like, try to run with them but in the end, the people that are working for you, it's their, it's under their cognizance and you just take responsibility for it. So, is that fair?

So, even in boot camp, some of the tasks that they provide for you, that they ask you to do are kind of complex. So some people, let's say they were really good in high school. It can be very easy for them, they understand the math that's involved, they understand how how the physics works, how to tie the knot. But for some people it could be the first time that they've ever seen it in their lives. Maybe they've never even been on a ship before you know so be a lot harder for them. So, the cool thing about the navy is that it gives you all the resources that you need, hands down. So if you don't need it then you probably won't use it but if you do need it then it's all a matter of asking a chief ""Hey where can I get help"" or a matter of going to your local library and getting that book. The biggest thing is that there's gonna be someone to your left and someone to your right that can work with you hand in hand to make sure that you complete your job. But what the Navy doesn't want is someone who can't do their job who is trying to do their job because that's gonna get someone killed. So they make sure that whether it's tying a knot or painting a ship or it's going down and fixing the pump they're gonna make sure that you can complete your job and if there's any question to it then they're not gonna allow you to do it so.",Can I move up?,Does everybody have a chance to get promoted?,Is there always something new to learn and master?,,,,,,,
Management,Navy,How satisfied have you been with your bosses in your career?,"The bosses that I've had in the navy have been varied. Some of them I've got along with greatly but others they- in many cases it it depends on the type of personality that they have and just like with anyone, somtimes you make friends sometimes you make enemies if you can say that. So most people are just somewhere in the middle so the people that you would have a beer with in real life, those the people you can joke around with, those are the people that understand your personality and they're the ones who respect your work the best. However I gotta say that many people think that the military can be political, so for instance you could have a work center that has like four or five people and then you can have a supervisor for them and you can see that the supervisor has a better communication with you know two or three people in the unit. So the quiet person who barely ever talks to that supervisor could get frustrated in the fact that his work isn't being recognized the way that it should. So I've had that personal problem too. But it is what it is. You just take an average of your whole entire career. Sometimes you will be a superstar and sometimes you are gonna be kinda like the bottom of the list. But for the most part as long as you you present a good effort then you'll be successful. I made it to chief, so it seems like most of what I've been doing with my bosses has been on the positive side.",Is you leadership competent?,Are officers helpful or are they pests?,Do people senior to you screw with you all the time?,,,,,,,
"STEM, JobSpecific",Navy,Describe the technological environment in which you've worked.,"So some of the technology that I worked on in my career as a nuclear technician, it's kind of divided into two parts because the nuclear technology field is divided into two parts. The first one is electrical things, I'm an Electrician's Mate, so I used many components like a watt meter, a volt meter, oscilloscope these are all equipment that you use to touch things around the plant to get readings on them. See what their oil level is, see what they're voltage is, see what the current is, see what the power is. So they're really used all throughout America as electricians as use them. The other part of my job, the nuclear technology field, is very specific most of the time. But if you think of Homer Simpson, he was a nuclear technologist. It only deals with things that the uranium cycle can do to make power. So some of things that I worked on deal with the nuclear part of the aircraft carrier and the way that it makes the ship run. So for instance it makes electricity. So for instance I worked with turbine generators. The nuclear technology of the aircraft carrier makes steam, so the steam will power lots of different things all around the ship. So all of the valves that it takes to make sure that the steam goes to the right places, so that a spin pumps, or to move the screws of the aircraft carrier so that it can move through the water. All of those are things I dealt with as far as technology.",What is the technology around you every day?,Do you work with a lot of technical equipment?,Do you work with fancy gear or just regular tools?,Do you work in a lab or on-site?,,,,,,
"STEM, Future",,What is your opinion on nuclear energy and its future?,"With nuclear energy, maybe because I have a bias because I went through the program but what's really pushed upon us is that it's very safe. It's one of the safest ways to make energy that we have. Now there is a concern about nuclear waste and of course you know we have nuclear waste at the end of an aircraft carrier's life cycle, but it's controlled in a certain spot and we put in the middle of the ground as opposed so let's say charcoal which produces fumes in the air as opposed to sunlight which doesn't provide the energy for the surface area that it has , to produce as much as the nuclear power that is. As opposed to wind which requires these big things in far off places. So nuclear technology can be built anywhere in a safe manner, and in fact the navy has a history of zero incidents of nuclear failures in the navy's history, so we're really proud of that. I think that nuclear technology should be the way to go for our future energy needs; however, I do understand people's hesitation with taking on nuclear power, especially with the thing that happened in Japan-the great Japanese earthquake in 2001. So it's been a big problem to try to pick up all of the all the pieces there. They still have problems with it, even though it has been you know like eight years later. However that took a huge natural disaster to cause a problem that day, so whether it's charcoal whether it's sunlight you know no matter what, when you have a big earthquake like that then that is going to happen but otherwise nuclear power is one of the safest ways to make energy that I know of, and that's what we are taught.",Do you think this field will be around for years or go away?,Are you happy working in this field?,Don't you think this work is dangerous to everyone?,,,,,,,
Culture,Navy,What organizations were most helpful to you in your career?,"The organizations most helpful to me number one has to be the military healthcare system so I think I hurt my thumb I also sprained my foot really bad and one thing that you don't really have to worry about being in the military is the top of this head to the bottom of your feet- it's all taken care of. You might have to pay a little bit more for your family but other than that the rates are really cheap and it's very convenient. Another thing that I think of, another association I think of when I think of the military that is actually on the fun level is MWR. Without MWR I would have a hugely different impression of the military but they throughout my whole entire career if I ever wanted to play pool, if I ever wanted to bowl, if I ever wanted to go hiking, skiing, camping, they were right there with super friendly people to make sure that our work outside of our hard military life is rewarded. And finally I have to give my credit to the USO. Whenever I go to an aircraft carrier they're the nicest sweetest people. They give me hot dogs, cakes, cookies, they provide me a place to sleep, they allow me to put my bags down, especially when I want to walk around the aircraft carrier without being over burdened. I see other people out there waiting in these long lines, back up against the wall with the kids and then I see the USO people and their military families having the time of their lives even though it's a five hour flight. So hats off to USO.",What organizations are important to your work?,Do you have a professional society?,Should I join any professional groups?,,,,,,,
Jargon,Navy,What is MWR?,"MWR stands for morale, recreation, and welfare. That's basically the military's leisure association, you go in there you can ask them anything from hiking equipment, camping equipment, maybe they can show you a place to shoot guns. If you're in a foreign country they can tell you all the different places around %HESITATION that you can %HESITATION enjoy yourself. So for instance in San Diego, they told us where Disneyland is, Seaworld, %HESITATION how to go to Mexico safely, how to go to Las Vegas, all the things that are around San Diego. They also give you cheaper rates than civilians can get. So basically if you're in any place that has MWR that's the first place to go when you want to try to do something fun out in the community.","What does morale, welfare and recreation do?",Who takes care of your having a good off-duty life?,Is MWR a Navy organization?,,,,,,,

They come and they volunteer their time to show their respect to the military in lots of ways. The way that I know is that they're at airports and they have a little building off to the side or maybe they're on the second level of the airport where you can go in and you can rest, you can eat some of their food, you can have conversations with other people on similar flights, and it's really convenient. I'm sure that they do other things as well so I wanna give them credit for that but the way that I know them is from their support at the airports.",Is USO the group that puts on shows for GIs and Sailors?,What does USO stand for?,Is USO part of your life?,,,,,,,
"Risk, JobSpecific",Navy,What kind of risks do you need to take in this field?,"You might want to try to develop yourself into the best sailor that you can be, and when you do that, when you want to try to do that, that means that you have to take on jobs that aren't usually easy. So it all began when I joined the join the military. At first I had the opportunity to take normal jobs, slightly higher jobs, and in their most advanced field, nuclear technology. So that's what I chose to do. I didn't take the easy route in that case and for me it worked out really well. As I became a nuclear technician then lots of jobs start popping up for you so again you have to decide well do I want to have an easy life, have a normal nine to five job. Do I want to go home at the end of the night or should I try this supervisory position that you hear that they have to stay on the ship later, they have more responsibly put on them, they're blamed a lot more for things. So basically you have to make your life worse some people would say, but I think it's just more responsible. Just like with any job the more responsibility you take, the more risks you have of getting in trouble now because you're taking care of this work center your blamed for that work center if something goes wrong. However if you can do your good job and have that work center be better because of you. You tell the people what to do and they have less of incidence of failure you bring your boss down there and say well this is the way it used to be but I told this person to do X, this person to do Y and now this person is better because of that. So now that supervisor that's in front of you will give you an award for that so the only way to progress yourself, to become a chief, senior chief, master chief, is to put yourself in that role to take on those risks of failure and ultimately reap the rewards.",Is this dangerous?,Do you sometimes have to take chances?,Has this job ever made you feel insecure?,,,,,,,
"Education, Growth/learning, Advice",Navy,Should I go to college before or after serving?,"I went to college after I did the military. I think that's one way to do it, but you have a wide range of opportunities for college. If you ask if you should go to college before you start serving that depends on what you wanna do. If you wanna have a very good enlisted career, and you don't plan on becoming an officer then I suggest that you join the military right away. Officers need a college degree, so if you get the college degree first then you can become an officer as soon as you join the military. You can apply to become an officer and every year thereafter, however you probably wouldn't start your career four years later. So that could be a hindrance if you wanna have a full enlisted career. For people that aren't sure what the what they want to do, I still suggest that they join the military right away because you can go to school while you're in the military. I took a few classes myself. So if you decide that college isn't for you then you didn't waste those four years. Also military college can be free in many cases. It can be very very cheap, they have the tuition assistance that can reduce the price by a few thousand dollars or ultimately make it free and you can down take lots of classes during your off time. So that means you can kill two birds with one stone, you can get the work experience and you can do college at night time. For some people like me, I didn't want the military work to interfere with my school. I wanted to get As, so that's why even though I wanted to go to school the entire time that I was in the military, I waited until I got out so I could use the Montgomery GI Bill, so I could go to a very expensive university, and so that I could really focus on my school without worrying about work in the middle. So between going to school in the beginning if you want to become an officer, going to school during your career if you're thinking about making the military a career itself, or doing college at the very end, so you can enjoy the Montgomery GI Bill, the post 9-11 benefits, and all the free stuff. You have to decide where you fit in that range.",College first or later?,Will the Navy let me go to college while on active duty?,Do college grads do better in this kind of work?,,,,,,,
"Impact, JobSpecific","Navy, Positive",How can your work change the world?,"I think that that the navy change the world, the military can change the world, and ultimately America can change the world if we use the money that we are spending for the military wisely. So America spends I think six hundred billion dollars per year, which is from what I understand several times more than any other country. It's maybe the next six countries combined total, that's what the military spends. So what are we using that money for I would say that it's policing the world. We make sure that we have a huge military so that there aren't huge fights breaking out all over the world like it used to be two hundred three hundred years ago because there wasn't a main force. Then you have England attack France, Iraq attack Saudi Arabia, I'm making up countries but you understand that there wasn't a global force for good making sure that everybody isn't going crazy with all the attacking. So yes America does attack itself too and there's an ideology behind that. But ultimately as long as America can control the huge fights that break out then I'd say that people for the most part in most countries will appreciate that protection that we are providing.",Is your work important to all of us?,Will you work help or hurt us?,Will the future be better because of your work?,,,,,,,

The ideology that I'm talking about is the fact that you need to be able to follow instructions. So for instance if you always got in trouble all the time and you can't follow directions, then that is a hit. A lot of people that would have went to jail still join the military because the judge thinks that they have the potential to follow directions if in the right situation. So the biggest quality that recruiters look for when they ask people to join the navy is ""Will you do what I tell you to do? Will you do what your supervisor tells you to do? Are you going to be drunk and get kicked out of military right away?""

We can see that the policing that we're doing isn't fully effective in the way that we are seeing decreases in the level of violence around the world. We are seeing the same or even more than when I was in the military, so that could be something that we can look forward to in the military from now on.",what are the hot button issues in this line of work?,what worries most people about this work area?,what are some issues for people working in this field?,What are some problems that people who work in this field face?,What are some problems that you face?,,,,,

I said you know, I'm going to into this five star hotel you know, gambling on the bottom and I said I can stop. Ten thousand dollars that's enough for a car. I will come back and I won't gamble anymore I'll go out into the world. I had this trick that I could do for roulette which is like you take one dollar and if you lose it then you bet two dollars, if you lose it then you bet four dollars, if you lose then you bet eight dollars and eventually you're gonna win you know. Even if you lose lose lose lose lose lose lose lose lose, if you win on that tenth time as long as you keep doubling then you get all your money back and you know. So anyways I tried this trick. So we went to Australia and I was down in the bottom of the hotel and I was there for maybe seven hours six hours on my roulette wheel. So I started off with a hundred, I actually did Black Jack and I got into like two three hundred and I started roulette you know with my special trick and I got it up to two thousand dollars. So I'm like ""ah I'm on my way you know it actually does work.""

So she was gambling on the hundred dollar chip tables and before I was doing like ten, ten dollar tables so I was like you know what? Here is my money let me go ahead and you know try to get this ten thousand dollars as fast as possible. So I go to right beside her, you know she is the only one at the table. Start betting hundred dollars, hundred dollars, hundred dollars. It's all gone. Whoop- bye two thousand dollars.

"STEM, Background",,What do you do in computer science/programming?,"Computer science is broken up into basically two different forms. The first one is computer science itself, which is everything that's associated with the laptop that's in front of you. That includes the theory that's behind it, the abstractions that are associated with thinking about the way that you know, computers should work. That involves the electronics that are behind it, you open up the computer and you can see the mother board, you can see the resistors, you can see the current that's traveling through it. So that's the hardware portion, that's the thing that's on the screen that deals with web design that deals with the way that the colors look, also graphics. That's how the light comes from the computer and hits your eyes. There's the user experience part which is when you have buttons all over the screen, and maybe this button shouldn't be like here, maybe people want it bigger or smaller, maybe they want it on the other side screen. Maybe they think that it's boring, but if you change it in a certain way so that it's more fun. So that's, all of that combined is computer science. But what most people think about when they think of computer science is actually the coding part. Coding is what happens when you have your laptop open, you open up a program and you start pushing buttons on your computer screen to write lines of code so that when you compile it, you press play, it does something for you. So for instance you can make a game, you compile the game and all of a sudden you can play the game. Or you can make, you can start coding and then when you press play, you have Microsoft Word based on the code that you wrote.

These are things that I've experienced and I gotta say you know, as much as, as strong as I want to be for saying you know, it didn't affect me I'm strong but I think that you know, it really changed my life and I know that a lot of people, especially ones that join the military have had similar careers you know my story is not unique. So I think one of the things that has helped me in order to look at my past better is to have different experiences. Another thing that I'm proud of is the fact that my dad was in the army and I got to go to Germany. So just being in that other environment, being surrounded by German kids, needing to speak the German language, you know eating bratwurst you don't like, having that different experience allowed me to come back to Flint and say you know, this isn't life, this is one part of life, but there are people in Florida that are you know going to Disneyland, people in Germany you know doing Octoberfest, there are people in Japan you know eating Ramanan watching anime. This is just one small sliver, and if you can somehow escape from that environment, or even maybe do something within that environment to make it better you know, then you can see that you don't have to be disheartened by your, by your surroundings.

Yeah I wasn't very sociable as a kid, but something else that I did that actually changed it, I don't suggest this but this is what happened for me, and it stopped me from being bullied, was that I changed myself. I realized that after I put in contacts and took off my glasses, and I start working out you know, I was working out, I was on the track and field club so I ran all the time and I could notice my muscles getting bigger, my chest you know I could shake them. I had a six pack you know, I realized that after I did that, all of the bullying stopped. I don't suggest that because you should be whoever you want to be. I mean because I didn't change myself like that to stop the bullying, I changed myself because that's the person that I wanted to be, you know. I liked not having glasses you know hurt my nose, I liked working out because you know it made me more energetic, but %HESITATION whether you stay yourself or whether you have a different personality or you know you change your look or your feel, all that doesn't matter.

"STEM, Jargon",,What is a regulator?,"So a regulator, it has different meanings depending on what type of job you're doing. So if you ask a mechanic what a regulator is, it's something that regulates some kind of flow. So for instance you could have water going in this direction and then you maybe turn a switch or apply some, some setting to a control mechanism that separates it into different, different paths. So let's say need a little bit of water and you have a lot of water over here then you regulate it so that only a little bit flows out. But let's say you need lots of water here, then you regulate it so that there's lots of water that comes out. So the same thing happens with an electrician, my job. We have voltage regulators so let's say you have a pump that needs twenty volts and you have a machine that can provide all of that, you just don't wanna pump all of the current from that machine into that little, little box, right. So you have a regulator that provides the right voltage so that that voltage will just allow the correct current to go through that machine.

So maybe you were a car mechanic before and you're trying to apply for this mechanical job, then you're gonna talk about the other teammates on your car engineer team that you talk to, that you provided support to, that you supervised, and obviously the dates so that they can see that you have a big range of experience with that.",What should be included in a resume?,What are some of the things that must be on a resume?,What can I not afford to exclude from my resume?,How should my resume look like?,What is needed in a resume?,,,,,

I was working on making speech more understandable for a computer as you talk to it, so that was really good. So I think the Department of Defense, I think you just Google DOD internships and press enter and then there's, probably the whole first there's lots of different postings for you. So at every military installation, let's say in California at Corona, at San Diego, at SWRMC (South West Regional Maintenence Center), at even the San Diego Naval base.

"Advice, Fit",,What do you advise me to do in picking the right career field for me?,"The best information that I could give you if you're trying to understand what you should do for your future career is to learn as much information about it as possible. So for me I joined the nuclear technician field and I didn't even know what they did. I thought we were going to be working on nuclear bombs and I think if I would have known a little bit more about it then I would've had better jump start for my career. So for instance if I knew about like, that the nuclear technology field dealt with the internals of making nuclear power with uranium, then I would study more about that, and my schooling would had a better, I would've understood my schooling a lot better. If I would have picked up a little bit of electrician knowledge beforehand, like for instance, I had no idea what the difference between voltage and current was until I was midway in my A school, my initial school learning. So it would be really nice if I would have understood some of those basic concepts before I started the school. My grades would have been higher, I would have gotten more awards, maybe I would've understood the material, the complex material that was being presented to me in a much, in a much better way if I would've had like fifty or sixty percent knowledge beforehand. So I wouldn't have missed out on all of those like. those minor advanced topics during class.

"Advice, Fit, Motivation",,How do I find what I love to do?,"Trying to find what you love to do, it has two brought answers for me. The first of which is you hear this very often, follow your passion. So personally my passion was music and art. I wasn't an engineer person per se, when I was a kid all the way up until a couple years after I joined the navy. That's right, I joined as an engineer and I wasn't an engineer until after I got to my first ship. I, to tell you the truth, I didn't even like it too much. I like talking languages, and you know conversing with people, and you know writing stuff, and typing on the computer. I did not want to see oil, I did not want to touch a wrench you know, that wasn't for me, but in the end, it brings me to my second point. Try to become really good at the skills that you possess. So for me, I think I'm a good electrician. I became a supervisor after some time, and it's not because I had a passion for electrician things, it's because I found that I was good at it, and that gave me motivation to learn more and more about it, and once I started doing that then it became easy for me. And after it becomes easy for you, then you can start explaining things really well, you can start reading a book and learning more about it really well, you start getting awards for it, you start you know wanting to know more about it.

You can always go down but in many cases it's very hard to go up. So for instance if you pick a simple job like let's say picking plants. I don't mean to discredit any plant pickers out there, but if your job is to pick plants, and then all of sudden you want to be a computer scientist, let's say, it might be hard to try to make that switch. You don't have the skills to do computer science, you don't have the background, you might not have the right way to think about the world.

The best thing to do would be to ask someone who's been in the military, and the longer the time the better.

It wasn't an internship it was just research for UC Berkeley, and I thought I was going to do electrical engineering, but they had so many cool computer science topics and professors and little things around campus that really empowered me to kind of consider computer science as a career. So when I went back home, when I was done with the research and I went back home, I really focused on my computer science classes and I just realized, hey you know out of all the classes that I am learning, math, science, english, the computer science classes were some of the most fun, and I just thought you know, if I want to make my own business, if I was doing electrical engineering I'd have to go to radio shack, I'd have to buy resistors, I'd have to spend lots of money, I'd have to like spend lots of time.

And I kept coming back to the thinking you know what, the military is a good way to start. I knew about their money for education, I knew about, after you do your tour you could have a really good professional career outside of the military you know. So these things were in the back of my mind. Unfortunately, I tried to join in high school and my eyesight is really bad, so they had disqualified me from joining. So I spent two years outside of high school trying to you know make my way through community college, make my way through various odd jobs, and it just wasn't for me.

I know about lots of things that I had never even considered myself interested in before. So does that help me, in a sense, I think it does. It gives me a better perspective. Would I do it over again? So the thing that I'm lacking from doing my nuclear technology path, is I don't have a long history with computer science. So I think if I would have joined like for instance the IT field, the information technology field, then after eight years I'd be really really bright about computer science and networks and what's going on in the, on the interior of a computer.

One day it was like really hot, we had been out to sea for a month, two months, people were getting antsy. So we had a swim call. So what happened was our aircraft carrier was, it came to a full stop, we had navy seals in boats around the water with guns to shoot sharks, and we could jump from the elevator, the aircraft elevator, which is really far far up. It's about like a five or six second drop, once you drop over the edge. It's kinda like a diving board. So you jump over the edge, you go down in this beautiful bath water, and keep going then it gets really cold, then you come back up and it's warm again, and then you're supposed to swim to the back of the ship. So it's about another maybe, minute more to go to the back, and then you have to get out. So it's not like you can like hang out there you know swim, throw a frisbee around, like play volleyball or anything. It's like you jump across, go down in the water, and then you come out, and you swim to the back. You can do that many times you know, but I did it once just to see. I think I actually did it twice.

So the requirements for boot camp are you have to jump into some water and you can't hold on to anything, you have to be afloat for two minutes, and then you come back up. So if you don't know how to do that then there are some, there's a little bit of practice that you can do, and so basically everybody passes.

We didn't swim we rode on the boat right, but around the Arabian gulf, around the surrounding islands, maybe around Singapore. And just in that general area while the war was going on and we stayed there for six months, and then we come back home to San Diego.

So you have to like tweak and optimize the things that are, that you tell the computer to do to make it. So all that's very very difficult. However, some of computer science is really really easy I know that some people who had never done computers at all, can you know study for a week or two, and then put things on the computer like web design or something. So then based on what they learn over the next like a few weeks they can actually make a career out of that, and that's computer science as well.

So for instance it would probably be the people beside me when I was going to school. That would be like maybe the teachers or the instructors. Once I got to my first ship it would probably be the chiefs and the senior chiefs who kind of gave me at least some kind of motivation to be like them. They didn't really teach me, well I didn't get the advice from the things that they showed me, but it's more like the way to be a chief, the way to be in the military you know. That part is like more valuable for me wanting to stay in the military and keep in the military rather than like this is how you charge an electrical device or something like that so. After I got out of the military, I actually was looking more towards the people not even in the military. So I'm in USC's, University of Southern California's Institute for Creative Technologies, and I've gotten a lot of really good advice for my military career from people who aren't even in the military themselves. Just because they have, they understand what it takes to be in the military and where the future of the military lies. And kind of without that advice, I guess I wouldn't think about the military in a civilian type of way. So I'm really thankful to all three of them, the instructors, the chiefs and senior chiefs, and the civilians who had an influence on my life and my military career.","who was your ""go to guy"" regarding your career?",who was you best career counselor?,what person helped you the most to get where you are today?,,,,,,,

And if you can try to you know live up to that movie stereotype, then that would work very well with your superiors because the key word, the only word that really matters for the military is teamwork, and the more that you can show that you're a team, the more that you can like relate to your peers, then that would look really good with your superiors.",how do people learn to get along with their bosses?,is there away to avoid trouble with your bosses in this field?,how can I create good relations with senior personnel?,how do I make good relationships with management?,,,,,,

When you just join the military, they know you don't make that much cash, so what they do is they, some people they have to make them stay on the ship you know to sleep. After you make it to around like E5, the second class petty officer level, then they start giving you this thing called B.A.H. It's basic allowance for housing. They say if you choose to, you're allowed to find an apartment out in the world and we'll give you money for it. In other locations if you're second class petty officer, then they might allow you to stay in the houses on base. Especially if you are staying in a foreign country then you know you're probably staying on base. As you get a lot higher in rank, like for instance if you're a chief, senior chief, or master chief or if you're an officer, then they probably give you lots of cash and they probably allow you to find a much bigger house.

One was Charleston, South Carolina, then I moved up to Albany, New York, then I moved down across the country to San Diego. Then I moved up from there to Birmington, Washington. Now they all had a different flavor. One was a really good climate with lots of people, that's San Diego. Birmington was kind of more to the countryside, but you can have bigger houses and you can do hiking and skiing you know  but it got pretty cold and rainy. New York was close to New York City, but Albany is lots of green trees everywhere you know. The houses are really big, but nothing was around that area. There was no building more than like five stories high you know, that's Albany for you so it's a very quiet town. And in Charleston, South Carolina I guess it's kind of like old style, and more south.

"Military, Travel",Navy,Did the Navy give you a chance to live overseas?,"So the Navy did provide some opportunities for me to live overseas, I just never like really capitalized on it. So my job is a nuclear technician, and unfortunately we're only allowed to stay domestic. However they do give you opportunities to change your roles. Not your job, I'll always be an Electrician's Mate, but your roles throughout your career, they understand that they can't just put somebody on a boat you know for twenty years and think that he'll retire. He'll go crazy, right? So after your tour of maybe four years, then they provide you some opportunities to do different type of work. So they can send you to a shore command, let's say in San Diego where you can kinda like just chill at one of the facilities there, no boats, just a nine to five job. They also, they offered me to go to Italy to work on a sub tender, which is kinda like being on a little boat, you get lots of port calls and stuff so that's one opportunity to go overseas, but if you do like four years on an aircraft carrier, then a couple more years on another boat, that's a lot of sea time. So that was one opportunity for me. They also had another aircraft carrier that was stationed in Japan, it was called the USS Kitty Hawk. However it like, that's where I was going to go, I was in camp like let you know four places in America or send me to Japan? I'm going to Japan, that's where I'm going to go you know, but nah unfortunately we weren't able to go on that.

"Military, Growth/learning, Recognition",Navy,What was your promotion track throughout your Navy service?,"So everybody joins the military as an E1 in boot camp, regardless of your rate. So once you join the military you get some kinds of incentives to join, so being a nuclear technician we're allowed to become E3s immediately. But in boot camp everyone's E1. So as soon as boot camp ended, then I was promoted to a fireman, which is the the engineering side of E3 right, and I did that for school, I was in school for six months, and by the time I graduated that school after six months, I was promoted to a first class petty officer, which is E4. Then I was, I went to nuclear power school, and then prototype training. They're both six months and six months, then I went to my first ship. Now when I finally got to my first ship, that's when I had been in for two years and also because of my rate, nuclear technician, they offered us to automatically be promoted to second class petty officer, that's E5. And that's what I did, they offered us some cash, I got forty thousand dollars in cash, and it was tax free because we were fighting the war and I got automatically promoted to E5. So up until that time that for the first two years I'd always been automatically promoted either by school or just by joining, or just by signing a contract for an additional two years. That automatic promotion to E5 was because I extended my contract from six years to eight years. After that time, after that two years, then I was, I got promoted four years later to E6. So I was promoted E5 in 2002 promoted E6 in 2006, and then I guess I spent two more years in the military, and then I got out after eight years as an E6, which is first class petty officer. Then I made chief, which is what I am now, E7 in 2010, so that's four more years after. So again the time line is I joined boot camp, that's E1, after boot camp, which is about three months, then I was E3, a year and a half later I was, I'm sorry six months later I was E4, at my two year point I was an E5, and then four years later I was an E6, and four more years after that I was E7, chief.",how have you advanced in the Navy?,tell me about you ranks or rates in the Navy.,can you characterize your career path?,how have you progressed in rank?,how did you get to be a chief?,,,,,
"Military, Money",Navy,What was your salary throughout your Navy service?,"So my salary obviously it changes every time I get promoted. It also changes every two years, so the longer that you're in the military you get a little bit more money. So right now I'm a chief and it depends on which, which city you live in, which is gonna dictate your BAH your basic allowance for housing, but everybody makes the same basic pay. So my basic pay right now is $4,500 per month, if I were to be active active duty service, and I also get another couple thousand dollars are for my BAH which is the money that they give you for housing. So all in all it's about $75,000 per year with 16 years in. A person who just barely comes in, he's not going to get, he or she is not going to get that BAH. They will probably just be living on a ship or something like that, and as far as the basic pay, it's probably just a couple thousand dollars maybe $3,000 when you talk about outside of boot camp. So it's about $35,000 to start. So one year in the military you're at $35,000, 16 years you're at $75,000, and that's from an E1 to a chief, it ramps accordingly.",what's the pay like?,how much have you earned?,can I see what people get paid in the Navy?,what do sailors get paid?,how much does the military pay?,do you make a lot of money?,what is the average salary?,,,
"Military, Jargon",Navy,Can you explain the ranking system E and numbers?,"The military is divided up into two parts. You have the enlisted and you also have the officers. Officers are people who have been to college, who have a degree, and who have been awarded a commission, which means their job is to take care of people, their job is to have a command underneath them. So the people that they hire are called the enlisted people. Enlisted people just have to have a college degree or, sorry not college degree, a high school degree or a GED, and then you're able to join the military. You're sent to a vocational school, it's called A school, and from that time then you are actually like the performer, the technical person, the person who drives the ship, or the person who makes the pump, or the person who checks the voltage. So the officers are the people in charge, the enlisted people are the ones who do it. So the enlisted people have a ranking from E1 to E9. An E1 is, it could be, well there are three types. There are the people that deal with aircraft things, people who deal with ship type things, and then people who are engineers. So the engineers are called firemen, the ship type people are called seamen, and the airforce jet type people are called airmen. So there's airmen recruit, then you go airman apprentice, and then you have just a regular airman for E3. That's E1, E2, and E3. After that, E4, E5, and E6, those are called petty officers, so E4 is called third class petty officer, E5 is second class petty officer, and E6 is first class petty officer. And then you have three more which is are chiefs. So I'm an E7 which is a chief and they have a slightly different emblem for their uniform. They're all gold and you can see that this is an anchor. So if you just have this, that's a chief, if you have a star right here that's a E8, that's a senior chief. If you have two stars right here, that's a master chief. So again, E1, E2, E3, petty officer, third class, second class, and first class, and then chiefs: chief, senior chief, master chief.

O4 is Lieutenant Commander. O5 is Commander.O6 is a Captain and Captains are the ones, they're basically really really high in their officer community. They're the people that command the ship, command the aircraft carrier, those are Captains. After that, then you have people who have been Captains for a long time and they're super senior people that you see on TV, those are the Admirals. So you have Rear Admiral Lower Half, Upper Half, Vice Admiral and Admiral.

"Military, Lifestyle",Navy,What were your living quarters like in the Navy?,"For me the living quarters in the navy are outstanding. A lot of people that join they think well it is my first place that I've been staying you know. So like no matter what it is, they'll have a lot of complaints but I realize, I grew up in Flint, Michigan you know, so the fact that they gave me a nice clean bed with clean furniture and a desk right there you know, and that's all they give, and a closet you know. It looks like a tiny little hotel you know, like kind of a cheap hotel, but for me that's you know and the fact that it's free like really blew my mind away. So the other place that you can stay at, for instance the Navy Gateway Inn, or the Navy lodge, they're some of the highest quality hotels that you can find. For instance I was in Hawaii a couple of years ago and I stayed at like this expensive like $300 hotel, and it was nice you know there's a bed, king size bed and you know. But then you stay at the Navy lodge down the street and it's like a huge room with nice fans and there's like, the bedroom has its own door. The bathroom is like you can swim in it, you know you go outside and there's like three couches and there's like TVs for every room, it's crazy. It has its own separate kitchen so like they realize that you know the military people that are traveling across the country, they need a nice place to stay. So it's some of the best places that I've stayed at. Now the place that the military provides for the sailors, it's very quaint. But those places that you go on for vacation, or the places that the Admirals stay at, or the places that you have to pay for that's not, that isn't for official work, they're some of the nicest in America.",how are the living quarters?,are the barracks nice?,did you like living on a ship?,are the rooms cramped?,what is the quality of Navy housing?,Is Navy lifestyle similar to college?,,,,

So I say that the common crime is drinking alcohol, but that's not a crime in itself. The other things are kind of collateral damage, so yeah if you're on a ship for a year, then you will see that somebody has robbed, one person on the ship has robbed somebody out there in the world, you will hear about four fights, five fights that got people demoted, and you will hear about three drunk driving's.

"Military, Money, Benefits",Navy,Did you receive a monetary bonus for enlisting?,"You can receive a cash bonus if you enlist depending on the needs of the Navy. So if we're about to fight a war, or if we're in the middle of a war, then you can expect that they're trying to increase the size of the military, and for that then they provide a bonus. If there, if it's kinda peacetime or if they're downsizing the Navy, then obviously they offer less. So it's a size shaping tool that the Navy has to get people to come in and leave. With that said, in most cases for their advanced jobs, they almost always have some kind of incentive. It ranges in the amount, but it's there nonetheless. So the amount that I received, they gave me the choice, they said I could have $12,000 in cash, you know minus taxes, or you could have a really big educational bonus. It was $50,000. So I knew I was going to go to college and I wanted to make sure that I didn't you know like spend the money early so I said give me the educational bonus at the end. A lot of people that I knew like I guess the first year I was in you know, people had new cars they put down payments on like nice musical equipment and stuff like that. So some other jobs that you could have that provide bonuses, are obviously a lot of the STEM jobs. So there's Electrician's Mate, that's not inside the nuclear field but just regular electricians. There's Fire Controlmen FC's. So those are the ones who fix like all of the, from the engineering plants up. That mean's like the top part of the ship, not dealing with the nuclear side, just from engineering and up you know. They have to be pretty bright too, so they get bonuses. And Cryptological Technicians that learn languages, they're the spies, the ones who like listen, try to find out what foreign people are are up to, they get cash bonuses. So jobs like that, they're the ones who tend to get the biggest bonuses.",are there times you get extra money?,is there a signing bonus?,did you get a signing bonus?,do recruiters bribe you to enlist?,,,,,,
"Military, Benefits",Navy,Can you tell me about military retirement?,"The Navy has some of the best retirement packages in the United States, that's hands down. After you've been in for twenty years, then you're allowed to have retirement. At the end of your twenty years, you can either on say I would like to retire, or you can stay in up to thirty years. So every year that you're in you get to have two and a half percent longer than twenty years. At twenty years you get half of your basic pay, so this is what I mean. The Navy gives you lots of money while you're in based on certain things. Sixty percent of what you make is your basic pay, then you get a little more for sustenance, which is just the basic things that you need for your home. You also get a little bit more for if you're on a submarine or not. Also you get some more basic allowance for housing for your housing costs. But sixty percent of that is your basic pay. So the navy gives you half that at a twenty year point. I'm a chief, I make $4,500 per month so they give me half of that at twenty years. If I chose to stay in longer then the add on another two and a half percent, two and a half percent, two and a half percent. Depending on what I retire as, it can be up to thirty years, so at thirty years that'll be seventy five percent of your basic pay. Now because I'm a chief I make $4,500 per month, but they basically take your highest three months of earning, and that's the cost that that they provide you for your retirement.",how do you plan for getting out of the military?,what do you do when you retire from the Navy?,what benefits do retirees get?,what is Navy retirement?,,,,,,
"Military, Opportunities, Resources",,Describe the hiring process.,"Whenever you want to join the military, then you have to go to one of the different service branches. So there's one in every major city, sometimes there are two. So you go into whichever one you feel you might most be fitted for. I actually tried to join the airforce at first, but I ended up in the Navy. There's gonna be somebody behind a desk that's going to you know say can you please have a seat, so why do you want to join? What kinds of things interest you? They'll ask lots of questions about like how did in high school, what your interests are, and see if you're a good fit. They're also trying to see if you have a kind of criminal background and if you seem maybe uncommitted, they'll probably push you to the side. But they want to give everybody a chance so after you have your initial conversation with him, he'll ask you to take a practice test. It could be right there at that same time. So the recruiter will guide you to another room and the test is kind of like a little mini scholostic achievement test, a mini SAT. It has a little bit of physics there, math there, a little bit of english there, just general things. So you don't have to be scared of the test, it's not a pass or fail. It's more like what types of jobs you can have. So you take the test and where you score he'll say he has a list of maybe sixty, seventy jobs these are the ones that you qualify for. If you don't qualify for the job you want, then you're allowed to practice a little bit more. He'll give you some resources that you can use to study. But by that time if you are decided on the type of job that you want, that you're willing to do, then he will take you to, he or she will take you to this thing called MEPS, it's military entrance processing place that you can go to with lots of other people who are interested in joining the military to take the real test. The real test is nice and quiet, it's a lot longer, it's very comprehensive, and that's when they can offer you the real job. They'll probably serve you some breakfast in the morning it's an all day thing, and assuming that you pass the test on that same day, they can also have, get you through medical at that time which means that they'll check your eyes, check your dental, make sure that you're physically fit to go through it, and maybe the entire recruiting process could take maybe a week, maybe even a couple of days I have heard. But for me it took several months. They have you in this thing called delayed entrance processing where you do your test, you figure out the job that you want and maybe you don't have to join the service until a good time for them, which could be like a year later or maybe after your high school, after you graduate high school or after you finish your job or something like that.",what is it like getting into this line of work?,how do I get a job in the Navy?,what is recruitment?,how do I get hired?,,,,,,
"Training, Military",Navy,Describe the initial training.,"After you get done with your initial entrance processing for the military, then you're onward to boot camp. Boot camp is about three months, and they train you on simple things, tying knots, communicating with other people, how to do drill formations, things that you see in Full Metal Jacket. If you want to watch the first half of that movie then you understand what boot camp tries to be like. After that, then you're onward to your first vocational school, which is called A school. It ranges in size my school was six months, but it could be as short as two weeks. In general it's a couple months. After that time, then you're supposed to go off to your ship unless your in an advanced program like I was, in which case you'll go on to another school. My next school was a nuclear power school for another six months, and then after that I had prototype training, which means that they sent me to a real prototype to train on the real thing with people watching me, of course and that was six months. Then I went to my ship.",what was your initial career training like?,did someone show you the ropes?,were you sent to training when joining?,what are the first days at work like?,what is it like to join the Navy?,,,,,
"Training, Military",Navy,What is boot camp like?,"Boot camp is the initial training that all military members go through. So you go to this place near the Chicago area and they put you in a division, it's about maybe thirty people or so. It's very very strict there. Everybody's in bunk beds and be teach you how to make your bed, but it's in a very special way. All the creases have to be aligned perfectly, all of the sheets have to be super clean and facing the same way. So it's not, when they teach you to make this bed, it's not the fact that they want you to make a bed this way, it's the fact that they're looking to make sure that you can follow directions. They give you a list of steps and they make sure that number one you don't talk back to them, number two that you do it at the time that it is supposed to be done, at six o'clock or at five o'clock in the morning, with you standing outside of your bed with it already been made. They make sure that there's nothing on the bed or inside the bed, or that it's all made the same way. So there's a lot that goes into making this bed. So I'm mentioning this bed part because everything about boot camp is the exact same way, from the books that you train on, to the knots that you're making, to the way that you do your drills. It's not that they're trying to teach you these things, they are but they're actually filtering out who has no problem with following directions and who needs a little bit more time to train in these things, and for some reason like let's say you come from a bad neighborhood, you don't like being talked to and yelled at, those are people that would have problems if they go out into the real service. So they take those people to the side, maybe they're in boot camp for a little bit longer or maybe they actually get kicked out of boot camp. But by the time you get done with your three months or four months of boot camp, you should have a good idea of what discipline is like, and how to follow directions from the simplest of tasks to the more complex tasks.",did your military training go well?,tell me about recruit training?,did you have to learn to march?,what is boot camp?,is boot camp hard?,,,,,
"STEM, Opportunities",,What are the different types of careers in computer science?,"Computer science is a really broad field so whether you like to work with your hands or whether you like to work with your mind, there's something for everybody. So for the people that like to get into the machine, you can do hardware, computer hardware, and that's when you open it up and you look at the motherboard, you check the voltage of it if you're going to be like fixing it. Or gonna try to figure out like how to design everything in a nice ten inch by eight inch little square you know, like so that it all fits. So how to put the USB in a certain spot. If you want to deal with the way that the computer looks, that could be like web design. There's this thing called Cascading Style Sheets where they make regular text like ""my name is Clint"" and you can make it like big, blue, bright, colorful and you know make it dancing all along the screen. So it doesn't take that much computer science knowledge to do web design, that's what's it's a really popular field for people who are just getting into computer science. Now if you're mathematically inclined then you can start thinking about the way that the letters dance on the screen, or the way that Marla jumps, or the way Marla being a video game character, or the way that an operating system like does the process that it's doing behind the scenes. So like let's say there's a little bit of math that goes into it, nothing too complex we're not dealing with calculus here but we are dealing with very, it's hard to describe, and when you think of computer scientist being smart then your thinking about programmers. Those are the ones who I'm talking about. Programmers are the ones who open up an application and they start typing inside and they tell the computer, computer listen to me can you please open this application and make this jump, and make this, when I press the enter key make sure that the program closes and another program opens, and this is the first word that shows up on the screen when I do this. So programmer are, they actually program the computer to work. Another thing is graphics, where this is the way that the light reflects from the computer. So you kind of think about the way that TV screens have looked throughout the ages. First they came in black and white, then they had a little bit of color, and then they had a lot more pizzazz and they're very very sharp now. TVs now, they look like real life people as opposed to like the blurry ones from before. So the people in graphics, they're the ones who constantly make sure that the programmers do the right code so that the computer knows how to do it really fast, and so that the light that reflects doesn't make the computer slow and that it looks really clear to the viewer. So those are several of the many computer science jobs that are available ranging from the really hardware based to the graphics to the programming to graphics, there are many more.",what are the subspecialties in CS?,are there different ways to do a computer science career?,what are the different paths you can take in a computer science career?,what can I do in the computer science field?,,,,,,
"Advice, Resources, STEM",,Who do I talk to if I'm interested in this computer science?,"If you're thinking about becoming a computer scientist yourself, I would have to say that the first thing you should do is probably look online to find out about what different types of jobs there are and what it is they do. With a little bit of experience, with a little bit of browsing around on Google, you can kinda get an idea about it. But it they don't really tell you exactly what they do, so the next person would be probably someone in the field obviously. If you can find a NASA computer scientist then go for it you know, but any university student who's your junior, senior level, they have your basic programming skills they have your basic idea of what computer theory involves. So just asking a couple questions you know, whether it's been hard for them, whether anybody with a with a normal high school degree can kinda do this work, whether the job that they're doing is really really complex. It ranges so they might not be the guide you the best, but they can give you an idea of like kind of where you fit in, and whether it's a career that you want to try yourself.",what are good sources of information in CS?,are there people to whom I should talk about this career path?,who should I avoid talking to when considering this kind of work?,who can I get advice about CS from?,,,,,,
"Military, Culture",Navy,What is dress attire in the Navy?,"Our uniform ranges a lot from clothes that you wear everyday like this, these are camouflage, this is a camouflage shirt that I'm wearing and matching pants and really hard, rock hard boots to make sure that you don't stub your toe. And you can go on up to your dress blues which is like when you're going to a very special occasion, maybe some kind of ceremony, that you need to look very presentable, you wouldn't work in your dress blues. So other uniforms that we wear, I wear khakis. Chiefs which is E7, E8, E9 and officers they've wear things call khakis, which is like a nice pressed uniform, it's brown with white instead of this blue, and matching pants. You can work in them but generally those are people that kind of oversee people working. The workers on the other hand they can wear these things called coveralls, which is it brings you back to your five year old days, which is like a one piece body suit. You can put one leg in, one leg in, put your arms in, then zip it all the way up and coveralls look like the things that people that change oil, their clothes, they wear. So if you think about someone changing your oil, he gets on that like sliding machine thing, then goes up under the car.

"Military, Culture",Navy,To what extent does the military adhere to tight schedules both long term and daily?,"Since you're going to be in the military, you have to make sure that you're on time for things. So if you show up late, then people will look at you ""Hey you know come on time next time."" You show up late twice then you get scolded, come late three times then chances are you could be sitting in front of a chief having him and other chiefs like come down on you, and you do it four times then you probably get written up with the counseling check, which means that like I said ""Hey like I told this guy it's a cause for being fired from the military so make sure that you don't do it again."" So yeah if that's not  your deal you know, you show up whenever you want, then you should erase that from your vocabulary because the Navy's pretty tight with their schedules.",are you time constrained in what you do every day or across your entire career?,is there any slack built into your work day?,how important is time management in the Navy?,Is it okay to be late?,,,,,,
"Opportunities, Fit, Military",Navy,How can I request to work in a certain area or field?,"The field that you want to work in is specifically guided by how well you did on the test. So basically you rate. So it's very important to kind of, if you do want to work in a demanding field, to try to score as high as you can. If you don't get the job you want when you tried first tried, then before you join try to you know bump it up a little bit you know, to try to get that job. So once you're in the military, then there's gonna be a big range of jobs that you can do. You can work in the library, you can work you know with electrical components, at least for me as an Electrician's Mate I had a wide range of things that I could do. So if you're trying to ask which job I can do, which job can I apply for, a lot of it's kind of political. A lot of it's well you know like we've known him for a while, he's been on the ship for a long time so like he has a choice. Since you just come to the ship then like this is the only job that we have for you you know. You could be painting this deck or scrubbing this floor, right that's the job that we have for you. But if you've been in for a lot longer then you have a little bit of leeway in asking for jobs, and again you know within your rate, it depends on how high you score. So for instance there's going to be people who will be providing work to other people who are going to be writing it down, writing their job descriptions down and providing it. We need those people to be some of the brightest so if you don't have a good work history, then you might not be able to apply for for that job. So number one try to score as high as possible, and number two try to learn on the job as much as possible, and that's how you can get the best job that you want.",how likely is it that I will get to do what I want to do?,will the Navy assigned me to something I hate to do?,can I do another job if I don't like mine?,are jobs in the Navy permanent?,,,,,,
"Military, Training, Challenges",Navy,What was the most difficult part of your training?,"The most difficult part of training I gotta say, it's probably the material, at least for nuclear technology. I wasn't a very good student. I got good grades but it was really difficult for me to learn the material myself. Like for instance one of the things that we learned is what grounds are you know, and it took me so long to figure out what a ground is, like ground they say it's the earth you know. Like what do you mean by that? Eventually you find out that ground means that that's a plane of neutral electricity so that you can have high voltage and low voltage and ground means, and there is a way to learn it but it just took me a really long time to learn it because I wasn't really technical. So that's a really simple thing I learned that you know like I had to catch up on, but they're a lot more complex things you know, like when you learned about multiplexes, you're learning about the way that the voltage regulator really works on the inside you know. Those can be really difficult so it's a wrap your head around, but eventually with enough opening the pages and putting your eyes on it over and over and over, it become simple.

"STEM, Challenges",,What is the most difficult part of computer science?,"The most difficult part about learning what computer science is and getting into it is getting past the first block that you have, that I had thinking that it's difficult, thinking that computer science is something for other people. Think about, thinking that it's for smart people, for math people, or for people that got 4.0's in school you know. It's not you know, you have a wide range just like any other job out there, so once you get past that then you have to realize the book that you're reading maybe is written by computer scientists themselves you know. So there could be a time when you have to close the book and go you know prep yourself a little bit more you know, find some material online, find some easy to understand topics that can kind of prep you to go back to the more difficult book that you're reading in your hands. So yeah the material can be hard sometimes, the projects that we have can be you know really demanding, but with enough time you know, they say seven years you become an expert.

There looking at each other and making jokes you know doing you know a lot of like childish things all the time.

"Money, Military",,How does an officer's/non-officer's salary compare to civilian salaries?,"The salaries that the military people make, they kind of range in how they compare to what civilians make. So officers kind of make slightly less than their civilian counterparts. That is, an officer you can take any officer and put them in a civilian job and they'd probably be making about ten to twenty thousand dollars more in the civilian sector. However, there's a lot of job security that comes with being in the military. You're not going to get fired unless you like really messed up. Now that you're protecting our country and you're doing it in an efficient manner you know, you're doing it effectively. So there's a cost with that and the cost is our salary, so there is a saying that the military don't make that much, and it can be true in some cases. However if you do it with pride and you enjoy you work and you think about the excellent retirement benefits that they give you, you'll see that maybe by the end of your twenty years you know, you didn't make that much less, however you have a much more fulfilling career. For enlisted people, it could very very similar or even better than your civic counterparts, at least for nuclear technicians we made a lot less than our civilian counterparts.  In fact many people get out after six or eight years and then they start working and they could easily make double what they're making. That is they leave as a first class petty officer making about sixty five or seventy thousand dollars a year and then they can make double that working as Homer Simpson you know down at the nuclear power plant. Other things like maybe a cook or Boatsmen's Mate or let's say a weapons handler, they can find very very similar jobs out there so then they have the choice. Do I stay in the military that I've already put in like maybe six or seven years, or I do I become a civilian, maybe have to start all over, but start at a higher rate and higher job position than I would have if I would just join from high school. So many people in that position they probably stay in military because the retirements, and the amount of time they put in as far as their pride you know.

"Military, JobSpecific, Travel",Navy,How significant is there a chance of being deployed?,"Everyone in the military that is on a ship will be deployed at sometime. So our schedule is we do one and a half years on the shore, and then we do six months at sea. We do that twice and after that time, after that four year period, then you're scheduled to go work on a short command, and that should be anywhere from two to three years. So it depends on whether we're at war or not, whether the up tempo is really high or not, whether the ship that you're on has been out to sea a lot, but that's generally, the two year, the two year ship shore schedule is generally what it is.",how often do you go to sea?,will I get deployed?,how much will I be away from my family?,does everyone get deployed?,do I have to leave home if I am in the military?,,,,,
"Lifestyle, Military, Benefits",Navy,What things are there for me to do on a ship?,"When you're on your ship you have a lot of opportunities available to you. Now I won't lie, the bigger the ship you're on the more opportunities that are available. So you have a really small ship let's say a destroyer, that's not small but like the destroyer is I guess a ship that has maybe a couple thousand people on it. It's kind of like a high school you could say, the size of a high school. And there aren't that many things to do. I've never been on a destroyer but I just know from my experience with the aircraft carrier. It has to have less than what I had and at least for an aircraft carrier which has five thousand people usually. When we're on deployment we have, it goes up to eight thousand people when you add all the people that come in with airplanes, and the people that take care of the airplanes, and the extra officers and enlisted people. Eight thousand people is the size of a small city. So on an aircraft carrier we have our own post office, we have our own little recreation center. We have a couple of places for fitness, but in general it is a war craft vessel. Therefore there aren't that many, there are limited places that you can do, that you can have on the ship that cater to entertainment. So people find their own entertainment. So for me, my entertainment on the ship was I'd watch movies all the time. So everybody has their own little laptop or their DVD player, you can rent movies from the little recreation center that's there. They had bands in little hidden spots of the ship. So there would be drums and guitars and you know like even keyboards all hidden, but that did they make space and you know they play as loud as they want. Obviously the fitness centers are there, and you can see card playing all over the place. Whenever there is a rack, a living quarter, then there's this little table outside you know like three or four of them. With couches to watch TV to watch movies and to play cards right there, so that's how we spent our deployments.","if I am at sea, what can I do to relax?",is there free time to do stuff on a ship?,what kinds of break activity is there at sea?,Is a ship boring?,,,,,,
"Advice, Decisions, Military",Navy,Why should someone choose to be a part of the Navy?,"I chose to be a part of the navy yes because I wanted to further my career and have you know a good salary, all the benefits, but I also feel that you have to serve your country at sometime in your life. Now I know that sounds cliche, but that's the way that I feel. I came from a really military family. My uncle was in the military, my dad was in the military, my brother was in the military, and me too, and although yes I could of just been a civilian, like I was on that path. It felt like, at least for me in particular, it felt like something would've been missing from my life, something I can't be on my death bed and say that I never protected my country the way that I saw my family protect it. So it was a calling for me. Why would other people join the military especially if you don't have military people in your family, you have to think. Well first you have to trust your politicians. You'd have to think that they're going to war and they're defending America for good reason. So the wars that we fight we hope will bring stability to the world. You might see on TV that you know children are bloodied and people are you know like running for their lives, running from terrorism, running from lots of different things, you know you've seen the news. So if you wanna be a part of bringing that to an end, then military is one way that you can at least try. Also defending the nation, now we've been safe for a long time. Yes we had 9-11 and yes there are domestic terrorists but compared to other countries in the world, you might realize that America is a pretty safe place to live. When you're considering foreign powers trying to come in and influence us. So we have that strong military to thank for that.

So when I was in the military I did a job and I noticed that whatever I did on January 1st wouldn't really be recognized on December 31st, it's because I'm doing the same job. That's fine for a lot of people, but for me I chose to try something different than the military job that I was doing because I wanted my job to be persistent. So this is what I mean. Right now I'm with the University of Southern California's Institute for Creative Technology making this video. This video could be seen by thousands, hundreds of thousands, hopefully millions of other Navy people. I could affect those lives. These are things that are going to be happening you know five years from now, ten years from now. So I can actually affect my world. Many engineering communities are like that. If you're making a robot right, if you make that robot on January 1st, hopefully December 31st you're shipping that robot, and that robot will go to Afghanistan and find a bomb you know. If you're an electrical technician, maybe you're making some kind of new component for a car and later on that car is gonna be faster because of the component you made. So for a lot of engineering jobs you work and then you create a component, you create a product, and then you can see that product in action, and that's one of the biggest benefits of being in a STEM field.","how will I make a difference?

But it turns out that when these are your friends you know, these are the guys that you're joking around with, these are the guys that you've been on deployment with and you have to see them everyday.

"Demographics, Military",Navy,What is the gender mix of your workplace?,"The gender mix is very male oriented, just like any engineering job. any engineering academic field, they sway over to to men. So the Navy's pretty good about that, the Air Force is the best I think, they're you know getting close to like sixty forty percent maybe even higher, male to female ratio. I think the Navy is a little bit lower it's from what I understand, maybe my aircraft carrier was one quarter female, at least that's kind of what I saw, and that's about what it was. But it could be lower, maybe twenty percent is probably what I'm guessing. The engineering field of the Navy is, on submarines depends you know which ones you're going on. If it's a fast attack submarine I think they just barely started just a couple years ago started allowing females on, and if you're on a ballistic submarine, which means they shoot nukes off, nuclear weapons off, then they don't have females on there at all.",how many guys and how many ladies at work?,is there a decent mix of men and women in the service?,are there many of both sexes where you have been assigned?,are any girls in the Navy?,,,,,,
"Demographics, Military",Navy,What are the ethnic percentages of your workplace?,"The Navy is pretty diverse. I think it also depends on which location you're in, because people tend to go back to where they come from. So let's say South Carolina which is very white then it probably has a higher percentage of white people there. In California, which is very very diverse, then you have a lot more of a diverse mix there you know so, but despite that wherever there's a military town, it's much more diverse than the outlying area by far so you don't really have to worry about being in a select group in the military, it's it's all over the place. So I think from what I saw, there's, percentages would probably go maybe five percent Filipino, maybe ten percent black, maybe fifty percent white, twenty percent Asian, and then the rest is a kind of mix. But like I said it really depends on what your rate is. For maybe the higher level rates, it tends to be mostly white and Asian, and it also depends on which city you live in, for there's people that want to come back to live around their family.",are people at work from all races?,is there any segregation by race?,what is the breakdown of race and national origin in the workplace?,Is your work racially diverse?,,,,,,
"Decisions, Military","Negative, Navy",Why do people leave this field or company?,"There are a lot of reasons that people leave the military. The military has a lot of great reasons to stay, the retirement benefits, the job security, serve the country. However, I think especially when people want to make a higher salary, and they find a good job outside and they want to just try to do something else, then that can be a good motivating factor. The military can be very dangerous, especially like for the people that send the planes off. If you do that you know every single year, month after month, day after day, then that could affect your hearing. You can be in many dangerous situations and some people just don't want to do that type of job anymore, that can be risky. Another reason that people leave the military is because they want to see their family grow. When you're on deployment that's a good six months that you don't see your daughter grow. You don't see your son grow, you're not with your wife, you're not with your husband. So after a few of those deployments, you kinda start to miss that, you actually want to see when your spouse has their kid you know. If your wife is pregnant you want to actually see it be born. And I know a lot of people who weren't there for that, so that's the third reason that I see a lot of people leave the military.",what makes people want to quit?,is there a reason that drives personnel to leave the service?,why do so many people leave the military?,what reasons are there to leave the Navy?,,,,,,

I think to be one of the, to make a high salary in computer science you have to be really good at it, that's hands down. If you're just kinda average then you'll make an average salary so, but having a really good job is on the top of every computer scientist's mind, but not everybody is so great at it. So me I'm in Japan, I'm studying a lot I open books and watch online tutorials to try to get to that point. If I don't get to that point, then maybe I would try to do something similar to computer science, but maybe not specifically on, there's web designing, there's Electrician's Mate, there are lots of jobs that like, for instance a director. Those could be jobs. So I think if other people, if other computer scientists are like me, then I guess they might become discouraged because the job that they're trying to do is difficult, and it's hard to learn those difficult things.",do people get tired of science?,is technology a field that keep people for a long time?,do people leave the STEM field?,what if I get bored with STEM?,,,,,,
"Lifestyle, Military, Advice",Navy,"How will my relationship with my friends or family members be affected if I join the Navy, and what advice should i give them?","I think that there will be two major things that anybody who knows you would kind of think about you after you join the military. Number one is they'll give you a lot of respect. They know what the military does you know, everybody knows like how the military you know fights these wars and if they're Americans then they probably have, they give a lot of credit for risking your life for them. Number two they will probably be scared. They'd be scared for your life, especially if you're going to go fight a war, and they'd be scared for your safety, because the military has a lot of dangerous places outside of war. So respect for you and fear for you. If you can kind of manage those two, then you can kind of convince them hey you know like the military could be the right choice, and as much as you want my safety, you have to realize like the job I'm trying to do is for everybody's benefit.",can my being in the Navy worry my family and friends?,how do I tell my family or parents that I am joining the military?,what should I tell my folks about the Navy?,will my relationships suffer from being in the Navy?,,,,,,
"Education, Benefits, Military",Navy,How do the educational benefits of the military work?,"Once you join the military then you're a part of a group that really wants you to succeed, especially educationally. So we have this thing called tuition assistance, it provides you $2,500 per month, actually $2,500 in one year to take any community college class that you want. We also have the Montgomery GI Bill, which was changed to the 9-11 educational benefit for people who have served and who get out of the military and want to continue on their, continue their education. You can use it while in the military but it's kind of a waste because they don't give you as much as people who get out actually get. There's also Ihis thing called CLEP (College-Level Examination Program) it's basically they allow you to take some courses that provide community college course credit, that's specifically for the military, and many of those CLEP courses are free. So you can actually like work towards your college degree with those CLEP courses for like while you're on deployment, which is when you're out fighting a war for six months, or when you're back home on shore during your off time. You can also like do some kind of online community college courses or you can take university courses. They provide lots of veterans benefits, maybe free benefits that you can take the class or a reduced price.",describe my chances of getting education in the Navy.,does the military pay for your college?,how can I pay for school and join the military?,how do I receive the military educational benefits?,,,,,,
"Growth/learning, Future",,What is the advancement potential in the field? What is a typical path?,"The advancement potential that you have when you're in the military really depends on the job that you have. So I'm an Electrician's Mate, nuclear trained. So at the end of six or eight years, many people actually leave the service, so because that happens there's a wide open range for people that want to keep progressing, because like the top is open, so that means that you know they train and then once they get to that point, because nobody  is ahead of them, then they get the rate. There's also lots of Electrician's Mates available, like jobs available. So if you're in a job that has only a few spots available, like let's say it's a very specific job for a specific ship, or a job that's really really nice, really comfortable and no one wants to leave, then that means that those higher positions are staying there, they don't retire after eight years or ten years, they stay until twenty. That means that that's gonna block. So it would be helpful for you to figure out which job you're getting and try to ask about the advancement potential early on so that you know that you're in a job that can promote easily and fast.",how do you get promoted?,can I impact how soon I get advanced?,how does advancement work?,is it common to be promoted?,,,,,,
"Skills, Future, Military",Navy,How will my experience transfer to civilian life after my Navy tour of duty?,"When you're transferring to civilian life, it really depends on what type of job you had when you were in the military service. So I was an Electrician's Mate, which means that the word electrician is a part of lots of jobs out there, so it shouldn't be too difficult to find a job that kind of fits my job on the ship. I was also a nuclear technician and obviously there are much fewer jobs out there for that, but they can be found. So every job in the military has a basic breakdown of all the things that they performed in very general categories. So some are more transferable than others. If you worked on nuclear weapons then chances are there aren't that many jobs for you. Comparatively there aren't that many jobs out there. However, if you're a cook let's say, then you know every city, every town, every shop, every place that that has shops for cooks has a job that you can apply for. So it really depends on the type of job that you get.",is this training useful in civilian life?,will this help me get a good job when I get out?,do employers like to hire veterans?,will my Navy skills transfer to civilian life?,,,,,,
"Military, Culture",Navy,What is a story that really shows what it is like being in the Navy?,"A story that really shows what it's like to be in the military, I have to say will be Oliver Stone's Full Metal Jacket. If you haven't watched it, go ahead and watch it because then you'll understand what boot camp is like, and the time that he had after the boot camp scene was during a war and it depends on when you're watching this whether you are in a war or not, but I think everything from the way that they talk to each other to the uniforms that they wear, to the jokes that they make, it's very very similar to how military people act. So you should watch that movie and then you'll have a much better idea about what the Navy is like.","tell me a good ""sea story"" that reveals the real Navy.",is there some tale that would help me understand the Navy life?,are there experiences you have had that exemplify a Navy career?,,,,,,,
"Military, Benefits",Navy,What do Navy reservists do and what benefits do they get?,"I'm in the military reserves, and it is exactly what the name says. It's a reserve, so we don't actively fight the wars. What we do is we, number one make sure that we are prepared to fight, and number two we train a lot to make sure that our mind is ready to fight. For me I was in the military for eight years, and then I got out joined the reserves. What that means is that the reserves call me at any time and they'll have somebody with eight years of active duty experience being able to fight. That means I know what a ship is, I know how to read the label plates to find out what I'm looking for, I know how to fix these pumps, and I know how to drive the ship, I know the valves to close when you're trying to shut off steam. So these are things that they don't have to teach me, as opposed to a civilian who has no experience, no training, and maybe that doesn't have the discipline to come and fight the war right away. So if we're going to fight a war, first people that go over are the active duty people. If you need more people then they call on me, the reservist people, a reserve person who stops his normal civilian job and becomes an active duty member for the amount of time that the Navy tells me to be. It could be anywhere from a few months to several years. After that time, then I'm supposed to come back to my civilian job, hopefully the civilian job is still there for me when I get back.

"Growth/learning, Skills, Military",Navy,What experience is necessary to become an officer?,"To become an officer you need two basic things. Number one you need a college degree time, that's a requirement. Number two you need to be able to present a good managerial style, people need to think that you can lead. Just because you have a degree doesn't mean that you have the authority or, doesn't mean that you have the presence of command to get people to follow you. So once you're going through the officer training program they either teach that to you or they don't allow you to join the military service. They would basically kick you out, so you need a college degree and you need to be able to supervise other people.",how can I become an officer?,what do you have to do to be eligible to become an officer?,do you have to have a college degree to get a commision?,do officers have special training?,,,,,,
"Management, Advice",,How do you get good feedback?,"With any job it's incredibly important to have a good source of feedback for the jobs that you do. If you're in a position where like you supervisor doesn't give you the the feedback that you need, he doesn't show you the right way to do things. What the Navy is really good for is having multiple resources to go to. So of course if you have one chief above you and you're an enlisted person and he's not listening to you, then what they say is that you can go above him. It's not generally expected that you do that, but it is possible you know. Everybody from the captain of the ship all the way down for the most part has an open door policy, which means that if something is on your mind you can come talk to them. Generally they like you to follow the hierarchy. So the first question that they are going to ask is ""did you ask the person underneath me?"" so beside you, if you have a problem with someone above you, you talk to the people to your left or right. Then you talk to the people, let's say it's a chief that you're complaining about, then you talk to another chief. And then, if neither of those listen, then maybe the senior chief or maybe the officer of the unit and onwards up. So if you have a problem your feedback, then there are lots of resources that you can go to.",can you tell me what to do if I get a chief or officer who is not helping me?,how will I know if I am doing a good job?,will others help me evaluate what I am doing right and what I need help with?,how can I make sure to get good feedback?,How do you handle supervisors who were unable or unwilling to give you feedback?,,,,,
"Decisions, Military",Navy,What are the most important decisions that you faced as a leader in your organization?,"Some of the most important decisions that I've faced have to do with morality I would say. So here's what I mean. The most important thing that you can do in the military is follow directions, but not everybody does that, unfortunately, and your tasks as a supervisor is to confront these things and take care of them appropriately. So this is what I mean. Let's say that there is somebody on the ship, coming onto the ship any he's drunk and he's not supposed to be drunk. What do you do? So you could either grab him by the collar and take him to the local Master at Arms this person in trouble right, and that's the right thing to do. Another right thing to do would be to chastise him, to handle it in house to make sure that he doesn't do it again to kind of supervise and mentor him, if you think that he's that type of person so you don't have to necessarily ruin his career. So basically it's a morality question, the type of personality that you have and how willing to stick to the books you are to make sure that you do the right thing. When it comes to things that are going on in the plants, things that are going on in the engineering field there's no morality involved. If that thing is leaking you don't think hey you know like should I fix it or not, it's not that big. No if it's leaking, if X then Y. But when you're dealing with people, people with personalities, people with emotions, people with families, you have to really take all of that into consideration and to determine the wise thing to do, not necessarily the thing that's written in the book.",tell me about tough choices you have had to make.,what kinds of command decisions have fallen into your lap?,"do you have to make critical decisions and, if so, what kinds?",what major decisions have you faced in the military?,,,,,,
"Advice, Background",,Who gave you the best advice about your life?,"The person who probably gave me the best advice about my life I have to say, it would be my friends, especially my Navy friends. I have a good friend he was a fellow nuclear electrician with me, we've been learning computer science together, we fought through our electrician trainings together, and he went off and did his own thing and just a conversation that we had you know like sitting around with some coffee or some beers, we talked about like well what do you want to be? Well I wanna be this. What do you want to be? For instance he actually taught me a lot about mortgages and stuff. I read this book that he presented its called Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki, and after reading that book then I kinda got ideas like okay rather than the cubicle thing I probably want to make my own business or something. I'd rather you know like have some kind of other income rather than a nine to five job. Or rather we would talk about his prior relationship and the fact that like his wife maybe didn't want to work so much. And we thought about like the income and outcome of his of a one working party system. You know like if one person doesn't work and the other person just takes care of the kids, then I guess you can't be as rich as you normally would be. So that had an effect on me, the person that I wanna meet in the future. Do I want like a housewife, which is fine you know. She could have a decent life making kids and you know making dinner and you know folding clothes. Or do I want a someone who's working, in which case like my clothes would suffer, my kids who suffer, my household chores would suffer you know. So like things like that are very very important to consider and to consider wisely and the fireside chats with my friend actually got me to think about my life, my future life very very very hard.",Who is your life mentor?,what person do you rely on for life advice?,what is the best piece of life advice you've gotten?,,,,,,,

That's what I'm doing myself. Hopefully I'll eventually reach that goal or at least you know fight the good fight or smiling until my death bed trying to follow my passion. I guess if I were following my passion then I would probably be in a nice paying job with a nice car and a nice house down the street in a nice cul de sac. But for some reason I feel like what I wanna do is, I want to own my own business one day, or I want to make some really outstanding computer science product. So because I'm doing that, it feels like my life is worth doing. Rather than me working for someone else, helping someone else make their dream come true, making the best Pepsi can in the world, or making the best table in the world, or making power for people of Orange County you know.
