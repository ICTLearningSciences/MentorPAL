What's up?,I'm enjoying life here in Japan %HESITATION I just got through teaching of the class earlier today and it was really fun so 
How is the weather?,the weather is actually pretty cold it's very sunny here in classical Japan and you think that you can go outside and you think up but it's freezing 
How are you?,I would say that I'm pretty good today I %HESITATION but the study not really so my mind and my motivation is pretty high and I I'm smiling every single day so life is good 
Where are you?,right now I am in the north east of Japan it's in the total could resume I you might remember that that's the place that the big earthquake of Japan happened in two thousand eleven so I'm in kind of like the countryside of Japan and %HESITATION they're big buildings and skyscrapers but %HESITATION life is very %HESITATION quite open this 
What are your hobbies?,my hobbies are very %HESITATION very different depending on which country I'm in so right now I'm in Japan ands I %HESITATION I don't really do too much of it and play video games but when I'm in the United States and I'm playing online games guild wars two and I do lots of Hartford %HESITATION issue our tree with the USC archery club and I do it here to the college you go you know which is like very well of a super cool way of doing archery but it's %HESITATION I like doing that sports 
How did you get into archery?,I got into our tree based on of the fact that I was kind of the geek when I was growing up I used to play dungeons and dragons and %HESITATION you know that %HESITATION they're like these warriors and elves and my favorite character was like arranges so we always had as little of help your friend you know like kind of pet and it always goes to things %HESITATION so %HESITATION I grew up in Alabama and we use to shoot guns a lot too and the fact that I was into that kind of %HESITATION game in the fact that I use that you guys myself really got me into like a like long distance kind of a kind of sports so %HESITATION I got my two %HESITATION a experts of my marks minimize start shooter %HESITATION publications and %HESITATION because I'm really good with my eyes you know that got me into it archery because it's like he's a to do here rather than shooting guns 
What is a chief?,%HESITATION where this anger right here the chief is basically the supervisor of the enlisted side of the operational problem portion of the ship %HESITATION he's actually been in the navy for a long time most chiefs become chiefs after about twelve years or maybe fourteen years %HESITATION some of the hot runners can %HESITATION become chief after eight years but basically no matter what number one they're really good at their job our number two they have the support of the officers to make sure that they can take of the plants themselves and number three they %HESITATION they have really get expertise and %HESITATION years in doing what they've been doing so they can be trusted terror actually tell you what to do because they've done it so many times 
"What does ""in port"" mean?",so we have this term it's import import means that you're stationed your your station you're actually add another country's %HESITATION kind of naval base %HESITATION you might not actually enable base it's a place that whole ship so we on the planet islets are you in the middle of the %HESITATION on of the ocean you there for a month or two months %HESITATION then you finally wanna you know put your feet on the land so %HESITATION you could priced up in Hong Kong or Singapore where they can hold a ship that's safe for a United States naval vessel %HESITATION you can pull it and then that's a new country for you that's import 
"Where have you been ""in port""?",I was fortunate enough to be in court at many places so I've been to Singapore Malaysia Hong Kong Japan I've also been to a Australia out three times to Perth in Hobart I've been to %HESITATION what sort of a into so many places about ten paces off 
"Where have you been ""in port""?",I was fortunate enough to be in court %HESITATION in many countries I got to go to Hong Kong Singapore I want to Australia three different places the Hong Kong in Tasmania I also like to do by hand but rain in Kuwait I got to go to the the Malaysia Malaysia the Golden Triangle which is really cool %HESITATION my favorite place was sizeable Japan which is %HESITATION where I am now yeah and a couple of other places is really been fun during 
What is A school?,a school is the initial training that join the members of the list them with a branch go to so my school was collections made a school %HESITATION whatever your rate is then you have a school and %HESITATION for initial people see school for a more advanced people so a schools can range from %HESITATION maybe a couple of weeks %HESITATION maybe several years mine was a about six months 
What is a rate?,a rate is basically a specialty that a military prison has so my rate is EMC electors in Spain on but you could have fire control man could have books was made so whatever you are go to a school for %HESITATION that's gonna be the term your rate for the rest of your military for 
What experience do you have with nuclear bombs?,so the nuclear question what experience do I have with nuclear bombs I don't have any %HESITATION any idea what they are I'd know kind of like those inside them because my job security deals with nuclear things %HESITATION but %HESITATION the new clear technology that's used to power and aircraft to go through the water is very different from the nuclear armed reaction that goes on inside a nuclear bomb now that's not to say that %HESITATION some people don't I was on an aircraft carrier which means that %HESITATION they're known nukes on an aircraft carrier however other tech %HESITATION nuclear technicians they go on submarines now we have %HESITATION so ballistic submarines so they're walking right beside those nuclear bombs falling trident's or yeah yeah I don't know anything about the submarine force have to ask 
What is deployment?,the point is the term that we use for when a ship goes away from their home station in America are worth in the form for somewhere and they go off someplace far and %HESITATION far away to fight a war to be closer to of the war that's happening so for instance %HESITATION my ship was in Washington the men in the state of Washington so we deployed he went away %HESITATION which meant that we had to pack up our clothes we had to you know put lots of food on the ship that's really say goodbye to our family and we went off %HESITATION Florida about a month to go over there and then we just swim around in the ocean %HESITATION we let you know planes coop of our out of the carrier to drop bombs and it's not like we're gonna come back anytime soon so we're there for maybe six months sometimes eight months sometimes nine months and then we returned home so that entire tour from the time that you pack up and move out there in the coming back that's called the plane 
How often have you been deployed?,I've been deployed three times I joined the navy when I was twenty one years old Alan into thousands and then I stayed there for eight years so the first two years were for school amendment the last six years %HESITATION that's the time I was on the aircraft here and during that time I went out to see deployment floor for six months each was six months been seven months in eight months I would into your sprints so in two years is possible on a one to point it six month time this was to come back for a year I'm sorry it's just come back for your house so six month deployment one and a half years you know I'm stationed at home six month deployment when you have your station so because in for six years I did three different 
What was 9-11 like for you?,nine eleven has a special place in my heart because I had just joined the navy I will I was in school %HESITATION when it happens %HESITATION does maybe first year that I was in I had seen a ship yet I didn't know what the military life outside of school was like on but I remember walking down the steps to %HESITATION so my roommate when he saw a woman both saw together the first Hoffman's actually I saw the second plane hit the first one had already been hit and how my roommate called in it's like Hey look at this so %HESITATION after it got started I remember that there was a little bit of fear that I had you know I do know how big this thing's going to be %HESITATION I deftly did know that there was a war that was about to be started but I did realize that that's when it finally hit me before I thought the military is a place that you go you learn some kind of job you have a nine to five job and %HESITATION fighting some things you work out a little bit but after nine eleven happened then I realized you know what I got on there this job that used to be done and I'm proud to be the one that's been in to do this about %HESITATION islands protect protection mode at that time that's what it meant to me nine eleven 
Why do you love your job?,so I'm particularly fond of the military I I joined when I was %HESITATION twenty one and so I didn't really have that many skills available to me I I graduated high school and it wasn't the best high school grad you know many people in the military are and %HESITATION the tri college for awhile and is very %HESITATION on and off again student %HESITATION I got a few laughs when I was there and because I was working two jobs at the time and you know my my my days pitiful so the military actually allowed me to how a semi regular life you know I come right in because taking care myself because I did have the support of my family on the military a welcome me with a job please stay us some cash in my pocket %HESITATION some a skill set and that pretty much of once once I got that grounding in I was able to be very independent very a self sustaining for a long time so it's kind of it's it's a pyramid that way %HESITATION so do I love the military %HESITATION you could say that I do know it's it's that thing that you know allow me to have a college education later on the thing that allowed me to save so much money in the home I think I'm doing pretty well for someone my age so as far as my job my job as electricians may I didn't it's not the job that I really wanted to do at the beginning I want to learn languages and %HESITATION you know travel the world live and on a nuclear technician who are really allowed to do that because you knew you have to stay on the continental United States so I can visit I can be stationed in Germany I can be stationed in France %HESITATION which you know really it was irritating for me %HESITATION and I I wasn't a very good engineer I I didn't have engineering mindset when I joined the military at first %HESITATION however I grew to love my job because %HESITATION between that they give you the make a real expert at it so once you find a job to do you start doing well and then you start getting the words %HESITATION you start learning more things on your own and and if it's I said you know I'd like Christians legislators were really cool it's one of the best job you can have in the military %HESITATION so I think it's a my lovely maybe comes from all that combines 
What gets romanticized about your career field that really isn't that great?,so I'd have to admit the military does a very good job of marketing itself %HESITATION to be very %HESITATION very tough very strong and very team oriented hug you you can drive down any street and if you see a picture for the military you might see someone in in these %HESITATION in this uniform but in a very very movie style picture %HESITATION and it's not always like that up for the most part we not soldiers I I'm not a soldier I'm a sailor which %HESITATION is is different than what many people think of the military when you think when many people think the military they think of full metal jacket you know without your hard hat your your your helmet and you know walking around with a gun and tell you truth I've never you know picked up a a machine gun of the best I got was like a little laser pointer into town %HESITATION otherwise on I I've never I've never seen it done so the real military is a wide range of jobs %HESITATION you have people who are working on the weapon system yet people talking languages yeah people %HESITATION down in the nuclear plants yeah people better cooks %HESITATION get people showing the jets how to move but %HESITATION what's really presented what's romanticized is a the basic soldier you know the army style them for the marine style so and maybe some kind of different in a good way 
What makes the navy different than other branches of the military?,the navy is different than other branches in a lot of different ways but I think about the second or third year that I was in the military I would that I was in the navy %HESITATION I I start as for different types maybe five did you consider the Coast Guard so if you want to be the soldier that you hear about in the movies I've been joined the marines they work out a lot more than the first people that %HESITATION start to fight the war on you have to you know you'd be pretty strong and pretty brave arm in other matches too but more so for the for the marines %HESITATION if you want to be similar to the marines but you want %HESITATION you want a tough lifestyle you want the you know the rough rugged %HESITATION fighting but you're more mechanically oriented you can try the army so the army that's when you drive in tanks that's when you set up communication systems in the middle of the desert %HESITATION so so the kind of marines but they're not the first ones out there %HESITATION if you want %HESITATION kind of more civilians style job I've been joined airforce %HESITATION airforce is known that you it's known that you have some of the best equipment %HESITATION Frances at Travis airforce base that excellent golf clubs they have %HESITATION yeah basically nine to five job you can kind of sit in office many times it's not always that case you know you can find lots if it doesn't get any service but this was this is what was going on in my mind second year doesn't it in in so the navy is different from all of those so for instance when you're on the planet when you're six months when you're in travel around in the middle of the ocean for six months it's not like you're working out every day %HESITATION also it's not %HESITATION ninety five job in an office because you're working pretty much like the whole the whole day you know and it's not been an air conditioned office sometimes it down in the middle of the plants %HESITATION the thing that the navy has going for it is that you should be very technical %HESITATION should %HESITATION you should know your job better than any other civilian counterparts so if you want to be known as someone who's like a pretty bright with when it comes to computers when it comes to a problem mechanical components kicks in machines then the neighbors the neighbors 
What are some of the common misconceptions about your field?,some of them common misconceptions about being in the navy or the biggest one I hear is %HESITATION well how often do you swim and it's a villa I can't I can't even swim in exec let you know you're in you're in the navy yeah yeah I know it's not like %HESITATION here in the middle of the ocean and then you jump over the edge and you know like have a have a swim call anything you don't I I didn't really touch the water so let's so thank you John so many boats and you don't you know like touch the water at all up for being the navy that that's a trip for a lot of people 
What are some of the common misconceptions about working in nuclear technologies?,something that I get asked pretty often about my job being a nuclear technician is allowed to get through press the button and I always have to explain %HESITATION sunlit uses me as a nuclear technician I don't really work with nuclear bombs %HESITATION they get that confused I didn't know column in fact when I joined the military I thought I was gonna be working on nuclear bombs but %HESITATION the nuclear technology field is something different we were coming into so the nuclear technology that we're working with has nothing to do with exploding at all 
What do you do in the navy that is different from what you expected?,is very different than what I expected when I joined %HESITATION I didn't really know that much about the military my father was in the army and I should have had some of it including what I did but I I never you know I I barely visited when he was %HESITATION in the army he just came home and you know the careless so I had that same %HESITATION understanding that most people think about when they hear about them the military that is that gonna put on the hat going to wear these clothes and wouldn't you know go to foreign countries and fight wars so I did fight wars but I never really visited the country itself %HESITATION my war was on ship itself upon another an aircraft %HESITATION owned by American so I didn't ever go to Iraq I didn't ever go into Iran I didn't ever go to Saudi Arabia go to those places but I still popular so that's kind of different than what I was expecting I also %HESITATION bite into the mentality that everyday is gonna be like P. T. there's good training good for you there for me but I you barely work out %HESITATION you are suppose to keep in shape so if you get overweight and you know that could be a problem but %HESITATION for the navy at least yes as long as you're you meet the standards in their in their training which happens every six months %HESITATION they make sure that you're not overweight but you can do push ups and sit ups then you get to go and some people actually %HESITATION they kind of skate around the system so %HESITATION people are a lot less fit than what I thought I would be doing I thought I'd be like super buff you know models out but it's it's not really expected to be a 
How did your work day change over your career?,when I started my career then why wasn't he three which is the third rank that you can be in the hierarchy %HESITATION not a lot was expected of me %HESITATION I get to work they say go fix this pump go work with that guy and then at the end of the workday around like four five o'clock then %HESITATION I did not that much was really expected of me they'd be saying you don't just go to your bed or %HESITATION we'll we'll see you later on it depends on where the on the plane or whether you're stationed at home %HESITATION like you might have to work maybe one or two hours extra every other day however as %HESITATION I progressed when I became %HESITATION and he six which is a first class or a chief which is any seven then after that number work day of telling people what to do you know you're here there this seems at times that as they are on you have to do like the follow up at the end so for instance are they get done at the end of the day so now that we have that information while they get to go home where they get to like you know to have that downtime you have to go report that to other people yet to do the paperwork %HESITATION that other people are requiring so %HESITATION it's yet the wait till the normal work is done and then you have to add on supervisory %HESITATION tech %HESITATION specialists specialization that it did you at the very end so you work more as you get higher in the rank 
How has your view of this line of work changed over time?,chains for the military and a couple of ways the first way is that I understand the different roles of the military now before I I just thought we were just one big group you go fight a war and I didn't know who did what but now I I see where we stand globally %HESITATION %HESITATION as far as like what branches do what service aircraft people they stay pretty much on United States soil eminence in huge ships so do logistics %HESITATION marines they're the ones who keep in really good shape so that they can go ahead and get that first pushed we start the war always start a battle %HESITATION we have the the army people who likes to provide support to the marines and they find themselves to you know but they're the ones like you got to stop so like if you start to learn all these things and %HESITATION later on as a supervisor you get you get more information about why we are doing %HESITATION so for instance why we're fighting in Iraq why we are %HESITATION sending these planes over there and how the aircraft carrier can support them as opposed to like when you're you know press on this ship my god I don't know I'm just here on this boat %HESITATION obsessive thoughts that popped that's all I know so if you get more knowledgeable about things they wanted 
"Where did you have to move in your career, and how did that change things each time?",I moved to la when I was in the military and I'm really happy about that because %HESITATION I keep hearing about America and how it's different in different places so I got to visit the four corners of America and I got to see the different lifestyles so I grew up in Alabama which is like down south on you know black community %HESITATION everybody around me my neighbors everyone was black in them you know you go to school that's next but I don't see that %HESITATION I grew up some of my time in flint Michigan which is %HESITATION %HESITATION very urban place but it's on the poor side so %HESITATION that that glove argued I know about that and %HESITATION when I joined the military then my first school was in a trust in South Carolina which is another down south place but I got to see you know it's looking more or mixed then I went up to New York Albany which nice green country %HESITATION and I got to visit the other New York City you know very often so that was really cool for me %HESITATION to visit such a famous place %HESITATION later on I got station in in San Diego and it's %HESITATION super hot book it's good temperature it can be very hot as opposed to New York which was freezing cold %HESITATION and it's a very big city you know if it's my style of our I'm not I'm not a country backwoods boy you know like I climb mountains and and hunting I I I look city got myself so I got to see San Diego which is like I'm from California recently so that's my tree and then %HESITATION I finally got to visit our remit to Washington which is in %HESITATION down the middle of Washington state and it's it's it's kind of country %HESITATION if you can hold out bigger houses there you know for a much cheaper so it's much less expensive in California and I had a lot of people who to be Californians but then they you know changed over to Washington because the life is life easier they like having of the five bedroom house with a big %HESITATION green yard for the kids to play in and nice and quiet of neighborhoods you know and so on but a lot of people change so I got to see all those and eventually I I realize out of all the places that I visited in America I'm a California 
What do you find unique about your career field?,my career field is very very mean %HESITATION from what I understand sixty percent of the nuclear technicians out there in the world come from the navy so %HESITATION I'm a nuclear technician %HESITATION I don't think that I would have had his training had I not joins the military itself so of being a nuke is very very specific you know that there aren't that many places that have it there is a nuclear power plants %HESITATION up along the edges of America and they're the subs in the ships of the United States Navy so that's where you need to 
Are great practitioners in this field made or born?,great practitioners that this field made or born I would say that it's a little bit of both %HESITATION now there there's some %HESITATION psychology here I I I I I do believe that when you're born you have certain innate abilities comes from your mom and your dad comes from the race on some of us are different skin some of us are taller shorter on some of this argument stronger %HESITATION based on your jeans and I also think that like your mind is on their business it follows the same trait you know like %HESITATION everybody's different %HESITATION some people are our artists when they're born some people are engineers when they're born %HESITATION however it depends on how you grew up so you can take someone who's an artist when you know in in as as as a kid and then you can train them through through their lives to become a great engineer now maybe they might not be the best engineer because it's not in their in their bodies but they can do a good job a great job in fact so on it's a combination of both depends on whom I'm you dad worked %HESITATION hopefully you got that training whatever training that you want to be and later on in life but if you don't then the military who realizes this %HESITATION can train anybody to do anything so some people will have to do a lot more work %HESITATION to achieve their goals on some people can %HESITATION princes joined the nuclear field like I am and you can give respect some people might have to put in the work but regardless of that fact now they can take anybody whether you're an expert from birth or whether you use you need to put some time in it and I'll make sure that you do the pipeline so that you can do the job well 
What priorities would you recommend for a person entering this field?,some of the priorities that I would suggest person when entering the field %HESITATION blow me personally what what I found out that I was going to become a nuke coming to clear technician on I guess I wasn't an adjoining for about seven months or eight months so I took some kidney college classes %HESITATION to kind of brush up on some the physics in the map and I have to tell you that that was %HESITATION a very big benefit %HESITATION I know anything about physics like for instance %HESITATION I didn't know like what happened gravity and shooting bullets and stuff and some uncommon things of that we got the wrong place because I took those college classes that help me prepare myself better to do well in a school that did well in school that you know what set me off on on on the career path later on %HESITATION but it's not just like nuclear technician that could be imprints it's on electronics technician you might want to brush up on some your voltage and you're currently resistors could be a cook might want to brush up on like the different specialties of the it is that's going to be using or you know have some other kids out there like what does it take to to be good at my job %HESITATION so it's just gonna understand the field it's going into and tried to learn about his much of it as you can beforehand 
How fair are the expectations of you as an employee?,so the fairness in the navy %HESITATION it I have to say that the military is fair however they have some some intricacies that I have to say so for instance let's say the economy does poorly then the president is to blame now no one's going to say well you know president you are the one that caused that that entire CD to a %HESITATION be downgraded %HESITATION if it wasn't his job you know like maybe is the president before him however he takes responsibility for so there's a lot of responsibility taking for things that you don't directly control but because it was under your guidance you are the one that %HESITATION could people look to %HESITATION whether it was your fault or not so if a for instance my military unit %HESITATION has many people that aren't physically fit David I think chief what is wrong with your unit now I don't have any excuse I could say well you know I tell them to work out and they just don't listen I can grab him by the collar in like try to run with them black in the ends of the people that are working for you it's there it's in there it's under their cognizance and you you just take responsibility for so is that fair in in many cases you might not think that it is that it is fair but now that's a system that we played by and as long as you're familiar with those rules then that kind of motivates you to be more involved in the in the in the things that your supervisor to make sure that the goal right 
How accepting of failure is this work environment when a good and honest effort was made?,if you try your your best or you follow the directions as good as you can then in our you have my word you have nothing to worry about %HESITATION if if something goes wrong for instance like let's say that there is there's %HESITATION piece of equipment that doesn't work the right way and can complete your mission then of course they they might say you know what like you should have done more for in a man inside or should elect looked at it better but no one's going to fault you for that %HESITATION if for instance %HESITATION so something else goes wrong that you tried your best to complete and %HESITATION if for some reason it doesn't work out the way that you respect then you might get talk to you might get %HESITATION you know because the responsibilities there %HESITATION someone has to blame someone and it could be you but you won't get punished for it which is our something that very proud about %HESITATION for the navy if they're not gonna on then I got a bass people for doing quality work 
What range of tasks and opportunities does this field present to allow me to grow?,so when you come into the military from day one you provided with many opportunities to %HESITATION to grow and expand yourself so even in boot camp %HESITATION some of the attacks that they provide for you %HESITATION that they ask you to do are kind of complex so some people let's say they were really good in in high school it can be very easy for them they understand the math lesson while they understand how how the physics works a %HESITATION type and not %HESITATION but for some people it could be the first time that they've ever seen it in their lives on maybe they've never even been on a ship before you know so be a lot harder for them so %HESITATION the cool thing about the navy is that it gives you all the resources that you need %HESITATION hands down so if you don't need it then you probably won't use it but if you do need it then %HESITATION it's all a matter of asking a chief Hey where can I get help solid matter of going to your local library and getting that look like the biggest thing is that there's gonna be someone to your left and someone to your right that can work with you hand in hand to make sure that you complete your job but the media doesn't want is someone who %HESITATION can't do their job who is trying to do their job because that's gonna get someone killed so they make sure that %HESITATION when it's time to not withstanding a ship what it's going down and %HESITATION and fixing the pump %HESITATION they're gonna make sure that you can complete your job and if there's any questions later then they're not allowed to do it so 
How satisfied have you been with your bosses in your career?,the boss of that I've had in the navy have been %HESITATION buried some of them I've got along with %HESITATION greatly but %HESITATION others the in many cases it it depends on the type of personality that they have and just like with anyone arms you make friends sometimes you make enemies out if you can say that %HESITATION some of the most people are just some of the middle so the people that you would have a beer with %HESITATION inner life are those the people you can joke around with those that you to understand your personality and %HESITATION they're the ones who respect your you work the best %HESITATION however I gotta say that many people think that the military can be political so %HESITATION Francis you could have a rec center that has like four or five people and then you can have a supervisor for them and you can see that the supervisor has a better communication with you know two or three people in the unit so the quiet person who barely ever talks that supervisor to get frustrated in the fact that his work isn't being %HESITATION is it being recognized the way that it's so I've had that personal problems to %HESITATION but it is what it is you just take an average of your whole entire career %HESITATION sometimes going down you know be a superstar sometimes are gonna be kinda like the bottom of the list %HESITATION but for the most part as long as you you present a good effort then you'll be successful and I needed to achieve so it seems like most of what I've been doing a lot with my bosses has been on the positive side of of them 
Describe the technological environment in which you've worked.,not many people can %HESITATION have all of the all of the work the work specialization that I've had %HESITATION I've been down in the plants and I've used lots of different %HESITATION divisiveness principal meter oscilloscope on many things that electricians mates used her check all the lights duh components %HESITATION pumps the bouncing around in %HESITATION other people have in the navy have similar similar stories to %HESITATION 
Describe the technological environment in which you've worked.,so some of the technology that I worked %HESITATION we're done with in my career as a nuclear technician %HESITATION it's kind of divided into two parts on because the nuclear technology Phyllis divide into two parts the first one is electrical things on electricity is made so I used many components like a walk me terrible meter oscilloscope he's all equipment that used up %HESITATION touch things around the plant so I can get readings on them see see what the oil level is see what they're up voltages see what the current us see what the power is %HESITATION so they're really used %HESITATION off throughout America has as electors as me has like treasons use them %HESITATION the other part of my job the nuclear technology field is very very specific most of the time %HESITATION but if you think of Homer Simpson he %HESITATION was a nuclear technologists %HESITATION it's very it only deals with things that %HESITATION the uranium cycle can do to make power so %HESITATION like some of things that I worked on deal with the nuclear part of the aircraft carrier and the way that it makes the ship run so for instance it makes electricians makes electricity things I don't with Bob turbine generators %HESITATION the nuclear field that the nuclear technology there have carried make steam so the steam with power lots of different things all around the ship so on all of the ballots that it takes to make sure that this thing goes the right places products a spin pumps or it's a move the screws up aircraft here so that I can look through the water of those are things that I also dealt with as far as my technology 
What is your opinion on nuclear energy and its future?,with nuclear energy maybe because I have a bias because I went to the program but %HESITATION what's really pushed upon us is that it's very safe it's one of the safest %HESITATION ways to make %HESITATION energy %HESITATION that that we have now there is a concern about nuclear waste and of course you know we we have nuclear waste at the end of the other countries life cycle but it's controlled it's you know in a certain spot and we need %HESITATION put in the middle of the ground as opposed so let's say charcoal which print produces fumes in the air %HESITATION as opposed to %HESITATION sunlight which doesn't provide the energy that it %HESITATION food service here that it has to to produce as much as the %HESITATION nuclear power that is %HESITATION as opposed to women which requires these big things in far off places so nuclear technology that can be built anywhere in the safe manner and in effect the navy has %HESITATION a history of zero incidents of our nuclear failures again in our life so but didn't the navy's crater so we're really proud of that I think that nuclear technology should be the way to go for our future future energy needs however I do understand people's %HESITATION hesitation with taking on nuclear nuclear power especially with the things that happened in Japan by the great Japanese earthquake on into does eleven so it's been a big %HESITATION problem to try to pick up all of the all the pieces there in fact I still have problems it has been you know like on eight years later however that's it took us huge natural disaster to cause a problem that day so whether it's charcoal with its sunlight you know no matter what when you have a big earthquake like that then I think that is going to happen but otherwise nuclear power is one of the safest ways to make managing that I know of on and that's what we talk 
What organizations were most helpful to you in your career?,the organization's most helpful to me %HESITATION number one has to be %HESITATION military healthcare system so %HESITATION I I think I hurt my thumb household like sprained my foot really bad and %HESITATION one thing that you don't really have to worry about being in the military is top of this head to the bottom of your feet it's all taken care of %HESITATION not to pay a little bit more for your family %HESITATION but that the rates are really cheap and %HESITATION it's it's very convenient super comedian %HESITATION another weird thing that I think of another association I think of when I think the military that's actually on our how fun level is in that we are not in the BR I would have a huge a hugely different impression of the military but the throughout my whole entire career if everyone something cool if I ever wanted to bolt if I ever wanted to go hiking skiing camping up there right there super friendly people %HESITATION to make sure that our work outside of our hard military life is rewarded and finally I have to give my credit to the U. S. so whenever I go to an aircraft carrier they're the nicest sweetest people that give me hot dogs and cakes and cookies they provide me a place to sleep they allow me to put my bags down especially when I want to walk around the aircraft here without being over burdened I see other people out there you know like a waiting in these long lines back up against the wall you know with the kids and then I see the U. S. so people of military families have the time of their life you know %HESITATION even though it's a five hour flight so you know that's up to you SO 
What is MWR?,MWR stands for morale recreation and welfare %HESITATION that's basically the military's %HESITATION easier association are you going there you ask him anything from you know hiking the quit mid camping equipment %HESITATION maybe they can so you place to shoot guns they can if they're in a in a foreign country they can tell you all the different places around %HESITATION that you can %HESITATION basically enjoy yourself so princes in San Diego they sold us where Disneyland is Disney world is the world %HESITATION you know how to go to Mexico safely how to go to Las Vegas are all the things that are around the legal and %HESITATION and they also give you cheaper rates usually %HESITATION then civilians can get so basically if you're in any place that has a number of you are that's the first place to go when you want to try to do %HESITATION something find out in the community 
What is USO?,you are so it stands for the United services organization there are I don't specifically know like why they were formed but I I know that a lot of people who are associated with the military before maybe they had %HESITATION maybe they're veterans themselves maybe it's the wife of someone in the military maybe it's %HESITATION someone whose %HESITATION just has a lot of respect for the military like they come in they volunteer their time so show their respective %HESITATION to the military in lots of ways the way that I know is that they're at aircraft here often there at airports and %HESITATION we have a little building up to the side or maybe they're on the second level of the airport where you can go in and you can arrest you can eat some of their food you can have conversations with other people on similar flights and %HESITATION that's really on it's really convenient I'm I'm sure that we do other things as well also I wanna give them credit for that but on the way that I know them is from their support at their at the airports 
What kind of risks do you need to take in this field?,you might want to try to develop yourself into the best sailor that you can be %HESITATION and when you do that when you want to try to do that that means that you have to take on jobs that aren't usually easy so it all began when I joined the join the military at first I had the opportunity to take %HESITATION normal jobs slightly higher jobs and in their most advanced field %HESITATION nuclear technology so that's what I told you I didn't take the easy route and I kids and for me it worked out really well %HESITATION as I became a nuclear technician then Tom lots of jobs start popping up for you so again you have to decide well do I want to have easy lives %HESITATION have have a normal nine to five job to I want to you know go home after midnight or should I try this supervisory position that you know you hear that the have to stay home you have to stay on the ship later theft %HESITATION have more responsibly put on them they're blamed lot more for things %HESITATION so physically have to make your life where some people would say but I think it's just more responsible I'm just like with any job you know the more responsibility you take %HESITATION the more risky capital getting in trouble you know now %HESITATION because you're taking care this work center you blame for that works and if something goes wrong however if you can do your good job and have that work sooner be better because of you you know you can tell the people what to do and they have less of incidence of failure %HESITATION tele like bring your boss down there and say well this is the way it used to be but I told this person to do next personally why and now we have this person's this person is better because of that so now that that supervisor that's afraid you will give you no word for that so the only way to a you know progress yourself to become achieve CG for mass achieve is to put yourself in that role to take on those risks of failure and ultimately reap the rewards 
Should I go to college before or after serving?,I went to college after I did the military %HESITATION I think that that's one way to do it but you have %HESITATION wide range of opportunities for college if you ask if you should go to college before you start serving that depends on what you wanna do if you wanna on how very good enlisted career %HESITATION and you don't plan on becoming an officer then I suggest that you join the military right away officers need a college degree so if you get the cause to be first I then you can become an officer as soon as you join in the military you can like applied to become an officer and every year thereafter however he probably wouldn't start your career four years later you know so that could be a hindrance if you wanna have a full in the secret %HESITATION for people that aren't sure what the what they want to do I still suggest that they join the military right away because you can go to school while you're in the military %HESITATION I took a few classes myself so %HESITATION if you decide that colleges are free of that is that you didn't waste those four years %HESITATION also military can be freed up will in many cases it can be very very cheap they have the stock tuition assistance I can %HESITATION reduce the price by a few thousand dollars from ultimately make it free and you can down take lots of classes during your off time so that means you can kill two birds with one stone looking at the work experience and can do because at night time %HESITATION for some people like me I didn't want the military work so I interfere with my school I want to make aids so that's why you know I want to go to school the entire time that I was in the military I waited until I got out so so I could use them on damage ideal so I can go to a very expensive university it's that I can really focus on my public school without worrying about work in the mill so between going to school in the beginning if one become an officer when school during your career if you're thinking about making the military for itself for doing college at the very very end up so you can enjoy the mother which I build the nine eleven personal though post nine eleven benefits and all the free stuff %HESITATION yet to decide where you fit in that range 
How can your work change the world?,I think that that maybe can change the world the military can change the world and ultimately America can change the world if we use that's a huge %HESITATION money that was bidding for the military wisely so America spends I think what six hundred billion dollars per year which is from what I understand like us several times more than any other country %HESITATION it's made for the next six countries combined total of that's what the military skins so what are using that money for %HESITATION I would say that it's police in the world we we make sure that we have a huge military so that there are huge fights breaking out all over the world like %HESITATION use that the you know two hundred three hundred years ago on because there wasn't a main force then you have England attack France Iraq attack Saudi Arabia I'm making up countries but you understand that there's a there wasn't a global force for good kind of making sure that everybody isn't going crazy with all the taxes so yes America does attack itself to and %HESITATION there's there's an ideology behind that but ultimately as long as %HESITATION America can control the huge fights that break out then I'd say that people for the most part in most countries will and it will appreciate that protection that were providing

Anything else?,
What’s your favorite book of all time? Why?,my favorite book of all time I have to say is Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse's so I I grew up reading mythology Arabic mythology and %HESITATION and maybe magic books and some of those sports a few sports books %HESITATION lots of fables and has up Spaceballs so that's what got me to read %HESITATION but I didn't really I don't see any very very substantial work that you know sold lots of intelligence and %HESITATION Hermann Hesse's work Siddhartha was %HESITATION just what I needed to realize that you know there are some really bright people out there we've added I am you can think of some kind of plot %HESITATION that's very interesting engaging and %HESITATION Siddhartha so that the person the main text of the story is a lot like me he's integrated he's whining about his future %HESITATION he travels the world looking for some kind of solution and %HESITATION the solution is it answers given in the book I don't know if it's a look a solution but %HESITATION it made me really %HESITATION self interest back alive and %HESITATION started so read Haldeman has his work later on pans out most of it just blew me away so it's a good introduction to a very intelligent reading 
What’s your favorite movie of all time? Why?,I like a lot of the pop the pop movies you know like a Titanic Braveheart forced on you know like a lot of the blockbusters but I have to say that my favorite movie of all time is actually not even the movie and anime from Japan I'm in Japan so I you see lots of enemy and many of them are good but one blows everything out the water berserk is a movie about a if this medical times and %HESITATION there's this character %HESITATION that's is really strong and you know he wants that %HESITATION find its own personal battles you know I go by himself but not really think about anything no purpose but he needs this person Griffin who's very charismatic and he he has this huge goal so like on his own kingdom and god sees this so our he follows them and you know there's there's lots of romance there lots of leading guides lots of %HESITATION lots of intellectual conversation and %HESITATION leader not I actually thought about my own life very much so do this movie so in hats off to those guys who made that really bright will be and 
"If you could meet anyone in the world today, who would it be and why? What would you say to that person?",if I could anyone in the world then I think it would have to be Sam Harris %HESITATION a lot of people I respect there's a Stephen Hawking lose I really great guy I'm actually working on a project here at my computer science that can help him speak %HESITATION they're smart guys like us Neil degrasse Tyson he's a physicist %HESITATION whose are really bright he he I just %HESITATION narrated the most recent cosmos about the planets in the world are just like Carl Sagan did back in the days of really really bright guy but %HESITATION those are the people that can it's me something %HESITATION I don't think that I could provide anything to them %HESITATION I don't think that your conversations with you're on the same plane let Sam Harris is %HESITATION he's a person who kinda like Richard docking %HESITATION dockings that he he's an atheist and he %HESITATION has ideas about like on different religions and %HESITATION he's also like a computer scientist who has ideas about %HESITATION artificial intelligence %HESITATION he has lots of different Dr to talk about I think you can make for excellent conversation umpire I disagree with him a lot about a lot of things and I think that you could actually change my mind about a lot of things which is the home I wanna meet him 
What kind of personal satisfaction do you get from your job?,yeah lots of personal satisfaction from my job %HESITATION course the salary is %HESITATION is no joke I have to make decent money %HESITATION enough to live and love to support myself but the skills that they provide there really go pretty far %HESITATION whenever I I mean to the type of work that I do %HESITATION people's eyes light up and they makes me really proud of of being able to say that I work with nuclear technology %HESITATION other other sources of pride come in the fact that %HESITATION it's not everybody that can actually like push an aircraft here through the water and I can actually say that my hands touched something that made this huge you know multibillion dollar piece of equipment go through the water to fight a war he was me if I you know to sit this way it would've stopped code did it this way then it goes fast you know so that's that's a once in a lifetime experience and eventually 
What qualifications and experience do recruiters look for when choosing new people for this field?,when recruiters look for new people to come and join the navy and they're looking for special special ideology I'm not a skill set %HESITATION you can come in with nothing you can come in with the GT you come in with sees like I did up from high school and they will train you that's not the problem the ideology that we talk about is the fact that you need to be able to follow instructions so for instance if I you always got in trouble %HESITATION all the time and you can follow the rest of them that is like a kid %HESITATION a lot of people that would have went to jail you know the the still join the military but because %HESITATION the judge thinks that they have the potential to follow directions if if in the right situation so column the biggest the biggest quality that recruiters look for when they ask people to join the navy it is I really do what I tell you to do leader which is supervisor tell you to do are you going to be drunk to get kicked out of military right away %HESITATION if you were if you like to sexually harass people then that's a big no no you know so some of those kind of moral someone to follow directions what they're looking for 
What do you see as the major problems for those working in this field today?,the major problem that I see military people have been working in the field today is that they can probably expects a gold so more warriors if %HESITATION our current leadership doesn't take the right actions to prevent that we're we're supposed to be policing the world in a way that prevents large drawn out worse but unfortunately %HESITATION with a lot of things that are happening in the yellow sea right now with a lot of things happened with %HESITATION both crea with their buildup of their of their weapon arsenal %HESITATION with some the things going on in the Middle East %HESITATION we can see that the police that were doing isn't isn't fully effective in the way that we're seeing decreases in the level of violence around the world gradually seeing you know the same or even more than that when I was in in the military so that's they could be something that we can afford to in in the military 
What person do you most admire and why?,in my profession as an electrician I look up to a lot of people %HESITATION at least in my rec center of course I I'm always going to be turning to that first right beside me the senior chief or even the master chief of the command to kind of give me directions so I can like a become a better chief myself %HESITATION I expect them to tell me when I'm messing up expect them to come to correct me and a lot of situations and to give me lots of advice so palm in my work center and it's going to be the next person next unless a person in front of me %HESITATION however as electricians I also have a lot of respect for the academic side of of the science so friends is what I've read about things are we about nuclear technology things and whatever improving %HESITATION from MIT from Berkeley her from other places that you know promote nuclear technology then I'm really proud of them as well and that's why I started becoming a university stood myself because I want to follow in that direction I see our our car tech are engineering field is our has a lot of room to expand and I want to be a part of that so I look the people promoting %HESITATION engineering in a marvelous 
Tell me a funny story.,one of the fun stories that I have was when I was in Australia I started I started to gamble I never gambled before I wanted to %HESITATION see if I coulda take one thousand dollars and make ten thousand dollars I said you know I'm going to this OP five star hotels you don't count gambling on the bottom and %HESITATION I said I can stop it ten thousand dollars that's enough for a car I will come back and I will have I won't gamble anymore I'll go out into the world %HESITATION I had this trick that I could do for roulette which is %HESITATION like to take one dollar and if you lose it when you get two dollars if you lose in the death for us if you lose the bet eight dollars and eventually you away you gonna win you know even if you lose lose lose lose lose lose lose lose lose if you win on that ten times longer you keep doubling then use it like a get all your money back in and you know so anyways I tried this trick so we went to Australia and %HESITATION I was down in the bottom of the hotel and I was there for maybe seven hours six hours how my roulette so it's not up with a hundred actually did it Black Jack and I got its like two three hundred and I sighed roulette you know with my special trick and I got it up so to two thousand dollars so my arm away you know it it actually does work %HESITATION so I went up to my my room for that Nietos drinking champagne in the bathtub like watching TV you know and then I thought millet leader second I'm in Australia I think did you just spend your whole day %HESITATION in the gambling in a little you know off to the side hotel and gambling spot you know like like to gamble in Las Vegas come on you know you should %HESITATION you seek it out there and try to %HESITATION explore the countries on so the next day I go back down there and it's so funny there's this old lady who was there she was there the night before here I I I went up to you know like you can navigate and I came back on his heels still gambling right so %HESITATION she was gambling on the hundred dollar tip tables and before I was doing like ten ten dollar cable side like you know it she is my money let me go ahead and you know I gotta tell you this ten thousand dollars is cast as possible so I go to right decidedly as you go into a table start getting hundred dollars honey dollars underdog is all done book by two thousand dollars I mean I I left and I enjoyed it Australia so I like that story because it taught me to not be scared of losing money but he did have that power over me that I did when I was when I was a kid 
Where were you born?,I was born in Gardena California 
What is Japan like?,for me has been one of the most awesome experiences of my life this is the third time that have come here on the first was with the military I want to settle which is at the very bottom of Japan %HESITATION kind of like a country version of Japan but I did go to a big city Fukuoka and it was really been a really huge they have amazing stores on their electronics store that I went to it was he had like ten floors and one of the floors is like Best Buy in America Best Buy is America's %HESITATION most most most he had the most electronic stuff that America can provide and it's on one big you know humans floor but Japan has even those guys like if you want a camera at Best Buy well here's a stand you know you can see below there fifty cameras all cool known though you haven't seen cameras to you go to Japan where they have an entire section of the floor devoted to cameras you want a laptop located at the you know Best Buy has low there's there's the apple section there's like you know twenty to twenty laptops over there now you know Japan is the place they so %HESITATION as far as the food goes I switch over it when I'm in America I love ice cream when I'm in Japan switches over Cerami Rahman is the best delicious food that is everyone into my body it's so good %HESITATION there's one time eight Rahman every single day %HESITATION also enemy is %HESITATION it's abundant over here so I don't really watch enemy here amazing that what's in a name or any about America than here it's kind of kid like here but %HESITATION you see it all no no no no places like I won every walking down the street you can see like a cartoon figure and all the characters you know they have places like now I know you have to you have to go visit it it's so %HESITATION just being in this different culture it's way different in America and I'm thinking it 
What do you do in computer science/programming?,science is broken up into basically two different forms are the first one is computer science itself which is %HESITATION everything that's associated with the laptop that's in front of you that includes the theory that's behind it %HESITATION duh abstractions that are associated with thinking about the way that you know computers should work that involves our electronics that are behind it %HESITATION you open up the computer and you can see the mother boards to the if there's you can see the current that's traveling through it was that the hardware question that's the thing that's on the screen that deals with web design that deals with %HESITATION the way that the colors look %HESITATION also %HESITATION graphics that's %HESITATION how the light comes from the computer and get your eyes %HESITATION there's the user experience part which is %HESITATION when you have buttons all over the screen and %HESITATION maybe this button shouldn't be like here maybe people wanted bigger or smaller on maybe the one on the other side screen maybe I think that it's boring but if you change in a certain way that it's more fun also that's all of that combined is computer science but what most people think about when they think of computer science is actually the coding part coding is what happens when you have your laptop open you open up the program you start pushing buttons on your computer screen to write lines of code so that when you compiled you press play it does something for you so for instance you can make a game to compile the game and also to play the game or you can make %HESITATION you can start coding in they would press play yet you have Microsoft Word on based on the court that you wrote so that's what most people think about when they think of computer science I think of the program that's associated with the computer science is a very broad rings 
What is your strategy for overcoming your hardships?,when there's something that's that's really difficult there's some kind of obstacle in in my life then the thing that I fall back to most are the people around me which is my my my friends %HESITATION and a lot of people they have a family to support them on the fortune that don't have any family that's around me but I do have a close group of friends that I can confide in whenever something let me 
What advice do you have for someone who is growing up surrounded by drugs and crime when sometimes it seems like it's too hard to get through school?,advice that I could prison to somebody who went through %HESITATION tough life %HESITATION similar to me and my life was an extremely tough it's the way that I look at it %HESITATION other people would say that I had a tough life I mean that's I seem roaches in my bathroom I've had my scroll over my feet I love him I've smelled gunpowder you know from outside I've %HESITATION had left him you don't hit his prostitute outside my door %HESITATION these are things that I've experienced and %HESITATION I gotta say you know isn't as much is as strong as I want to be %HESITATION floor saying you know it didn't affect me I strong flavor I think that you know you really changed my life and I I know that a lot of people %HESITATION especially ones that join the military have had similar careers you know my story is not unique so I think one of the things that has helped me %HESITATION in order to look at my past better is to have different experiences another thing that I'm proud of is the fact that my dad was in the army and I got to go to Germany so just being in that other environment on being surrounded by German kids needing to speak the German language %HESITATION you know even bratwurst you don't like having that different spirits allow me to come back to flint and say you know what there this isn't like this is one part of why %HESITATION but there are people in Florida are you know going to Disneyland people in Germany %HESITATION you know doing October cast that people and out Japan you know eating Ramanan watching anime this is just one small sliver and if you can somehow escape from that environment or even maybe do something within that environment to make it better you don't then you can see that on that you don't have to be heartened by year by your surroundings he says what you make of it 
Were you ever bullied in high school? What did you do? ,when I was a kid I used to wear these glasses has to be a lot skinnier than I am %HESITATION are big chubby guy now but %HESITATION Palestine your scrawny nerd so %HESITATION I had my two or three friends you know we used to play video games and doesn't drag us all the time and %HESITATION yeah you know that that that's right taken for for bullies %HESITATION but I think I've been in you know a couple fights in my life just barely you know like a good little scoffs and no big deal %HESITATION however I happen to think that I I was at least a decent looking enough so where are we gross what kinda like me too so I I didn't it didn't really affect my my personal you know my personal I give myself %HESITATION I just thought well you know it when you have when you get older %HESITATION I don't have a good job but I have a nice cars and you know so the blues are picking on me you know it's our the pride of DB from losers later on in life worth that that's the way that I thought when I was younger so %HESITATION 
What advice do you have for people who are being bullied in high school?,vice that I have for someone being bullied on it depends on how you want to look at it %HESITATION my advice that I did for myself blows ideas start stating my own little world %HESITATION yeah I wasn't very sociable and as a kid but %HESITATION something else that I did that actually changed it I don't suggest this but this is this is what will happen for me and it stopped me from being bullied was that I change myself %HESITATION I realize that %HESITATION after I put in context with it into government glasses start working out you know I was working I was on the track and field club so I ran all the time in notice my boss is getting bigger my chest you know I could do you know signalman you know had a six pack you know I realize that after I did that all of the billing stocks %HESITATION I don't suggest that because he should be whoever you you want to be on I mean because I can change myself like that to stop the killing I thought I thought to myself because that's the person that I wanted to be that I had like you know like not having glasses you know hurt my notes I like Donna working out because of me you know more energetic but %HESITATION when you stay yourself whether you have a different prison out you know you change your your look and your feel on all that doesn't matter the only thing that exists suggest if you can believe it it is to realized that %HESITATION you're somebody that you gonna be somebody great later on in life if you if you apply yourself and to not let those words 
Do you have a family?,currently at the moment I don't have any close people around me I don't really have a family %HESITATION of course everybody has a mom and a dad but %HESITATION I like so many other military had %HESITATION dysfunctional family when I was growing up my mom and my dad split when I was young and so I had to live with my mom's mom my dad's mom my mom and my dad if it did that again you know so I live with each of them like to use to use to your tears them do that one more time and then when I was eighteen I kind of just went my own way and I didn't really talk to them anywhere 
What advice do you have for spouses who don't understand the career demands of the Navy?,if you have a spouse %HESITATION husband or wife or even %HESITATION another Flickinger girlfriend clear very close to who doesn't really understand the requirements of the navy I would suggest that the military person %HESITATION present them with some of the support that the military provides yeah MWR morale recreation work welfare that %HESITATION can show the spouse or significant other %HESITATION number one ways that they can divert themselves if you're a sick husband is out into the ocean you could buy yourself very bored you can find yourself wanting to be around them to call them all the time so in that regard and so you like how the like of mingle with other military people with other military spouses with other people in the community to kinda like take your mind off them %HESITATION they can also provide them with legal support yeah if they're running into some problems while the the husband or wife is away so as long as the military person shows the spouse %HESITATION our support then did they shouldn't they can overcome their problems 
Did you like wearing the same uniform every day? Why or why not?,personally I love wearing this uniform in particular of the reason I love this uniform is because %HESITATION it doesn't need to be ironed to tell you the truth you just throw it in the wash machine and then as soon as it comes out uses and put it on a hanger and then %HESITATION that's ready to wear %HESITATION sometimes I earned it %HESITATION just to make sure there's absolutely no wrinkles wrinkles %HESITATION pieces wrinkles but I I I think that it's very warm I like the way that it looks and it's very easy to maintain 
What is a regulator?,so a regulator on it has different meanings the pinning on what type of job you're doing so if you ask %HESITATION mechanic what irregular areas it's something that regulates some kind of flow so for instance you have water going in this direction and then you yeah maybe turn a switch or apply some %HESITATION some setting to a control mechanism that separated into different different paths so let's see needed a little bit of water in you have a lot of water here then you regulate it so that only a little bit close out but let's say you need lots of what it could be regulated so that there's lots of water that comes out so the same thing happens with %HESITATION electricians my job we have voltage regulators so %HESITATION let's see have let's say a pump that needs twenty goals and you have a machine that can provide all that you just don't wanna pop all of the current from that machine into that little little box right so you have a regulator that provides the right voltage out so that that that will just allow the correct current to go through that machine that's simple speculative 
Tell me about Naval Post Graduate School.,the naval postgraduate school is basically the navy's main school for officers who probably came from enable academy or maybe ROTC %HESITATION that are advanced in their career enough maybe after four years or six years to go back to graduate school so %HESITATION %HESITATION forget it an advanced degree so they allow Masseria's courses and things from column security so %HESITATION column operations management %HESITATION been mislead lots of war things %HESITATION I was thinking about going there myself to %HESITATION get a degree in modeling virtual environments and simulation it's computer science field but there there are things like that applied math %HESITATION things that keep our navy in tip top shape for the people that are really controlling things at that level 
Where is the Naval Post Graduate School,four officers who I came from enable academy or maybe ROTC %HESITATION that 
What are the most important things on a resume?,the most important things that you can put on a resume are number one %HESITATION how you worked as a team concerning the job is being applied for so for instance if I was applying to be a mechanic on a submarine then I have to look at my past and say okay we'll what things are associated with the submarine right and then thought that I that I did in my past life and then how did it work as a team to make that project better so maybe you are where a car mechanic before and you're trying to type is what job did you guys talk about the other teammates on your on your car engineer team that you love that you talk to that you provided support to that you supervised and %HESITATION and obviously the dates because so that they need to see that you have a big range of experience 
Where can I find an internship that will give me skills for the engineering field?,there are many opportunities for internships %HESITATION if you're going into the stem built %HESITATION I know that I had an internship myself at the department of defense I worked at the %HESITATION %HESITATION naval training station in Orlando and out his my first %HESITATION internship %HESITATION give we dealt with computer science I was working on %HESITATION making %HESITATION speech more understandable for computer as you talk to it %HESITATION so it does really good so I think the department of defense I think you just Google guilty %HESITATION internships and press enter and then there's five the whole first feature be lots of different %HESITATION postings for you %HESITATION so at every military installation I was in California that that corona at San Diego swore makes had %HESITATION and even %HESITATION the San Diego naval base this probably is some opportunity for each high school students and college graduates to get a little bit of taste %HESITATION of what the federal government with the military can offer for military purposes 
What do you advise me to do in picking the right career field for me?,the best information that I could give you if you're trying to understand what you should do so of for your future career is to learn as much information about it as possible %HESITATION so for for me I don't mean nuclear technician field and I didn't even know what they did I I thought we were going to clear bombs and I think if I would have known a little bit more about it %HESITATION then I would've had better to jump start from a career %HESITATION so for instance if I knew about like %HESITATION that the nuclear technology field dealt with dot internals of of of making nuclear power with uranium then I would study more about that and my schooling would had a better %HESITATION I would've understood my schooling a lot better %HESITATION if I would have picked up a little bit of electricity knowledge beforehand like for instance I did I had no idea what the difference would we'll do some current was %HESITATION until I was midway in my in my school my initials school learning so %HESITATION give be really nice if I would have a list of some of those basic concepts before I started to school might result in higher I was done more wards %HESITATION maybe I would've understood them material that complex material that was being presented to me enough much in a much better way if I would've had like fifty or sixty percent knowledge beforehand so I would have missed out out on those like on those minor %HESITATION advanced topics during class so I guess my advice is to learn about your job before you go into it 
How do I find what I love to do?,trying to find what you love to do %HESITATION it has to brought answers for me the first of which is you hear this very often follow your passion %HESITATION so personally my passenger was %HESITATION music in our %HESITATION I was an engineer person %HESITATION per se %HESITATION when I was a kid all the way up until %HESITATION a couple years after I joined the navy that's right I joined as and as an engineer and I wasn't an engineer until after I got my first ship IT to tell you I didn't even %HESITATION like it too much I like talking language is you know conversing with people and you know writing stuff type on the computer I I I did not want to see oil I did not want to touch a rich you know that was it for me but %HESITATION in the ends it brings me to my second point %HESITATION tried to become really good at the skills that you possess so %HESITATION for me I think I'm a good electricity I became a supervisor after some time and %HESITATION it's not because I had a passion for electricians electricity things it's because I found that I was good at it and as they gave me motivation to learn more and more about it and once I started doing that in and after becomes easy for you %HESITATION then you can start explaining things really well you can start reading a book and and learning more about it really well you start getting awards for it you start %HESITATION you know wanting to know more about it so %HESITATION yeah all those two things follow your passion and if that's not for you then follow the skills that are provided to you 
What should I do if I don’t know what job I want to do?,if you don't know what job you wanted to and my suggestion is that tried to push yourself to try to do %HESITATION as hardly job it's possible %HESITATION you can always go down blade in many cases it's very hard to go up so for instance if you pick a simple job like let's say %HESITATION picking plants I I don't mean to discredit any time pickers out there but if your job is to pick plants and then all of sudden you want to be a computer scientist let's say %HESITATION it might be hard to a try to make that switch %HESITATION you don't have the skills to do computer science you don't have the the background you don't might might have the right of way to think about the world however I think as a computer scientists if I wanted to I could be a very very good that picture so you can always go down %HESITATION but it's hard to look 
Who are the best people to talk to when making a career choice?,yes people to talk to if you're unsure about what you want to do is %HESITATION people in the field if you can so I know many people will ask their their dad Hey dad so I joined the navy %HESITATION and I got to see if your dad has never been in the navy then although his advice %HESITATION should be consider it %HESITATION he might not know what he's talking about %HESITATION the best thing to do would be to ask someone who's been in the military and the longer the time the better so for instance are you don't want to ask because in job we just got back from boot camp what the military's like it's pie not gonna give you a week ago fully formed answer when asked %HESITATION senior chief who and give you a from the outside ends does deployments to that war is to that sitting at home %HESITATION took along the east to the long nights today easy vacation the full spectrum so get people with experience the best advice by your current career the person that gave me the best advice about joining the military I have to say would be my father he was in the army and %HESITATION although I I never saw him while he was at work will just barely was as a kid you know I sit in the corner playing video games gameboy %HESITATION but he did tell me %HESITATION you know when he came home what is Dave was like he'd say %HESITATION some things about the work they have to do that TT that he had to do people get to supervise arm also saw the type of life that we live I know that like was it very nice clean environment I he showed me his corvette outside that foreskin a few times %HESITATION he died we could always be going on vacations and he'd tell me like are these are the benefits that are associated with the military any heed develop my my pride in them and Millie recently joined later on you know if if he would've been in the army maybe out to say that I would enjoy myself but military families have a high %HESITATION I read a lot of convincing other people around him to join 
What is one piece of advice that you wished you had taken?,so one thing that I regret %HESITATION when I was growing up is that %HESITATION how does a really good student when I was out again television school when I was in middle school and even high school then things started to kind of fall often and we do a I didn't have a strong relationship with my family so I kinda just did my own thing I was very independent and unfortunately I wasn't really good at doing homework and stuff so I yeah I got first half in my life when I was a senior first these you know like all is a junior and you know I mean it it if I would have just kept being and possums did %HESITATION throughout high school inclusive say that my life would know we did it in a completely different direction %HESITATION if I could have wound up that I have neither the school or something about who who's who knows but because I didn't listen to my mom and dad tell me to do my homework and you don't eat my vegetables yeah no I I I had I was almost forced to join the military %HESITATION I'm glad that I did join the military he gave me an option so you know make something of myself but %HESITATION I think it had a lot more opportunities if I would have to my parents 
What is one question you wish you had asked earlier?,when I was a kid I went to the library one day and I %HESITATION I got this book and it sold me all the salaries that out people make %HESITATION how I was a musician at that time I had ever played any new music I instrument but like I knew that you know like I was really involved in music and I have wanted to so then I know I saw how much musicians making very very low and %HESITATION miss okay one artist at least you know like media about trying to get my heart is tree for my mom and I look at their salaries very low so then I set that book and then now I kind of gave up on looking at salaries for awhile %HESITATION a question that I would have a question that I wish I would ask someone %HESITATION it is what are the different salaries that people can make and how can I become more involved in getting those high paying but those sightings jobs and not only that %HESITATION let's say I wanted to get artist or a musician how do I enter that feel I'll be discouraged by their salaries so how how how how how can I follow my passion without being disheartened by by financial figures 
What is something you wish you had known before choosing your career or major?,something I wish I would have known before I I chose nuclear technology is how cool computer science could be %HESITATION when I was a kid I just thinking computer science let you know they they type all day and it is like ones and zeroes in %HESITATION it's it's it's terrible and you know lots of mapping very complex for no reason %HESITATION that that's what I thought but %HESITATION after I got out did I realize will wait a second I can make games and it's it's not that difficult you know their tools to help you so I can not dealing with ones and zeroes can deal with like normal conversation when you code all men so I Lisa number one I wish my dad would buy me a computer when I was a kid and that didn't happen so number two before I joined %HESITATION %HESITATION meekly tech as a nuclear technologists you know its implications and I wish out some would have told me about other computer science because that's what I'm doing now that's my past
