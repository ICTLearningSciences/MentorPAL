Where did you grow up?,I grew up in Los Angeles California I was born there I moved around when I was %HESITATION younger but I need to graduate from high school in California 
Tell me about your childhood.,so I have a child that's pretty similar to many military people that I meet %HESITATION when I was young my parents divorced on my father he was in the army so I can see him that much I live with my mother for a long time we moved from our state to state I lived in Washington for awhile I lived in Alabama for awhile %HESITATION it inside moved back with my father instead of my mother %HESITATION in California so actually seen a lot of America %HESITATION things to their divorce eventually I %HESITATION graduated from high school %HESITATION and after high school me my father we can really get along so %HESITATION I broke away from him and a couple of years afterwards I realize that %HESITATION I needed some kind of odd jobs help me help me with my my finances help me you know find some kind of direction in life so that's when I joined the US navy reserve and the US 
Tell me about your family.,I had a great opportunity to know most of my family throughout my life and my parents were divorced so that means that I spent sometime with my mother's family sometime with my father's family %HESITATION sometime with my father is mother and sometimes with my mother's mother so I bounced around from %HESITATION household to household when I was a you John I didn't really for any strong bonds with anyone but I did get an opportunity to see most of the world so I spent a couple years with my grandmother in Alabama %HESITATION so I got to shoot a few guns there and got to climb mountains in %HESITATION do all of that country stuff that you know lot of people are coming to a meeting with %HESITATION I just also live in Michigan around it's kind of an impoverished area if you %HESITATION been watching movies and things that I you but I know about this but %HESITATION it's %HESITATION it's develop my character in in a lot of ways %HESITATION eventually I finally moved to California and I have to say out of all the places that I've been all over America California is the right place to be it has a temperature that I want the people of diversity I want so maybe from now on I'll always stay in California 
Can you tell me more about Michigan?,in Michigan %HESITATION it's the place that I stayed had %HESITATION a diverse amount of people but %HESITATION it was mostly a crime ridden in some places %HESITATION I've seen lots of %HESITATION things that you see on movies for instance about drug use %HESITATION some violence here and there %HESITATION I've seen more graphic things like I prostitution in a homeless shelter is things like that %HESITATION but those are things that I think maybe turned me into wanting to help my society a little bit more those are negative things these are things that kind of pushed me into wanna make the world a better place because I saw so even though Michigan was at the part that I grew up in a flint isn't that up you know ideal city it is a good place to grow up and develop to develop your character 
What kind of student were you?,so that type of student I was in in college in high school and an elementary school it very he was kinda like a sine wave so when I was in elementary school I was the tasks and %HESITATION there was that it was like very very high achieving something like that %HESITATION I was scored really high on my queue %HESITATION so I I got the impression that I was really bright kid %HESITATION in high school you kind of get down I was a little bit more independent I stopped doing my homework I stopped listening to teachers are starting out with friends a lot more so mind you know four point goes in three point eight study going down to %HESITATION you know very very low umps that's one of the reason that I didn't go to college right away on I think many people in the nuclear field like I'm in had a very similar story I think more than half the people have that story their brightest kids like the %HESITATION cut somehow lost their way ended up going to need college and then going to the military or %HESITATION or some some some situation so %HESITATION going through the military actually helped me out a lot because it taught me a lot of self discipline lot of %HESITATION reasons to you get motivated to study a lot so after I %HESITATION finish my active duty navy career going back to college and I was on part I started doing well with it's much that I was given 
When did you join the Navy?,I joined the navy in two thousand and eight 
When did you join the Navy?,I joined the navy in two thousand that was right before we had the nine eleven attacks I was there for eight years and then I joined the US navy reserve in two thousand and eight 
Are you currently serving in the military?,right now I'm currently serving as the chief elections may what the US Naval Reserve I did active duty as %HESITATION electricians mate as well but that was under the nuclear field right now because you can't really service %HESITATION in the nuclear field as a reservist %HESITATION I'm just a normal lectures and 
What is your current rank and duty position now?,right now I'm a chief in the paper a scale that some E. seven there E. one three nine eight grades %HESITATION for enlisted and it's on the seventh level 
"Besides LA, what other places in California have you lived in?",sites Los Angeles I've lived all up and down the coast of %HESITATION of California so I grew up in Los Angeles that's where I graduated from high school at and then after I did my need your tour in the navy %HESITATION I went to college in the San Francisco area macaws was Berkeley which is right across the bay during my maybe stand on the city to San Diego so I've had %HESITATION maybe two or three years and all of those cities those of the major cities of California 
"Having just joined the Navy, how did the 9-11 attacks effect you?",so after I joined the military two thousand I went to school for almost six months for a school on that's your initial training in six more months at nuclear power school so during that time %HESITATION while I was %HESITATION in school I remember walking downstairs and %HESITATION I forget his name very he was watching the TV and it was like look at this and I solid attacks happening on the screen %HESITATION I lived in New York at the time in Albany so it's %HESITATION just a few hours from where I was staying %HESITATION I was just about to go to my first US ships so I you know obviously %HESITATION is going to be a pretty big impact %HESITATION to the new people that were there so we were all called in from school and they kind of looked at us and %HESITATION make sure that we had there Mister that none of the other tack happening in it's home %HESITATION but a few months later for my first ship I was actually flown out to the USS John C. Stennis in the middle of the war so %HESITATION from day one %HESITATION I was pretty much fighting the war 
"Having just joined the Navy, how did the 9-11 attacks effect you?",so nine eleven attacks had a really big impact on my naval career I just joined the navy in two thousand and we're going to school we did six months of a school your basic military training call for elections maids then I was in power school nuclear power school where we learned theory of nuclear power now it wasn't up in Albany New York so the nine eleven attacks happens in %HESITATION it in the lower part of New York where %HESITATION that the planes were attacking buildings they were %HESITATION flown by terrorists and %HESITATION into the world trade centers and I was three hours north of that so I was I remember walking downstairs and my roommate was watching the TV he said Hey take a look at this and I saw what was going on and I lose them yet is because when I have a big effect on the rest of my life so they called us in out to make sure that all the students were okay and I remember a couple of months after that you know it's been sold out to my first aircraft your %HESITATION fleshly plowed hunting helicopter in the middle of the the Gulf %HESITATION %HESITATION wears supporting the Middle East functions over there we are %HESITATION they are marines there army people were longer support from the aircraft carriers that %HESITATION USS John C. Stennis ship that was on life support and stuff from that point on I guess we're fighting wars for the next eight years I did three deployments out there all based on that first nine eleven attack 
What was it like being in war? What did you do?,so during work time many people do many things %HESITATION for the navy not everyone it's it's a guy or not everyone %HESITATION does physical training every day you know it's not it's not exactly what you see in the military %HESITATION for the most part many people or maybe even even based on ships did was supporting type of role the ones who actually fight the wars are basically the officers who were in the jets and then they go drop bombs on the places %HESITATION they always say that for the navy that's the safest place to be during the war because no one's ever gonna fight you you know you're in the middle of the ocean in the middle of the Atlantic so my job specifically was so well the ship around Tom that means I I was distraught woman which means that I was like on the gas pedal of the ship I also did %HESITATION preventive maintenance on the pumps on the reduction gears and as an electrician's mate I worked on the electrical portions of the show which means men I think slides I %HESITATION fix poems and you know things like that so my basic roller support as is the majority of maybe keep 
What was it like being in war? (short version),during wartime that temple is a lot higher than it than it normally is so I thought in the Iraq war in the Afghanistan war and during those times we're in the middle of the ocean %HESITATION and these were pretty long from six AM so sometimes midnight very very often %HESITATION you did so much training it was %HESITATION he was a very trying time but is also rewarding because %HESITATION your your patience is tested your drive and motivation is tested %HESITATION and you keep eventually you fight the war and and you can you do a lot of the things so that I can actually wear socks 
"""I want to join the Navy but I'm afraid of going into battle...""",so joining the military is a dangerous career %HESITATION if you want to join the navy but you're scared of one battle then they're obviously jobs for you but you have to inherently realize that %HESITATION being in the military is %HESITATION by definition a dangerous career so I was on the ship for the most of the time like they could have sent me anywhere so you have to be will take that that %HESITATION however even on the ship on there are dangers %HESITATION for instance should be %HESITATION telling the ships where to go like they say that the top of the aircraft carrier is one of the most interesting is that be it's one of the most it's jobs %HESITATION additionally %HESITATION if what you're back home %HESITATION you with your family you have a normal job but they could say Hey you know what we need more people out there in the field so I'm thinking it's call you and you can be you know with the with the army people with the marines people on fighting wars on but for the most part %HESITATION the airforce and the navy they tend to have supporting roles to dog army and the marines 
"Though you were an Electricians Mate, did you work on other things besides electronics?",so my job as an MC elections made is to %HESITATION fixed fonts to a different maintenance to %HESITATION working voltage regulators to have lots of training as well but the navy also provides you with %HESITATION releases from your job if you do the same job the whole entire time you might get kind of %HESITATION frustrated so %HESITATION I actually worked in the supply department which is where %HESITATION for instance there is the veins in the shop and there's like painting that needs to be done %HESITATION there's lots of cleaning that has to be done %HESITATION some people work on the in the tech pubs library which means that %HESITATION there's their books for everybody on the ship that has to do the job so young you can work there for awhile so I'm basically for about six months to a year if you work in your main job and then they kind of give you a break even though you're on the same and then you you have that cycle so you %HESITATION grows doing something different 
What is the training progression and what is it like?,so with the navy they always give you training that's something that's going to be ingrained in your heart by the end of year in the tour so that you believe that the training is that we have one of the people in in your unit %HESITATION glove and provide something from a book that you probably learn in a school that you probably learn on the job %HESITATION so for instance the diagram of the reactor and was also known for instance all the valves that are there which was no %HESITATION what to do in case of a casualty if there's a fire in one of the pumps we have to say well you're supposed to turn off %HESITATION now a BNC and then %HESITATION call it in and then we'll tell the watch officer and then ask somebody to help me go back and fight the fire what happens if there is like on a radiation still Reese was it you know do these things so for instance every time that you have a cavity which means that there is a problem in the ship beat a fire a flood %HESITATION scramble the reactor which means it breaks down then you have to know what each of those steps are and after being in the navy for what a year let's say %HESITATION if you don't train about it then you're going to forget it solely the allow a little bit of forget and then the train on it so you remember it then you have that cycle of training over and over and over 
What is A school?,a school just like it says is the basic got a school that you go to %HESITATION it provides you the initial training %HESITATION that it's possible to so I'm in the clear lecture since may %HESITATION for me I do the same training basically the same training that a regular lecture since may does well the difference is that after the electrician %HESITATION finishes his course it's about six months he goes on to a ship any how does there are things that a normal attrition in the civilian world with fix lights fixed the laundry machine %HESITATION you know working voltage to see why the power is out %HESITATION for me even though I have that knowledge %HESITATION I didn't %HESITATION %HESITATION power school which is nuclear power school to learn a little more about what happens with the nuclear reactor so %HESITATION I deal with electricity things that happened down in the plant but I also have a lot more intimate so it's cool it's basically %HESITATION the theory that was behind it and they give you a little bit of practice 
What does EMC stand for?,yes he stands for lectures mate cheats really that's not cheap electricity is made but they put this Yummy and 
Are you an officer?,I'm not an officer basically the military is broken up into two formats there is the %HESITATION like then listed side then there's the officer's side to become an officer you need to have a college degree and you need commission to be an enlisted person basically if you graduated from high school then you're allowed to join in so an officer is %HESITATION a person who is in command of the unit an enlisted person is someone who does the work of of of the ship so officers managed it was that people did actions 
Are you an officer?,I'm not an officer on the cheek which is an E. seven for the paper it %HESITATION the military is broken up into two portions enlisted people who actually do the work and officers who %HESITATION basically manage now the enlisted people %HESITATION after certain pay grade Bob the six thirty seven you start to supervise those enlisted people officers from day one there automatically charge of the whole entire 
"You have a college degree, so why are you an officer?",I have a college degree and that allows me to apply to be an officer but not everybody to %HESITATION who has that degree wants to go that route Serbian officer you have to want to now and its people so do lots of paperwork sometimes to %HESITATION be in charge of the success or the failure of an entire unit and that carries a lot of responsibility %HESITATION I'm enlisted person and I do supervisor %HESITATION the people that are underneath me however %HESITATION if officers main goal is to become more and more important down the line so for instance if you're a captain or even a commander could have three hundred four hundred people underneath you and that's the main goal of most officers %HESITATION bringing less depressing you more technically this so even though you have %HESITATION a small unit %HESITATION that that drive to want to lead people is is slightly different 
What is the difference between an officer and an elisted person?,so the difference between an officer and enlisted member %HESITATION the kind of meld together %HESITATION what you get hired superiority but %HESITATION the real difference is when you start and he wanted or needed to %HESITATION CNN or airman basically their only goal there only a purpose in life is to do a technical job %HESITATION whereas an officer %HESITATION in in sin his his day one is actually managing a group of people hospitable training flight %HESITATION the the goal of what they're supposed to do is slightly different %HESITATION as you get higher as you get so becoming the five six or seven for enlisted or you become a lieutenant on that that's all three when officer you start going into management %HESITATION management and and supervising people so %HESITATION else on the ship you would see that they sevens the chiefs and ovaries the lieutenants are working side by side pretty much doing the same thing but in the lower ranks then %HESITATION was it is technical officers are managed 
How do you spend most of your time on deployment?,so deployment life can be pretty hard sometimes most of the time you're working I say about seventy five percent of most days you're either going to work or coming from work or %HESITATION you know sitting down preparing to go to work in a few hours %HESITATION but if there is time to relax so many people he joined dance they watch DVDs from home duh recreation center that we have there sit around and play cards %HESITATION did we kind of just sit and %HESITATION its leader on a night when you sleep though although like during the work do you do you know if at all so %HESITATION I remember my days would be I would wake up at about six fifty I would be in our in group in formation at seven it's only ten minutes I know but I was learn to be very very quick and then you working until four o'clock and so from that point on you could stand watch which would be another six hours after that at least for me on some people don't and what some people but half half I or you could %HESITATION be doing these out these trainings that %HESITATION come later on that night the called general quarters we were fighting a war so they pretend like a bomb hit a sore there's some kind of chemical spill or things that make you on that keep you on your feet to make sure that you you have all the skills that you need to fight the casualty so short answer you're working pretty much all day 
What did you do during your off time while deployed?,during your off time while you're deployed you have a couple things that you can do so I remember personally I would always go love thing I would always look at poker and %HESITATION still people's money evenly not supposed to but we've we've done we find some ways to you know have fun with each other %HESITATION eighty we would trade like coke bottles or trade a cigarette some people smoke I didn't but I still you know like in the the middle of trading things for for cards %HESITATION I also watch a lot of DVDs so we had an MWR morale recreation and welfare %HESITATION program where you how about the choice of maybe two hundred or three hundred DVDs %HESITATION Ellen has twenty one image to watch it on if you have your own personal DVD player or laptop %HESITATION but also %HESITATION just go out there on the fantail just watch the ships go by you know ships go by jets go by %HESITATION maybe for going along the coast just look at the beautiful country that never going he sighed 
How do you spend most of your time off deployment?,so when you're not deployed life is actually pretty good so the military comes in waves %HESITATION are hard time is moving on go on the plane that's when you give it your all that's when you're working the hardest but when you come back in the kinda go easy on you so %HESITATION well actually I was living in San Diego this is an example from when I was down there and our days were pretty early so that we fight there the rest are traffic on I think they began at six and then noon that's when %HESITATION we normally have a lunch %HESITATION but they they sent us home so it is a patchwork of six hours and so you just like god actually is %HESITATION five hours because %HESITATION the traffic is is the thing that that that's most of the morning so %HESITATION data from seven to the new dominion's let go home and does your family so you have a lot more time sometimes when you get off the plane 
Describe the work you do on a typical day (on/off deployment),the work that I tend to do on a typical day actually depends on whether I'm deployed or not deployed so on the planet %HESITATION then you pretty much written the whole day and it's broken up into chunks the first part of the day is %HESITATION just getting together %HESITATION talking about how the rest of the day it's going to be do work orders %HESITATION we write about the things that %HESITATION we should be doing for it next week for the next couple of hours or something like that so the next chunk is we actually go and perform the work are so that's about another three or four hours %HESITATION the next chunk is we get back and we started %HESITATION doing training so we make sure that we're ready for casualties that if there's a fire if %HESITATION there's a flood %HESITATION then that's about the time that you get off work and you have a couple of hours just to kinda relaxing on hang out but %HESITATION leader on a night when you do this thing called general quarters which means that you come back and the whole ship opportunists like there is %HESITATION a big houses do you happen to the entire ship so you're just going to connect when your %HESITATION not deployed and you're stationed on you know stateside Dan you days are like easier on you have one part of training what we wanna do later on you have another part of training where you just open up a book in review some electronics or or nuclear power things and then all you have a small part where you just doing preventive maintenance I mean which was that you were gonna pump make sure that's fine opening up regulators picking through you know the things inside and out putting new technology 
What are you doing now that you aren't active duty Navy?,now that I'm not %HESITATION into active duty navy I joined the US navy reserves and I've been there for about the last eight years so that doesn't extremely difficult didn't say that it's two days per month two weeks per year and I've also worked a lot more than that but %HESITATION it's a minimal time in the military so I've had a lot of time to do whatever I wanted to I split between working at jobs for instance my job is I'm a I'm a Japanese teacher in Japan but also work for the university of southern California institute greatest technologies and %HESITATION I find little pieces the jobs here and there so I'm a part of a start up %HESITATION pure science started working with Richard reality %HESITATION I also go to school so I'm a full time master's student %HESITATION when I'm back in America and I am studying game development 
How much do you earn working for the Navy?,so your paycheck is one of the biggest things that people are really really love about working for the military right now my keys so I make about forty five hundred dollars per month %HESITATION well I don't think I have some of the US navy reserve but usually on active duty she's make forty five hundred dollars per month and they also have this thing called the eight bits of allowance for housing which %HESITATION Halmos doubles your paycheck so you get about like twenty five hundred per month %HESITATION in if you have that up it's about seventy five thousand per year 
How many hours do you work in a typical day?,the amount of hours that you work in a typical day actually depend on whether you deployed or not so if you deploy fighting the war then I see twelve hours would probably be the average on some days you get away with working only eight that's including Saturdays %HESITATION many days attacked every four days you're working in for Dana house so you stand your eight hours of %HESITATION normal work and he had to general quarters which is actually training at night time for two or three or four hours around and then you could have another watch from midnight until six the next day and you could possibly have your normal work day tacked on the end of that so you know some days if I if you're really in it are you working you know but they'd have to to %HESITATION Sundays were my kids these days where I only work for six hours and that's like a great day for me would you not deployed umpteen days are a lot easier on you probably get to work around seven and then you leave around around noon so that means your days only files 
What types of problems do you deal with on a daily basis?,problems show up every now and then %HESITATION when you're on active duty so it kind of depends on whether you're deployed or not if you deploy that means %HESITATION things happen you know with any any mechanical equipment so up comes could break in the middle of the night and then you get breaking up and you know you have to go %HESITATION fix it %HESITATION sometimes you have people that come in drunk on the weekends and %HESITATION one report so you'd have to make sure that like to get to their bed safely and that they get and later on %HESITATION things like that happen on the planet or would you not deployed then %HESITATION you still hear the drunk people coming in you know but %HESITATION because you're not the ship isn't being used over and over and over every single day in and out %HESITATION problems with the with the equipment doesn't happen as much so you just be preventive maintenance which means that even though this pump looks fine just gonna open it up and check to make sure that the will is there inside like you 
What kind of issues are there with alcohol in the Navy?,so you probably heard of the term drunken sailors and that's very good reason I don't know what you're on what you deploy and you pull into a port which is like a %HESITATION little CEO of a new kind then the people are very fancy they wanna get out and you know party a little bit so he probably been on the ship in the middle of the ocean Gavin seen another you know non military so for about a month so they really want to go out there and you know like on you know do the opposite of what they were doing witches are being disciplined now they wanna you know Gokul be young kids %HESITATION the military's basically eighteen to twenty four year olds so %HESITATION kind like the college life so they go out there and do college level things they find the first bar %HESITATION the city to others you know fine you don't two does alcohol in defined in there the whole entire day and then they come back to the ship the military knows this so we have people walking around %HESITATION checking into the bars making sure there are car causing fights which they are make sure that people are %HESITATION you know drinking too much which they are %HESITATION make sure that our people can make it home safely %HESITATION you know which means that they come back by taxi which means that they come in handcuffs sometimes but I it's all in good fun by the time we leave you used at at five thousand people or sometimes eight thousand people that are there on you only have maybe one or two that actually get into real trouble I personally didn't I I personally was involved that drug culture so much I'd like to go out to the to the town in sport you know the museums and the scenery in and things like that but %HESITATION I I I I had a few things myself to 
What is the Navy doing to combat heavy alcohol use?,as soon as you join the military %HESITATION call your very first week even though you're Holland Europe lookout so you have no access to alcohol but from that time you know all the weapons until you in your career you gonna be hearing about alcohol alcohol responsibility the fact that you can't drink too much the fact that you know alcohol ruins people's lives and it's it a very big thing %HESITATION for a for a culture so then maybe take some strides to kind of things this %HESITATION we get lots of training we get um Francis when we go to ports more on the planet we have this thing called the buddy system which means that you're not allowed to go out yourself yes I have to tap one of your friends and the both of you out so explore this new city they wanna make sure that you don't go out there and %HESITATION get yourself in trouble by drinking too much alcohol and then having a stranger you know got back to the ship they're people who would rather use their people who will you know do harm to you so the buddy system is problem the navy's biggest way to combat alcohol misuse 
How much did your friends impact where you ended up in your career?,so from that day that you join the navy you're going to find that you have similar past %HESITATION people %HESITATION better in your same field so you know are there people who were very motivated and want to become %HESITATION the master chief of the navy yeah some people who %HESITATION meager criminals before and join the military it's %HESITATION %HESITATION proving going to jail to be %HESITATION to be given a shot for normal life before the the one it up in a in a bad place so you have to hold them in of people %HESITATION and different creep past different televisions different on the motivations for being a military so in general people of a similar quality tend to hang out with us city people so people like to drink all the time you'll find that they're you know how this one house that we always go to over and over %HESITATION people that are very motivated %HESITATION study all the time you'll find that they've probably share a house with people who want to become an officer so you also find that %HESITATION that's very apparent with in the ports that you go to so for me I didn't want %HESITATION I wasn't a drinker at the time not not very much so I'm going to court and I try to tell people like Kate home you want to go see someplace fun you want to claim the number is it a castle so %HESITATION once we do that in this very limited chance of that we find problems %HESITATION some of the people who like a really you know really eager to have fun on the very first place that they go to the bar and %HESITATION people some of them are there and you get lots of people like that then %HESITATION probably if you find something to trouble so as long as you're aware of that on his long as you're not somebody that %HESITATION treats all the time and you don't want to get me in trouble was just fine trying to like visit ports and once I'm even though I don't wanna drink all the time I have to realize that if I visit people that are drinking all the time and I might get in trouble as well like as long as you can kind of you're where hear specifics here then on you have a much better time the military 
What is A-school?,the school is %HESITATION basic training that most military people join when they are when we start working for the navy so I'm lectures is made that means I would say in a school it's cool is it's only a lot my colleagues to give you the fundamentals of your job %HESITATION I learned %HESITATION electrical theory electronics theory %HESITATION things about voltage and current %HESITATION Howell health physics applies to the pump and a thousand given that we're using so %HESITATION in college it's very very sporadic you know my work for maybe two hours of three hours on Monday two hours in the morning you know three hours a night but for the military it's very very %HESITATION intense so they give you about a year or two years of training a short period of time it hours everyday Monday 
What are the major benefits of doing this kind of work?,so when you do this type of work you get a lot of benefits when I joined I I think I was working at McDonalds and %HESITATION the swap meet maybe the movie theater to I think I was working two or three jobs and you know all around here and %HESITATION I don't have any type of your action %HESITATION I know smart but I just didn't have enough time to you know pay my bills at the time so I joined the military and one in there %HESITATION fair promises were they said that you could have a really high paying job at the end of your career you know it's a six year contract so I said okay we'll have the skills of the three times now becoming physics don't thermodynamics chemistry bomb ends by the end of my six year tour I am I had enough knowledge to basically become Homer Simpson I could go out there and work a nuclear power plant fully full full of confidence so they give the skills that you need to get a really high paying job or a different job you know depends on which one did 
What do most people do after leaving active duty?,so at the end of their activity active duty tour you have a lot of options in front of you %HESITATION number one you can try to go back into the military if you like the career if you %HESITATION wanted to stay in the same field then you could so for instance the aircraft mechanics %HESITATION yes they were they were fixing Jackson they were working on jets so there aren't that many just that they could work on outside but Boeing is eager to hire those people %HESITATION you can see how jets and seven forty sevens kind of are the same thing so you can find something in your field %HESITATION for me personally I didn't actually like my field of please leave enough to make a full career out of it so I changed instead of electricians mate IE I became a computer scientist which is something completely different %HESITATION but I all the basic skills that I received the math and the physics the thinking logically about things they they still applied so my my computer science 
What are the major negatives of doing this kind of work?,so for all the benefits that the military job provides you can also have a lot of frustration with the job %HESITATION this for most people I think this might be the hardest that you'll ever work in your life %HESITATION that's how come %HESITATION %HESITATION the military has young people do it and then what they leave the vehicle that wants a productive careers but they always say you know what this is I can do anything because I work so hard for the military %HESITATION along with that long those long working hours you away from your family and that's a part of have long working hours so for instance the plane is probably everyone's major reason for getting out they want to see their kids grow up they want %HESITATION spend more time with their wife they one actually the parents have have a social life so these are things that you have to give up by joining the military 
Was it worth it?,for me personally them joining the military was one of the best things I could die you will work really hard and %HESITATION what you get out and you become a civilian you realize that what you did what is protect the nation you protected by the people around you the civilians and Tennessee even a job that you'll start to have in the job that they've always had you had a large part in making that possible so I think was worth it for the private to get for doing for serving your country and the skills that you that you obtain %HESITATION because I I didn't have any other skills before but from that point on had my education paid for and I had a valuable job that if everyone it's like at that point ending have love have a really high paying job so it was definitely worth it 
What are the main things that new employees must learn and adjust to?,really hard and %HESITATION what you get out and you become a civilian you realize that what you did what is protect the nation you protected by the people around you the civilians and Tennessee even a job that you'll start to have in the job that they've always had you had a large part in making that possible so I think was worth it for the private to get for doing for serving your country and the skills that you that you obtain %HESITATION because I I didn't have any other skills before but from that point on had my education paid for and I had a valuable job that if everyone it's like at that point ending have love have a really high paying job so it was definitely worth it what questions going what are the main things that employees must learn and adjust to the main thing that a new navy person has to learn is that you have to you have to be able to follow directions if you can do that then %HESITATION then you'll you'll be fine if you ever seen the movie Forrest Gump this is the person who had an incredible military affairs and the only thing they did was just follow the dress that people get in and out that's basically the truth %HESITATION won't get in trouble if you follow the directions that people give you your own you do your job well just by following the procedures that are part of you and in fact the main reason that people get in trouble is because they deviate from the chief tells them Hagel going to the built in spell it out and then he doesn't feel like it so he gets in trouble %HESITATION that she tells them Hey you know what I'm meet this procedure ABC in the don't deviate and keep things that he wants to do it really fast or I really quicker or you know so can you doesn't it never works out so as long as you follow directions 
How much travel did you do during active duty?,I didn't travel that much weight I lose %HESITATION in active duty I think we have like maybe one month per year on that we're allowed to take but I didn't I didn't really talk to my family that leads to I didn't have friends in far away places so I can imported my my leave days however what I saw in most cases is that %HESITATION during the Christmas season and during the summer people take two weeks and are in the middle of the year two weeks at the end of the year to go all across the country to go back and visit the family so liberty vacation is something that the navy is very generous about 
How much travel did you do during active duty?,one month per year so that's a lot of travel %HESITATION that I'm allowed to do but I didn't do too much of it coming just stayed at home with this thing called the military bubble where you can just hang out with the people in your same unit %HESITATION don't really get out that lights it and it's fun for awhile on you have a lot of money so you can do lots of things you can on take these things called mac flights where you can if you're on leave can travel across country for basically free on but I think I was just waiting to become a civilians actually %HESITATION really enjoy myself so I just poured all my all my travel days till the very end 
What countries did you visit on Port Calls?,so we're going to play me you can have these things called apart cause which is where you go to the country go to their major city and then you can like at the time of your life so places that I've been to that really %HESITATION I really enjoyed where on Hong Kong Malaysia Singapore %HESITATION I went to Australia three times I went to Bahrain Dubai %HESITATION also went to Japan %HESITATION that's round trip from the work right now so I want to about ten or fifteen countries 
How much travel do you do now that you're out of the Navy?,since I became a civilian I think I travel a lot more than I did in the navy with the navy yeah actually %HESITATION get stationed all over the country %HESITATION now and civilian I would stay in the %HESITATION in California that's my hometown but I have the opportunity and adopting you travel a lot more so I take flights to %HESITATION York just if I feel like it %HESITATION I take %HESITATION drives to Las Vegas on because coming closer to Los Angeles and %HESITATION I also still to travel a lot because of the US navy reserve so and then get the reserve the sea to the four corners of America we go to New Hampshire %HESITATION Virginia also to Washington in San Diego so I'm pretty much every year that's inside me there leave your free a free car and a free hotel so it's kind of like a little mini travel work isn't that difficult so I use that as a waiter to get out I was also stationed in Hawaii last last year and it was really fun 
What lifestyle changes does being in the Navy involve?,so some of the lifestyle changes that you can expect number one you where did you get used to wearing a uniform unity in putting this thing on every single day I we have a couple of different %HESITATION styles to choose from problem we can throw coveralls a friendship %HESITATION these the we can use that where you're walking around a normal city %HESITATION but we also have like a dress whites in dress blues Conde look really nice another lifestyle change you can expect is thought to be following orders so if you're working at McDonalds in you have a boss telling you know go to drive thru go duh %HESITATION some practices in the morning so same thing that that's not going to change just because you're the military in fact is going to get a little bit more out more intense you can stay so you have to you know five six boxes %HESITATION they have a hierarchy and when I hear from one less than the other but you're gonna be hearing you know what to do every single day 
Did you like wearing the same uniform?,so this uniform that we have is first of all I like the colors makes you look really really military can say say that there's this person onstage seem jobs used to wear the same exact thing every single day and he was very successful %HESITATION has a has a computer manager %HESITATION and he said that he wore the same exact thing because he didn't have to think about what to wear every single day so you didn't have that impression here you know like you know what's going to wear so there's like very very little thought process of what what is going on was going to be just it is gonna be the same thing or yesterday or is it gonna be this new press one but it's going to be cameras today 
Who are the most important people in the Navy?,it is the message you of an eighty there's the secretary defense obviously the president vice president knows that the hierarchy in obviously if you're an active duty then you have your commanding officer you have your excel and those of the like on if the president and vice president of your little commands %HESITATION like specifically within your rec center %HESITATION the chief is the guy a TV series even acetate those of the people that are in charge of all the illicit people and it there your whole world that's your mom your dad 
How much do you understand the overall goals of what you are doing?,so acted made many people who are actively working for the navy don't really know how they fit into the big picture and that's by design %HESITATION it's very specialized so for instance as in he wanted you to eat three %HESITATION your whole entire world is to do this technical job to fix a problem so to paint this wall and %HESITATION you might not see it but making sure that part is fixed or making sure that wall is painted make sure that the ship to run because for the ship to run make sure that the officer can fly jets because for that that Jack is fixed and that piling those information we should make you can drop this bomb making sure that bomb drops make sure that the battle is won because of the battles one make sure the wars one so when you pinning that wall you don't really see how that is actually helping you win the war in Afghanistan but it does so the higher you get in your illicit %HESITATION pay grade the more you see that big picture how many seven so my responsibility is to know how this unit can help the civilians %HESITATION make sure that %HESITATION this aircraft here runs fine and I think as officers of the higher you get no if your captain you make sure that this aircraft carrier it's in this %HESITATION realm of the reason so that like we have a power over there we can dominate our foes so it depends on on your pay grade 
How much of your private time is spent doing your job?,so with the military your job is your life you're in the military for twenty four hours even on the weekends so as long as you you know encompass this fact you know make that a part of your being in on you understand why it is that on at night time you might still be working on some kind of project so for instance if you're on maybe one three six you have a normal work day and then %HESITATION you might be called back in some sometimes it's %HESITATION make sure that a night event can go on as required and on nobody ever has a problem with that but usually it on for the floor you one three six %HESITATION they have a full time job %HESITATION when when the plane in which it means that were out there fighting the war then they're called all the time %HESITATION when you're back home and you have your family life and on he expected to go home every single night then it's to give you a little bit tricky trying to balance both of them %HESITATION your civilian life is it can be really tough 
"Off of active duty, do you still take work home with you?",now that I'm not in the active duty I find that I'm still working pretty often %HESITATION even though I'm not on the clock per se %HESITATION I still have to bring my work home with me sometimes so for instance in the US navy reserve he's also worked to two days per month %HESITATION outside to two days per month and two weeks per year but I find that I'm working sometimes Mondays sometimes Wednesdays sometimes %HESITATION Monday Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday %HESITATION doing evaluations %HESITATION making sure that we we have some kind of lesson was forced to go to making sure that people have they're cracked up the training so %HESITATION it's not a nine to five job %HESITATION normally %HESITATION when I was active duty and I was on a plane and I was station %HESITATION at my command %HESITATION you still work many many cases %HESITATION during that time so as long as you just make sure that you understand that that could happen if you will wife or your husband understand that situation then %HESITATION realize that %HESITATION workers working is what you have to do 
How much turnover is there in the Navy?,after you do your activity tour and it really depends on what type of job you have to to dictate what you wanna do afterwards so if you really love your job then you probably make it %HESITATION thirty year career if if if that's possible %HESITATION I know a lot of people who were like spies you know the crypto tax %HESITATION that people in %HESITATION human relations public relations officers they act absolutely love their job they can think of doing anything else %HESITATION some of the people with heart of jobs for instance of the nuclear field maybe some of that band sounds like the E. T.'s soda right control men %HESITATION they might be expected to a little bit more work and they can be a little bit more demanding %HESITATION sometimes a bit more frustrating that do more see tour is so %HESITATION you get to a place where you want to actually live the civilian life that you see also make many other people are are experiencing so %HESITATION by the time you're six years is up with for years it is that is up that's a pretty pretty pretty big milestone for you to make %HESITATION for your career and the turnover can be pretty sharp upon my guess is that twenty percent of people actually stand whether other eighty percent they actually go out and use their education benefits and %HESITATION live %HESITATION higher paying jobs %HESITATION doing something that's like your work 
How stable is employment in the Navy?,so job security is one of the military's major major positives %HESITATION you're not gonna get fired unless you really do something bad and even if you do something that is on this night you know like a short of murder then you still gonna be there you still gonna a %HESITATION you might be reduced of the record to %HESITATION quite sometimes I've even seen three %HESITATION but they will keep you and and %HESITATION as long as you have motivation to get yourself back in you will always have a job 
What opportunities do you have to alter your own work schedule?,so it depends on what your rank is but the people that are above you they're the ones who kind of tell you what it is is possibly doing so %HESITATION if you're one of the lower pay grades then in the morning coming to sit around and wait for them to pass out the work to everyone but people come in and say okay Janklow's today you're on the house today you're on sixteen the drains today you're in the bill today %HESITATION chiefs are the ones who actually tell people what to do so %HESITATION they don't need to be told about what it is this was to be doing because they only have one job which is to hand out the work on another hand officers %HESITATION it has basically the same pair of the same the same directional flow so for instance and %HESITATION one or two or three %HESITATION they're told by the higher level people who this most menacing disposable tag along with these people for I think for officers them main goal is just to be up to train themselves so they hang out in the room where they can hang out down and %HESITATION dental plans to study so on process have a lot more opportunity to self study illicit people they will know exactly what they're doing for the first two or three years of their career 
How many Navy members have high stress symptoms?,so for the eight years that I've been in the in the US navy active duty service I've seen everyone how high stress symptoms so I I I myself included that several times so %HESITATION these these working hours can be really really long and there's been many times when I just want to say Hey you know I just wanna go to my bed and relax and sleep and not have anyone tell me what to do %HESITATION but the difference between %HESITATION a military person and a civilian is that it's ingrained in us to take orders so regardless of how I feel at the end of the day I'm gonna do my work a maybe civilian person with quit their job Leedy sillin person would I yell at their boss %HESITATION play our military people they don't do that that's our culture so %HESITATION you live with it deliver the stress that comes 
What happens if I don't like this line of work?,so if you're in the navy and you find out that you don't like the job that you're doing the best thing I can say is at least for a short amount of time you have to suck it up %HESITATION I know some people who get one of the machinists mates but they were given an awesome though like three or four jobs they chose something else in there they were given that that was his main job anyways %HESITATION so at the end of four years on and you have to have to do your four years on the live that life need learn those things did that training to get that job and at the end then they left and did a did something else for the civilians %HESITATION you can't really change your job after after you have you decided to do it so mean I've been lectures and made this whole entire time there's a very there are very few opportunities that affect each I could be in that and officer and then my my life I would change or I could of %HESITATION chosen my commands %HESITATION later on in my career that would change my lifestyle but it wouldn't actually team %HESITATION my job itself so I guess one big suggestion is make sure that the job that you're getting yourself involved in something that you think you could you can really do and have fun 
What opportunities do you have to change career field?,you can change grip feels after awhile %HESITATION either in the military %HESITATION because you've been doing your job for awhile and you can choose your next command that you go to or you can try to %HESITATION do a job that just requires your pay grade but doesn't require specific job %HESITATION like Francis lectures is made how many seven so I can do any seven job petite job that doesn't require lectures and made itself but those are few and far between so what you do %HESITATION get out of the military on if that's what they choose to make then I think that %HESITATION skills that they provided for instance math and science and %HESITATION taking orders those can be applied anywhere so as long as I'm in a technical field I think %HESITATION hasn't as much as maybe I can do anything from work on aircraft carriers too working %HESITATION in that academic field on right now I'm a computer science major and I'm still using some of the lectures many things that I learned solo your opportunities to expand your career greatly live after you get out of military 
What experiences do you have with nukes?,when I joined I had a couple of opportunities in front of me %HESITATION I think I heard her reason why to be out of shift the tax bite out the nuclear field blows very very exciting %HESITATION they said that I had a good opportunity to go to the Naval Academy he said that %HESITATION I learned %HESITATION physics and chemistry thermodynamics and a nuclear power you know very very well %HESITATION they said that it's an advanced field and %HESITATION people out there in the civilian world know it so they gave all these positives Sir join the nuclear field and I I got it you know it was it is a that I so overshadowed any other job that I wanted to that I want to pursue in a school you learn basically graduate level nuclear work so nuclear studies so %HESITATION I've been in college and I went to a unit masses courses and I gotta admit on the military is actually more intense then colleagues think any because it had been to %HESITATION they the working for eight hours per day they give you lots of tests and it's that simple they always say that nuclear field is his heart is a pre calc or IP algebra class nine and that's actually true %HESITATION everything is written down for you in easy to read explanations and so if you could we need normally as as a as a high school student princess if you if you god isn't easy maybe mid season in high school in this learning is is no problem for you the difference is you have to be willing to do it for a long time and if you start lacking then you need to start doing all all the homework that they tell you to do they're not gonna let you fell on the difference is everybody that goes to this training by the ins for the nuclear deal that at least %HESITATION they know exactly what what you're going to do on how to how to do of the nuclear training that that that they've been so and if you can't then you have to do something else so there is no opportunity for value 
"So, did you work with nukes?",when I joined and they told me I was going to be in the nuclear field after us admit %HESITATION until I started going to the school itself I did not know what a new Gladys so did I work with nukes dancers no nukes %HESITATION mean on nuclear weapons and %HESITATION if you work for submarine for ballistic %HESITATION submarine then you do see the nukes but you're not the one who is working on %HESITATION what the nuclear field means is that we work for %HESITATION engineering portion of the nuclear powered aircraft carriers so with the engine of the ship if you think of a car as of as they are kept here in where the things that make it you know go boom with the first where the thing that Mexico for developed through the through the through the road I guess and with the with people and make our electricity happen for the entire settlement over the people that %HESITATION make the CD player on %HESITATION Italy where where the life blood of the aircraft carrier 
What does your startup do?,I had a good opportunity to meet %HESITATION really smart %HESITATION Chinese person when I was working as %HESITATION %HESITATION when I was education abroad here in Japan so %HESITATION I finish and I went to USC to start my masters and he finished and he went back to China to start is start up %HESITATION I have to ask a few questions for the games I was making at USC and he was asking how the design of a virtual reality program that he's making %HESITATION from me and we found out that we work really well together you know we both look out here free smart %HESITATION we both not like %HESITATION we work well together we make each other laugh so %HESITATION he said Hey why don't you join my start ups I was there as a founding member and the games that we're making we made many impacts %HESITATION one is that we used to connect it %HESITATION the combined with a leap motion controller and you can move around the the %HESITATION player in this kind of virtual reality world on fighting dragons another game that I made was made with %HESITATION the pipe controller and we shoot zombies %HESITATION the current game that we're making is suppose to be really really popular %HESITATION it's basically a cross between Super Mario and legend of Zelda where you are just walk in this world going up and up trying to fight this out because most of the time it's really cool and it's a it's a it's a lot of fun 
What is Japan like?,Japan what can I say about Japan so we went to many places when we're on the planet Australia Hong Kong Singapore you know tons and first place that we went in Japan was sensible which is at the very very bottom of Japan so I was so eager to go to Tokyo you know you hear about Tokyo all the time so I said no you can't go and %HESITATION that that that broke my heart but even those at the very bottom of Japan it's kind like the countryside just walking around you know blew me away %HESITATION to people were outstandingly nice the food was incredibly delicious that electronics blue anything that America that I've ever seen in America how the water %HESITATION I guess you have testified in America where it's like a whole huge floor electronics well if you go to Japan and be prepared to go up eight or ten floors of Best Buy over and over and over and %HESITATION in be prepared to be amazed 
Do you speak any other languages?,when I started to go to school I wanted to %HESITATION be able to speak five languages by the time I was twenty seven I was twenty one at a time so that's why I want to join the military to go to their world famous language schools and learn speak French which I know a little bit of German which had a little bit of I'm Spanish which I knew a little bit of in my English since then I've also learned Japanese so I %HESITATION the reason I'm in Japan right now so that I can actually learn the latest fully because I didn't know that means that many languages until now so I decided Hey come here live for a long time and learn it you know intensively for your 
Describe a particular technical issue you've had to solve on the job.,when you're in the military you're given a lot of technical training well we're fortunate that we don't really have to apply their technical training when you're working you habits this list of things explicit do you do it get this list the procedure that is was Apollo and you call them and when you don't know something %HESITATION that's wrong with somebody working on like a pump or about %HESITATION the voltage regulator %HESITATION there's already a list %HESITATION well that a list of the the proceeds that useful to follow so I didn't I deal with technical problems so much in that regard however %HESITATION that doesn't mean that we don't figure out technical things all the time so especially during your a school in your car school you presented with you know college level problems all the time so for instance I hear is an electrical schematic %HESITATION and you're not getting the full text at this at this %HESITATION point so how is that possible or on this is a picture of a pop and for some reason that this water coming from this part please troubleshoot how you would figure out where this water is is his faulting and so %HESITATION after a school you presented with those types of problems pretty often throughout the time that you're that you're in in the navy you don't see them so often %HESITATION when you do see it it's a really big problem because like we do select committee made in some so much work that you definitely sissy but %HESITATION we do have a problem it's a big group after it and it's really hard to like I say that one person actually but %HESITATION you presented with the though small a theoretical problems all the time 
How much of your time is spent with people versus with technology?,most of my time is spent with people regardless of where you go there's very few times that you're going to sit by yourself just being alone %HESITATION just like I'm port they always have you have a buddy along to a to make sure that you don't get in trouble when you're working they actually have a buddy that goes with you to make sure that you follow procedures the right way so beat you I was working with between two five people and %HESITATION for normal preventive maintenance that you do %HESITATION and for each of those things the only thing that we do is we work with machines so you're always with people and so on high high tech equipment all the time
