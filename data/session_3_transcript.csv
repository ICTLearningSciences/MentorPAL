What is the most challening part about your job? ,the most proud that most challenging part of my job is probably being able to %HESITATION manage everything that's given to you %HESITATION without really fussing about it on something you agree with some things you won't agree with %HESITATION and you have to make sure that the part that you agree with you you know said very very clearly to your people are the parts that you don't agree with sometimes you have to act like tell your boss here you know I need it's better this way and whatever else he gives whether he you know you can convince some or where their %HESITATION you have the materials that it takes to convince him otherwise if you have to make a strong and it would ever get your convictions are and %HESITATION prison is your people so it's very good Sir %HESITATION take all of your input everything that everybody's trying to tell you and I make sure that you understand it correctly and that you can present it quickly that's probably the most challenging part of my job 
What is the biggest barrier to entry in this field? ,big experience entry %HESITATION to join the navy and basically the military in general is that you have to be able to follow directions and even though that sounds like a very small task it's %HESITATION it shows up everywhere in everything that you do from %HESITATION from doing simplicity **** to writing your name to %HESITATION you know making a list of things to do in the complex procedure you know and everything that's in between those two goes to %HESITATION there's two distinct elements so %HESITATION of course the people who are really bright they get the more complex jobs you know that he's really good about that but %HESITATION no matter what you what your job is you're going to find yourself are faced with a complex situation and %HESITATION is very poor and to %HESITATION follow directions %HESITATION because %HESITATION people's lives are at stake you can actually get someone killed with some of the things that you do I'm even if you're a painter or %HESITATION both drivers or an electrician no matter what you do %HESITATION it's gonna affect somebody some way and you do not really familiar with exactly how it's going to affect people so you have to really %HESITATION do the job that people tell you to do %HESITATION because you can see all the dangers that associated with it 
How did you become interested in this type of work?,first became interested in joining the military %HESITATION back in the day when my father used a %HESITATION come back %HESITATION from his work in is in his uniform from the army and he'd tell me about all the things that he had experienced %HESITATION I grew up in a in the fifth sixth and seventh grade and part of it great and in Germany and although I didn't really see the military part of it I did see some of the things that like are you could have outside of the work so I saw that a nice house that you can live in it I saw the cool car he was driving I saw %HESITATION %HESITATION many times you know people no P. team exercising outside key to trading so %HESITATION I got the impression of like what the military lifestyle would be would be like compared to all the civilian life lifestyles that I saw on background from and I gotta say I use really impressive 
How did you first become interested in computer science?,I first became interested in computer science when I was in community colleges I did eight years in the in the navy as an active duty electricians mate and I learned a lot about engineering and I thought I was going to go to college to do electrical engineering however %HESITATION some of the class that you learn with lex continuing our computer science and so I went to a room research %HESITATION internship earlier wasn't interested uses research for UC Berkeley and so I thought was an intellectual hearing but they had so many cool computer science topics and %HESITATION professors and of little things around campus that really really the power meter kind of consider computer science as a career so when I went back home when I would %HESITATION when it was done with their research and I went back home I am really focused on my computer science classes and %HESITATION I just realized Hey you know ahead of all classes that I am learning math %HESITATION science English the computer science classes were some of the most fun and I just thought you know if I want to make my own business %HESITATION if I was going like engineering I have to go to radio shack and have to buy resistors I'd have to spend lots of money after like us in lots of time blood out with computer science you have your own business right in front of you if you just open up your laptop you have a million dollar idea just open your laptop I'm typing on some he is so that's all 
Why did you choose this career?,for me particularly I I chose the navy as a career because it seemed like a very easy Adams and straight forward step to begin a career so at the time I was just graduated from high school I was working at McDonalds and you'll bear side job swap meet a movie theater is to sell knives are used to sell home alarm systems those bouncing all over the place and %HESITATION I kept coming back to the thinking you know it %HESITATION the military is a good way to start I knew about their their money for education I knew about %HESITATION after you do your tour you could have a really good %HESITATION potential career outside of the military you know so these things are in the back of my mind unfortunately I am I tried to join in in high school and my eyesight is really bad so they had %HESITATION %HESITATION disqualified me from joining so I spent two years outside of high school trying to %HESITATION you know make my way through twenty college anyway through fear side jobs and %HESITATION it just wasn't for me so like the military is a good step to %HESITATION I tried again and I was accepted so that was really gets up to start now it fair 
"If you could do it all over, would you choose this career again? ",if I have to we joined the navy and %HESITATION considering the different options that I could have I think I think that that intellect fission really opened up some doors for me it actually like I long to think about %HESITATION differ things that I that I would have otherwise I know about I know about nuclear technology and all about %HESITATION electricity things voltage current %HESITATION resistors and about Howard what's I know lots of %HESITATION lots of things that had never even considered myself interested in before so does that help me in a sense I think it does it gives me a better perspective what I'd do it over again so the thing that I'm lacking from %HESITATION from doing my nuclear technology Pat is I don't have a long history with computer science so I think if I would have joined like for instance the IT field the information technology field then and after eight years I'd be really really bright about computer science and networks and %HESITATION looks going on in the on the interior of a computer %HESITATION however the problem would be that I wouldn't know %HESITATION electrical portion of it so I think I'm happy with my decision but I would probably try to do %HESITATION something more computer science oriented if I if I had to do it again knowing that we do in the future 
"When you were a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up?",when I was a kid I think I was more interested in like the humanities side of life so I tried to do a little bit of piano when I was a kid %HESITATION you my brother would go to kennel lessons and I you know I was a part of a a black gospel choir %HESITATION so I would always look at the guys are sitting there you know dabbling on the council really fast and I thought you know what I can make songs like that I I had not used I listen to rock and pop you know prince Michael Jackson's like god you know it I don't listen to the songs and give me this feeling in my heart so maybe I'm a musician %HESITATION as it turned out my brother didn't want to go to a piano lessons anymore so my grandmother did want to just take me by myself you know so he tell us that our lessons and that was the end of that a musical career %HESITATION my mother was an artist so I always like the sketch on patent stuff I would be the dryness like animated characters X. men and spider man and I was getting up there and %HESITATION in my ability but how it out they also felt out so yeah when I was young I actually wanted to you like a you know like the god non engineering announced on things but I I has a way of like drawing you in a different direction 
What sports did you play in high school? ,so even though I was in %HESITATION really a jock in high school I actually had a lot of a lot of interesting activities so I ran track and field %HESITATION and I was a I was %HESITATION varsity material %HESITATION virtually I sprained my ankle %HESITATION during my junior year so that that ended my %HESITATION might cause aspirations but I also ran across country you know cross country first no running three miles %HESITATION for our needs and then %HESITATION track and field American is something in the spring so what were you run fast %HESITATION also tried my hand at other other things like god I guess wrestling for a day or two of basketball I tried on and I had it I didn't get it accepted but on also it was involved in things like sad on students against drunk driving %HESITATION Amnesty International %HESITATION enter a cornucopia of other things 
What is your favorite color?,my favorite color has to be black it just looks good on everything 
Are you married?,right now pretty single here in Japan %HESITATION still looking 
Do you have siblings?,first it would go I have in older brother and an older sister my brother is one year older than me and he joined the army about before %HESITATION I did my navy thing and I have a sister who's ten years older than me as he lives in Michigan with profound 
Do you have any pets?,my whole life I wanted a dog you know everywhere I go I cannot have a pet %HESITATION especially here in Japan you know you could not outs have pets he's really small apartments but as soon as I can so they have my you know speak for a job when you get you know a nice %HESITATION what is it spits or maybe it's a cop Cali if they're out there may be a we call those things I don't know if they're really pushy and nice and you know playful I keep I keep it on 
What is your favorite food?,I have two favorite foods %HESITATION when I am in the United States my favorite food is %HESITATION ice cream how did us all the way but when I'm injured increments a pen %HESITATION it switches over to robin because they make delicious rami here %HESITATION this new compared to you in the U. S. 
What is your least favorite food?,my least favorite food has to be any type of seafood which I really sex because I'm in Japan and it's all over the place so I was like I'm missing out by %HESITATION yeah I know does the food I like cod %HESITATION but those shrimp lobster and nothing with eyeballs looking at me when I'm looking at it home I'm not too hot on vegetables either but you know you got you got a you know as long as there's some meat I can click need a mop in the veggies I'm in favor of those people at all 
What is the food like in the military?,for in the military it's I guess it's outstanding of maybe not many people would agree with that because it's kind of plane in black %HESITATION so you have your your cafeteria style you know starts to leave you go there I want to meet I want some potatoes I want some broccoli you know and downplayed the it provides a good selection for you %HESITATION they don't really season it so much because %HESITATION so we could come through you know it's not like it it's Applebee's anything they allow you season it yourself so as long as you kind of realize that you know then they give you big portions for a little cost or no cost if you're active duty and %HESITATION and technically it is helping you know %HESITATION effect I think that the recently to salt away from the table so like god you have to wake up trying to be healthy we need your food and it delivers 
Do you shoot guns?,when I first joined the military I thought okay and let me exercised all day and then shooting guns all night but fortunately %HESITATION neither does really came to pass you have some time to exercise but as far as shooting guns it's not really something that's really popular here %HESITATION especially when you're out on the plane in which is six months on the middle of the ocean %HESITATION some people that the military police the MPs they have guns %HESITATION but it's not like out there practicing all the time you know like it's a the practice package store and at when you're unsure %HESITATION busily do my job as electricians me it's not like I can practice but there are opportunities to practice their shooting ranges that people go to and I want my ratings 
Can you explain the ribbon system?,the military has a really good system for %HESITATION acknowledging the conflicts that accomplishment that people do so if you go out in the middle of the ocean and you come back in that's a tour in value you get a little ribbon right here and you can see on this uniform but on other uniforms to wear your dress blues he just whites %HESITATION other like nice uniforms at you where you can have like little emblems %HESITATION they go three by three by three and %HESITATION get them for various there's things if you shoot a gun really well the you can get an expert witness %HESITATION if you how do something really really productive for the ship that you run you can get like %HESITATION %HESITATION I need the achievement that say or if you %HESITATION go to a specific place in the middle in in the world idea by certain ward he can get another it so %HESITATION as you go along with it you're in you start acquiring these weapons any kind of scene who's been our number one in the longest time and number two who's had the most success in a job by the moderate is that the you can really see lots of adults with like a really big huge stacks of 
What are the ribbons/awards that you've gotten?,some of the ribbons that I've received %HESITATION include %HESITATION historian and %HESITATION rifle ribbon both experts I received that a sea service deployment ribbon which means that I %HESITATION when on the ship some people maybe don't do that so %HESITATION the ones who do they get that I also received a %HESITATION exhibition expeditionary expeditionary given for my ship %HESITATION because we did a really good job out there we're doing training and I was a big part of that %HESITATION in in one of the few other ones until like one about thirteen more 
Do you have any tattoos?,it uses a really common thing in the military I personally don't have any but you can see every everything from a little hard on the shoulder to you know a big you know flag on the back of people so I think it was just never for me 
Do you get to swim in the ocean?,we definitely don't get to swim in the middle of the ocean %HESITATION so we did actually did get to swim notion but it's not very common %HESITATION when he was like a really high weed out been out to sea for like a month two months is the way that people were getting antsy so we had to swim call so what happened was our aircraft carrier was %HESITATION it came to a full stop and we had navy seals in out in boats around the water %HESITATION with guns tissue charts and %HESITATION we could jump from the from the elevator that aircraft elevator which is really far far up the it's about like %HESITATION fibers six second drop which you drugged up over there scum like a diving board so you jump over the edge you go down beautiful backwater in keep going when it gets really cold may come back up and it's warm again invaluable to swim to the back of the ship %HESITATION so it's about another %HESITATION eighty minute more to go to the back and you have to get out so it's not like you can like thing out there is limited and you know I or frisbee around it you know like play volleyball anything it's like as you jump across %HESITATION good out of the water and you come out of these into the back you can do that many times you know but I I did it once with this I think it actually twice user is gonna find I can barely stand that's good enough for me 
Do you have to be a good swimmer to join the Navy?,you don't have to be the best swimmer to join the military %HESITATION that's a common question this like lead you in the military chance when I was like yeah so I I learned to swim out while it's in the navy but when I first started I could barely doggy paddle so %HESITATION the requirements for boot camp are if you have to jump into %HESITATION some some water and you can't hold on to anything get to be hello for two minutes and then you come back up so if you don't know how to do that then there are some there's a little bit of practice that you can do it and so basically everybody passes %HESITATION if you defecate passcode been they have like specific but most of the time that's not a problem to pass to just do two minutes 
What is deployment?,the planet is way it's called when %HESITATION a navy vessel goes to an extended playmate so fight a war do some training so my ship USS John C. Stennis we actually went on from our home port in San Diego and went to the Middle the middle of the mid the Mideast and %HESITATION swim in the ocean there we did so we rode on the phone right but %HESITATION run the raven golf around the surrounding islands %HESITATION maybe %HESITATION route Singapore in just in that general area are what the war is going on and %HESITATION we stayed there for six months %HESITATION enemy come back home to San Diego so what your home %HESITATION to your to your home for %HESITATION then you do well on the ship sometimes but you don't go out for that long you don't go out that far but the plan is that's when %HESITATION your family comes you know you say goodbye to your significant other you know have the kids on the on the shoulder and say you know you get to your dad or your mom pack your bags up in it's a big farewell ceremony you know and they know everybody their weekly to come back six or seven or eight months later 
What's something that most people don't know about computer science? ,something that a lot of people don't really realize about computer science is just how easy it it is %HESITATION yes it can be very difficult of yet sometimes figure out how the rhythms yet to figure out the best way to put the the light that comes from a screen %HESITATION based on %HESITATION the moving of the characters and you have to like %HESITATION you you have to understand that the puter is like tackling thousands of things per second you know actually millions of things per second so you have to like %HESITATION we can optimize %HESITATION the things that are that you tell the computer to do to make it so all that's very very difficult however some of computer science is really really easy I know that some people are who had done computers at all on can you know study for a week or two and then put things on the computer like web design or something so %HESITATION end and based on what they learned over the next like a few weeks they can actually make a career out of that and that's computer science as well so it ranges from very easy to very hard and lot of people think all computers I've still difficult it's our it's as difficult as you can make it's it's difficult is how hard you will have to try 
Who gave you the best advice about your career?,Chris gave me the best advice about my career would probably be %HESITATION the people that are really close to me %HESITATION when I was going %HESITATION through each of the jobs that I was going to be so for instance %HESITATION you'll probably be the people beside me %HESITATION when I was going to school on that would be like maybe the teachers of instructors %HESITATION once I got my first ship your poly the chiefs and the senior chiefs who %HESITATION kind of give me at least some kind of motivation to be like them I didn't really like six months why I didn't if the advice from the things that they showed me but it's more like what we the way to be in the military we know that par is like more more valuable for me want to stay in the military to keep the military rather than like god this is how you %HESITATION charge a enough electrical devices simply so %HESITATION after I got out of the military I actually was looking more towards on the people and not even in the military so I mean that I US sees by university southern California's institute for creative technologies and I got a lot of really get advice for my military %HESITATION career from people who aren't even in the military themselves %HESITATION just because they have they understand what it takes to be in the military and where the future the military allies and kind without that advice I I I guess I would I wouldn't think about the military to civilian type of way so %HESITATION I'm really thankful so all three of them instructors the US chiefs and see if he's and those civilians had an influence on all my life and my military 
How can I work smarter?,the way that you can be the best at your job the way you were smarter is open up the books I have to say you know I I wasn't really us down %HESITATION engineering type myself you know I think everybody had the upper hand on me I when I first joined by the difference between %HESITATION me a lot of other guys and girls of lower going through the reason that I I can really right through the ranks is because I was opening the books all the time there the scenes called watches that you stand where are you going to sit in the chair you like Watson gauges and make sure that you know nothing's like exploding %HESITATION but that's kinda like free time you know so you can't like recounted looks you can watch a movie there %HESITATION soul with that spare time they actually tell you open up the books you know open up and keep your keep your training going yourself so that's what I used to do that's what I did and it's %HESITATION I found out that month after month you know year after year my knowledge was steadily improving and I think it's has a lot to do with the fact I was reading a lot during my watches 
What would you advise a person in this field to do in order to create good relationships with bosses?,if you wanted to getting good with your boss is your chief CCGS %HESITATION working officer yet like other people superior officers %HESITATION number one it would be good to have a good personality now everybody hates the fact that you know jobs like the military it's any job is political but that is nobody likes to work around people that they don't like %HESITATION if you if you're an introvert it would be a good you be good for your career if I you can kinda like express yourself a little bit you know kind of be friends with the person that's working decided %HESITATION you know I watch a lot of lots of military movies and of see god see people fighting in shooting in you know like a eventually you can see that they become a band of brothers you know even of their gross but band of brothers right that's the that's the thing and %HESITATION if you can try it total you know live up to that will be a stereotype then that would work very well with your superiors because %HESITATION the word %HESITATION the only word that really matters for the military is teamwork and the more they need to so that your team the more that you can like relate to your your peers in that would look really good with your superiors 
Does the Navy give you housing?,throughout your whole military career you you basically are you going to be taken care of %HESITATION regardless of %HESITATION when you're the one court had %HESITATION they provide your housing in it's a different type of way that they provide your food in a different way so this is what I mean when you just join the military %HESITATION they know you don't make that much cast so what they do is they some people be after me make them stay on the ship you know to sleep %HESITATION after you make it's around like the key five the second class petty officer level %HESITATION did they start giving use this thing because %HESITATION D. H. its basic allowance for housing they say if you choose to you're allowed to %HESITATION find an apartment out the how the world NO and will give you money for %HESITATION in other locations if your second class petty officer how they might allow you to stay in on duh houses on base %HESITATION especially if uniform country then you know you're probably staying home base %HESITATION as you get a lot black higher rating like Frances if you're achieve or ZG master chief or if you're an officer at the end 
What has been your favorite place to live?,a lot of different places since I've been in the military one was %HESITATION Charleston South Carolina then I moved up to Albany New York gonna move down across the country to San Diego %HESITATION they didn't up from there so a primer to Washington now they all headed in favor one was really you know like it's I made with lots of people in San Diego %HESITATION permitan was kind of %HESITATION more to the countryside but you can have bigger houses and you can do hiking and skiing you nobody got pretty cold and rainy %HESITATION New York was close to New York %HESITATION York city %HESITATION but how many is that lots of the green trees everywhere you know the house the really big but I it's %HESITATION nothing was around that area you know that there is like no building more than like five five US five stories high you know that's probably pretty %HESITATION so it's got very quiet town and in Charleston South Carolina %HESITATION I guess it's kind of like old style %HESITATION in Warsaw got all those things that I've been home since I've been in a military I the California person so I gotta do this and you 
Did the Navy give you a chance to live overseas?,so the baby did provide some opportunities for me to live overseas I just never liked really capitalized on it so my job is a nuclear technician and %HESITATION unfortunately we're only allowed to stay our domestic however %HESITATION they do give you opportunities to change your role is not your job about how those beacon lectures is made but out of your roles %HESITATION throughout your career that they understand that they can just put somebody on the boat you know for twenty years and think that he'll retire he'll he'll go crazy right so after your %HESITATION tour of maybe a forty four years then they tried to some opportunity to do a different type of work so they can send you to us shore command of its insane Diego where you can like I still have one of the facilities there %HESITATION nobles to us test out of nine to five job %HESITATION the also they offered me and %HESITATION to go to Italy %HESITATION to work on a sub tender %HESITATION which is kinda like being on a little bonus you get lots of court because the stuff so it out that's one opportunity to to go overseas but if you do like god for years on an aircraft carrier then a couple more years on another boat the plot of seat time so that was one opportunity for me harm they also had another aircraft here %HESITATION that was stationed in Japan %HESITATION it was called the USS Kitty Hawk %HESITATION however it like that that's where I was going to go I was into camp like let you know for places in America bored silly to Japan I'm going to Japan and that's where I'm going to go you know but I now the question Leon we weren't able to go on that no no no it's going to be getting worse we just I afford so our homes our domestic soil for the whole time 
What was your promotion track throughout your Navy service?,so everybody joins the military as an E. one %HESITATION into account regardless of your of your rate so when she joined the military you on get some kind of incentive stuff ten tips to join so in a nuclear tech technician %HESITATION we're allowed to become E. threes immediately %HESITATION but into cap everyone's you want so as soon as we can ended up then I was promoted to a fireman as the the engineering side of you three right and I did that for school %HESITATION I was in school for six months and by the time I graduated %HESITATION that school first after six months I was promoted to a first class petty officer before and then I was %HESITATION I would say that nuclear power school and in prototype trading they're both us six months and six months in which microchip now when I finally got my first ship that's I would I had been in for two years and also not because of my my my rate their tech technician are they offered us so automatically be promoted to out of second class petty officer if I and that's what I did they offered us also cast I got forty thousand dollars %HESITATION in cash and his tax free because you're fighting the war and I got automatically promoted to five so %HESITATION up until that time that for the first two years I'd always been automatically promoted %HESITATION either by school or just by joining or or just by signing a contract for an additional two years that are out I can listen to the violence because I I extended my contract six years to eight years arm after that time after though that two years then I was on I got promoted four years later so the six problems I was pretty he five two thousand two from it E. six in two thousand it's six %HESITATION and then %HESITATION I guess it's good to more years in the in the military and then I got out after eight years as a as first class petty officer %HESITATION then I made about chief of which is what I am now the seven you know two thousand ten that's former years after and it so if in the time line is %HESITATION I joined boot camp that's the one after the camp which is about three months I think I was E. three %HESITATION you're in a half later I was I'm sorry six months later I was at the floor advice to your point I wasn't he five and then %HESITATION four years later I was in the sixth in former years after that I wasn't 
What was your salary throughout your Navy service?,so my salary %HESITATION obviously it changes every time I get promoted %HESITATION it also changes every every two years %HESITATION so the longer that you're in the military you get a little bit more money %HESITATION so right now I'm a chief and it depends on which %HESITATION which city you live in which did not gonna dictate your gauge your basic allowance for housing and %HESITATION but everybody's the same basic so my basic payers are right now as %HESITATION forty five hundred dollars per month if I were to be active active duty service and I also get another odd couple thousand dollars are for my my E. H. %HESITATION which is about the money that they give you for housing so all in all it's about about seventy five thousand dollars fear %HESITATION with sixteen years in %HESITATION personally just barely comes in %HESITATION she's not going to get %HESITATION he or she is not going to get that gauge %HESITATION deprived just be living on a ship or something like that and not as far as the basic allowance for those are the basic on a pay it's probably just a couple thousand dollars maybe on three thousand dollars would you talk about outside we can since about home thirty five thousand dollars to start so when you're in the military you're at thirty five thousand %HESITATION sixteen years yet seventy five thousand dollars and that's from if he wants to yeah I think that's according 
Can you explain the ranking system E and numbers?,the military is divided up into two parts yeah that listed and yet also have officers officers are people who have been to college and who have a degree and who have been %HESITATION awarded a commission I would think that %HESITATION their job is to take care of people there the job is to %HESITATION have a command underneath %HESITATION so the people that they hire or call the listener people listen people you know you just have to have a college degree or sorry not caused a high school degree or a GED and now I've been here is that you're able to join the military %HESITATION the center of locational school it's called a school and and from that time then you are actually like the performer the technical person the person who %HESITATION drives the ship or the person who makes the pump or the person who are text the voltage right so armed officers of the person even in charge innocent people are the ones who do it so then listed people have a ranking from you one you know I if you want is %HESITATION it could be well there are three types there are the people that deal with aircraft things people who deal with %HESITATION ship type things and the people who are %HESITATION engineers so %HESITATION the engineers are called fireman the US ship tech people called semen and died efforts here airforce jet type people are called Aaron right so there's a camera crew then you go on airman apprentice and then you have %HESITATION just a regular airman for you three that you want to live %HESITATION after that eat before you fight any six those are called payoffs so %HESITATION any force called the third class petty officer the five second class kitted out Sir any six is first class pretty awesome and then you have about three more which is off with your teeth so how did you seven which is a cheap and they they have a slightly different emblem for for the uniform they're all gold and you can see that this is %HESITATION incur so if you just have this I that's a chief if you're a star right here that's a %HESITATION east E. eight that's a senior chief you have to start right here are that's a master chief so again %HESITATION you want to add three get out Sir third third class second class in first class and the chiefs chief CG Massachusetts officers get their their own 
Can you explain the ranking system O and numbers?,the officers have a step system just like the innocence %HESITATION illicit sailors do so for the officers you have a whole one which is an insane %HESITATION prior heard those from the movies and things like that %HESITATION for %HESITATION too that's lieutenant JG lieutenant junior grade for %HESITATION threes there's a lieutenant all four kids Lieutenant Commander all five his commander those six is a captain and captains are the ones %HESITATION they're basically I really really high and in their in their all officer humidity that the people that a command the ship commanding aircraft carrier those accountants %HESITATION after that then you are have people who have been kept for a long time in there that supersede people that you see on TV because of the adults so you have gravel lower half a brick house by several anyhow that's all seven eight nine ten 
What were your living quarters like in the Navy? (What was the lifestyle? Similar to college?),for me the living quarters in the navy are outstanding %HESITATION lot of people that join the things well it is my first place that I've been staying you know so like I like no matter what it is to have a lot of complaints but I realize and I I I I wouldn't let me see and you know so the fact that they gave me a nice clean bandit with clean furniture and %HESITATION a desk right there you know and that's all again in a closet you know looks like a little ten little hotel you know what kind of a cheap hotel but for me that's that you know if and if I had to scream you know like really good my mind away so %HESITATION that the other things that since they had like prince of the navy gateway in or out of the navy lives there some of the highest quality hotels that you can bye expenses I was in a white couple of couple years ago and I state it like this expensive like three hundred dollar hotel of canoes nice you know there's a bad king size bed and you know where did you stay at the navy lives down the street and it's like huge room with nice fans into you know that there is a lot like that who that the better have its own dork you know the bathtub is like a you can likely swim in it you know it if it's are you outside of it is like a three couches into him there's like TV is for everyone it's it's it's crazy it's has own separate kitchen so like I beat me realize that you know the military people that are traveling across the country %HESITATION they need a nice place to stay so it's it's some of the best places I've stayed now the the place that the military provides for the sailors it's you know very quite odd but those but the please that that how you go on corporate case in or out of that place that apple stay at or the places that you have to like I paid for that you're not that isn't for official work out there they're some of the nicest and in America 
What are common crimes that military people commit?,some of the crimes that people commit with here in the military almost always deal with it drinking so for instance let's say there's a robbery chances are there's alcohol involved %HESITATION it's it's that are %HESITATION if there's a crash spy how the whole involves if there is a fight tools are there is alcohol involved so I say that %HESITATION the common crime is drinking alcohol played that's not a crime in itself %HESITATION the other things are kind of collateral damage so yeah you feel %HESITATION if you're on a ship four year then you will see that somebody has dropped one person on the ship has robbed somebody out there in the world %HESITATION you will hear about four bytes byte bytes that you know like I got people you know devoted %HESITATION and you will hear about three drunk driving's maybe I'm very good there is no cast for the just got caught for it so that's because of the compound today but I see 
Did you receive a monetary bonus for enlisting?,receive a cash bonus if you list depending on the needs of the navy so if we're about to fight a war or if we're in the middle of a war then you can expect not that they're trying to increase the size of the military and for that can be provided lotus %HESITATION if there if it's kinda peacetime affair downsizing maybe then on the **** they offer less though it's it's a it's a it's a sci seeping tool that the navy has %HESITATION to get people to come in Italy with that said %HESITATION in most cases for their advanced jobs on they always have some kind of loan incident it ranges in them now but %HESITATION if it's there nonetheless so though about that I received %HESITATION if they gave me the choice they said I could have twelve thousand dollars in cash %HESITATION you know my taxes or you could have a really big %HESITATION educational policies of fifty thousand dollars so I I knew I was going to go to college on it and I want to make sure that like I didn't you know like I spend the money %HESITATION really so I set out to be the educational bonus at the end %HESITATION a lot of people that I knew like %HESITATION because the first year I was in you know people had new cars are made because documents on like a nice musical equipment and stuff like that so some other %HESITATION jobs that you should have that right but this is our home obviously a lot of stem job so there's a lectures lecture since may that's not inside out of the nuclear field but just regular doctors like Christians %HESITATION there's %HESITATION fire control men FC's so those the ones who picks like our all of that from from India plants up %HESITATION that is like the top participants not dealing with the injury nuclear site just off managing it up you know deftly pretty bright too so they get bonuses Adam could logical technicians that can that learn languages for the spies are the ones who are like us listening you know like a try to find out what %HESITATION for people are are up to the castle this is so jobs like that %HESITATION if they're the ones who can get most the biggest bonuses 
Can you tell me about military retirement?,maybe has some of the past retirement packages in the United States that's hands down after you've been in for twenty years then you're allowed to have retirement at the end of your twenty years you can either on safety I would like to retire resist in %HESITATION so thirty years so every year that you're in %HESITATION you get to have two and a half percent longer than twenty years at twenty years to get half of your basic pay so %HESITATION that's what I mean the navy gives you lots of money while you're in %HESITATION based on certain things sixty percent of what you make is your basic pay are the you get a little more for it on sustenance which is odd yes it's a thing that you need for your for your home %HESITATION yes I get a little bit more for it with ya if you're on a submarine or not I'll have to get some more help is lousy housing for your housing costs but sixty percent of that is a you basically so the navy gives you half that as a twenty year point I've achieved I make forty five hundred dollars per month so they give me half of that contact twenty years if I can sustain longer than the add on another it would have to say would have to say what happened person %HESITATION depending on how what I retire as it can be up to thirty years so at thirty years they'll be seven five percent of your basic pay now %HESITATION because I'm the chief I think forty five hundred hundred per month but they basically take your your highest three months upgrading and those that's the because that that they provide you for 
Describe the hiring process.,but everyone to join the military then you have to go to one of the defense service branches so there's one and %HESITATION every major city are sometimes they have %HESITATION too so %HESITATION going to whichever one you feel you might most my most be fitted for %HESITATION actually try to join the airforce at first but %HESITATION idea of the navy %HESITATION there's gonna be somebody behind a desk that's going to you know what can you please have a seat %HESITATION so why you would enjoy it what kinds of things interest you other ask lots of questions about like a how did the high school %HESITATION what your interests are and out see if you're a good fit %HESITATION they also try to see if you have a kind of criminal background and if %HESITATION if you seem %HESITATION maybe I'm committed they probably %HESITATION pushed to the side bled out of it if they want to give everybody a chance so %HESITATION after you have your initial conversation with him he'll ask you to take a practice test to be right there at that same time %HESITATION so they're pretty rules got to another room and the test is kind of like a little mini %HESITATION it's classic achievement test it's a though many SAT army has a little bit of %HESITATION physics there back there %HESITATION you'll love it if he was there %HESITATION just general general things so you have to be scared of the test it's not a pass or fail it's more like %HESITATION what types of jobs you can have so if you take the test and where you score he'll say how he has a list of maybe sixty seventy jobs he's the one that you qualify for on if you don't qualify for the job you want then you're allowed to practice a little bit more he'll give you all some resources that can I use to study %HESITATION but %HESITATION by that time if you are decided on the type of job that you want that you're willing to to do their job he will take you to %HESITATION here she will take you to other things talk baskets are military entrance processing %HESITATION processing place that you can go to with lots of other people who are anxious to join the military take the real test are the real test is our nice and quiet yet it's a lot lot longer %HESITATION it's very comprehensive and %HESITATION that's when they can no cut off you that the real job if the pie service a breakfast in the morning it's all the thing and are so that you pass the test on the same day they can also have %HESITATION get you there medical at that time which means that they'll take your eyes %HESITATION check your dental make sure that you're physically fit so so to look through it and %HESITATION maybe the entire recruiting process could take of maybe a week maybe even a couple of days I have heard but %HESITATION for me it took several months %HESITATION think they have you in this thing called %HESITATION at the late entrants processing where you do your test if you got the job that you want and %HESITATION maybe you don't have to join the service until a good time for them which is like a year later or maybe after your your high school %HESITATION after you graduate high school or after you finish your job or something 
Describe the initial training.,after you them with %HESITATION your initial entrance processing for the military then your hardware to the lookout the camp is about three months and out of the she knew it uncivil things tying knots %HESITATION to medicate with other people on how to do drill formations you know things that you see an awful metal jacket %HESITATION if you want to watch the first %HESITATION first half that movie that you did that with the camp %HESITATION tries to be like after that then you're on where to your first vocational school which is on called a school %HESITATION it ranges in size might make it my school six months %HESITATION but it could be as short as two weeks %HESITATION so in general it's it's generate a couple months I after that time I did use was the glove to your ship let's hear it and advanced program like I was which case you're going to another school %HESITATION my next school is a nuclear power school and now for another six months I mean after that that I had a lot of prototype trading which is which means that the city tour of a real prototype how to train on the real thing of good people watching me of course and that was six months you know it's much 
What is bootcamp like?,camp is initial training that all military members go through so you go to this out place and how in the in the Chicago area and they put you in a minute in a division it's about maybe thirty people or so %HESITATION it it's very very strict there everybody's in love bets as %HESITATION be teach you how to make make your bed but it's a very special way all the cases have to be aligned perfectly although it seems have to be super clean and you know facing the same way so it's not when they teach you to make this bad it's not the fact that they want you to make a bed dissuade it's the fact that they're looking to make sure that you can follow directions they give you a list of steps and there they make sure that number one you don't talk back to them number two that you you I do it at the time that is suppose to be done at six o'clock or at five o'clock in the morning you don't with me standing outside here your bed that is already being made %HESITATION these the they make sure that there's nothing on the bed or inside the bed with that it's all be the same way %HESITATION so there's a lot that goes into making this bad so I see %HESITATION omitting the spare part because everything about the cap is the exact same way from the books that you train on to that not that you're making two of the way the way that you do your drills it's not that they're trying to teach you these things are they are but they're actually filtering out cool can please no problem with following directions and who needs a little bit more time %HESITATION took to train in these things and for some reason like let's say you have to come from a bad neighborhood you don't like to talk to and yell that %HESITATION those are people that would have problems if they go out into the real service so they take those people to decide maybe I'm Deborah Kemp for live it longer or maybe they actually get kicked out of the account but %HESITATION by the time you get done with your three months or four months of two counts %HESITATION you should have a good idea of what discipline is like and what %HESITATION how to follow directions %HESITATION from the simplicity asked a more complex 
What are the different types of careers in computer science?,really crop field so what do you like to work with your hands or whether you like to work with their minds %HESITATION there's something for everybody so for the people that %HESITATION like to get into the machine how you can do hardware computer hardware and %HESITATION that's window you open it up and you look at the mother for check the the voltage on it if you're going to be like fixing it we're gonna try to figure out like on how to design everything in a nice you know I got it ten inch by eight inch wheels will square you know like I so that all fits %HESITATION so however the US be of a certain spot %HESITATION if you want to %HESITATION deal with the way that particular looks on that could be like web design %HESITATION there's there's this thing called %HESITATION like out cascading style sheets where of the they make regular text like my name is Clint and to make it like a big blue bright colorful and you know make it dancing are all on the screen %HESITATION so it doesn't take that that much of computer science knowledge till I got to do web design that's what's really popular field love of people who are just getting it up getting into could get now if Europe mechanical up inside mathematically inclined then you can start thinking about on the way that %HESITATION the letters dance on the screen or the way that Marla jumps or the way out Marla being a hobby to get care or the way that %HESITATION that an operating system like does the process that it's doing behind the scenes so %HESITATION like let's say there's a little bit of math that goes into it %HESITATION nothing to complex Arnold would not deal with calculus here but %HESITATION we are dealing with %HESITATION very it's hard to describe army and when you think of computer science just being smart you think about programmers that those are the ones who are talking about programs are the ones who %HESITATION open up an application and they start quoting inside and out they they tell the computer computer listen to me can you please open this application and %HESITATION make this job and make this when it when I press the enter key make sure that %HESITATION the program closes and another program opens and and this is the first word that shows up on the screen when I do this it also programs are they actually program the computer septa to work %HESITATION another thing is because its graphics where is this the way that the light reflects from the computer so %HESITATION you can give you kind of think about the way that %HESITATION TV screens have look throughout the ages %HESITATION first they can in black and white they may have little bit of color and then they had %HESITATION a lot more pizzazz and if there is very very sharp now %HESITATION TV is now they look like a real real life by people as opposed like a blurry ones from before so the people in graphics they're the ones who constantly make sure that the programmers %HESITATION do the right code so that %HESITATION the computer knows how to do it really fast and so that like out the light that reflects doesn't make the computer slow and that it looks really clear to the tip of your so on that loser several of the many computer science jobs that are available ranging from the really a hardware based to the graphics to the programming to the graphics there anymore 
Who do I talk to if I'm interested in this computer science?,if you're thinking about becoming a computer science is yourself I would have to say that %HESITATION the first thing you should do is probably look online cicada I'll find out about with different types of jobs there are and what it what it is they do armed with a little bit of experience would limit of light up browsing around a little gonna get idea about it but it it they don't really tell you exactly what they do so next person it would be probably %HESITATION someone in the field obviously %HESITATION if you can find in a massive computer scientist and go for it you know by %HESITATION any university student who's out who's your junior senior level and they have your basic programming skills they have your basic idea of what computer theory involves so I'm just asking a couple questions you know whether it's been hard for them whether on anybody with a with a normal high school degree can like kinda do this work whether of whether the job that they're doing is really really complex %HESITATION it you pay ranges so %HESITATION they might not be the guy do the best that they can give you an idea of like kind of where you fit in and whether it's I agree that you want to try to solve 
What is dress attire in the Navy?,our uniform reduce a lot from clothes that you wear everyday like this %HESITATION these are camouflage home this is a temperature that I'm wearing and matching pants and really hard rock hard boots %HESITATION that machine does W. cope and %HESITATION gone up to %HESITATION your dress blues which is I got we're going to a very special occasion %HESITATION maybe some kind of ceremony %HESITATION that's that you need to look very presentable would reckon in your grasp %HESITATION so other other uniforms and where %HESITATION I wear khakis chiefs which is the seven year nine %HESITATION and officers they've they way things call khakis which is like a nice pressed uniform it's brown with white right here is that in this little had %HESITATION that's impacts %HESITATION you can work in them but but generally closer to the people that I'm kind of over see people %HESITATION working %HESITATION the workers on the other hand they can wear these things called coveralls which is %HESITATION he brings you back to your five year old days which is like a one piece body suit you can put one leg in one leg put your arms over in the sense of it all the way up and %HESITATION could rose looked like the things that people that change oil %HESITATION their clothes they wear the solution if you're at home think about something your oil he gets on that like sliding machine thing goes up under the car the whole entire uniformity is on it that's what can what %HESITATION coveralls look like in their ability except for that there for the navy 
To what extent does the military adhere to tight schedules both long term and daily?,since you're going to be in the military you have to make sure that you're on time for things so %HESITATION if you show up late then people look at you Hey you know come on time S. I'm usually twice then you sold it comely three times then %HESITATION tests are you %HESITATION sitting in front of a chief having him you know and others he's like %HESITATION cannot count on you and you do it four times then down then you probably written up %HESITATION the council check which means that like I said Hey you know I like you told this guy it's a cost for being fired from the military so make sure that you don't do it again so %HESITATION yeah if if that's not true that's a that's a deal you know you'd like so kind when everyone you see it re Stephanie vocabulary because the navy's pretty tight with their schedule 
How can I request to work in a certain area or field?,I feel that you want to work in it is specifically guided by how well you did on the test so basically you're a so %HESITATION it's very important to a kind of if you do want to work on %HESITATION demanding field try try to score as high as you can army if you don't get the job you want %HESITATION when you've tried first try in before you joined try to you know open up a little bit you know to to try to get that job so what you're in the military %HESITATION Dennis W. a big range of job that you can do %HESITATION you could work in the library to work %HESITATION you know with with electrical components can work if you don't at least for for me quite as electricity item white reason things that I can that I can do so if you try to ask which job I can do %HESITATION which job can I apply for %HESITATION lot of its kind of political lot of its %HESITATION well you know like we've known him for a while he's gonna sit for a long time so like he had he has a choice since you just come to the ship been like this is the only job that we have for you you know you could be you know painting this this deck or hit me scrubbing his Florida right that that's the doctor we have free but if you've been in for a lot longer than you know you have a little the way in asking for jobs and again you know within your rate com depends on how high you score so for instance there's going to be people who who will be providing work to other people who are going to be writing that down of writing their job descriptions out and providing you need those people to be some of the brightest of us so if I if you don't have a good British street then you pie might not be able to apply for for that job so one try to score as high as possible problem in number to try to learn on the job as much as possible that's how you can get a desk job that you 
What was the most difficult part of your training?,the most difficult part of training I gotta say it's probably the material at least for nuclear technology I wasn't and I wasn't a very good student %HESITATION I I got good grades but it was really difficult for me to come out learn the material myself like for instance of one of things that we we learned is %HESITATION what grounds are you know and it took me so long to figure out what it round is like grounded me this is the earth you know like what you mean by that eventually find out that ground means that like that's a plane of %HESITATION %HESITATION neutral %HESITATION no neutral electricity so that you can have a Hyatt Hyatt will teach them little trees and ground means that is here and in that is a way to learn it but you just sent me a really long time to learn because I wasn't really on technical so %HESITATION that's a really one simple I think I learned that you know like I had to catch up on but they're a lot more complex things you know like when you learned about multiplex you're learning about %HESITATION the way that the voltage regulator really works on me in you know those to be our really difficult so it's a wrap your head around but %HESITATION eventually %HESITATION with enough opening the pages and put your eyes on it over and over and over on it become simple %HESITATION everything becomes simple what about 
What is the most difficult part of computer science?,the most difficult part about learning %HESITATION what computer science is in getting into it is %HESITATION getting past the first block that you have that I had not thinking that it's difficult thinking that computer science is something for other people think about %HESITATION think that it's for smart people perform math people or for people that got four point nose in school you know it's it's not you know you have a wide range of any other job out there so %HESITATION let's get past that then you get the in yep the arm realized the book that you're reading %HESITATION maybe is written by computer scientists and stuff you know so they could be time to get to close the book and go you know prep yourself a little bit more you know find some material online find some easy easy easy to understand topics that can kind of crap you to go back to the more difficult %HESITATION book that you're reading in your hands so you have the material can be hard sometimes %HESITATION that the projects that we have to be you know really really demand but %HESITATION with enough time you know they say seven years to become an expert %HESITATION what ten thousand hours no next week so you put in that time did you learn computers 
How would you describe the work culture of the Navy?,for me it's just been one big university Greek life style it it's just a whole bunch of you know young kids getting together you know drinking on the weekends %HESITATION kind of partying on Sundays in %HESITATION coming in you know like ready to work on Monday through Thursday %HESITATION but you know the weekend is there is NO even after the hour is done you know even after the work breaking time is done %HESITATION that they're still there's lots of video games going on there's lots of card playing that that goes on you know during the work day %HESITATION there looking at each other and making jokes %HESITATION you know doing %HESITATION you know I got lot lot of like that's how these things all the time so they keep it fun sometimes %HESITATION and just like with all young kids you know that I like there there's lots of arguments lots of they make you know just like any any other if this is a high school all over again in some cases without more discipline for the things that require the discipline 
How does an officer's/non-officer's salary compare to civilian salaries?,salaries that the noise here that the military people make they kind of %HESITATION range in and how they compare to what civilians may so officers kind of me slightly less than their civilian counterparts and that is it off so you can take any officer and put it in a civilian job fighting making about a ten to twenty thousand dollars more explicitly %HESITATION however there's a lot of job security that comes with %HESITATION with being in the military %HESITATION you not going to get fired unless you like released really messed up %HESITATION now that you're protecting our country and you're doing it for for it in an efficient manner you know you don't effectively %HESITATION so there's a cost of that and the cost is our salary so there is a saying that the military well don't make that much and it can be true in some cases %HESITATION however you know if you're with pride and you can joy you work and you think about that excellent retirement benefits that that they give you %HESITATION you see that maybe it by the end of your twenty years you know you can make that much less %HESITATION however like you have a much more feelings filigree for off our I'm sorry for illicit people %HESITATION it should be gave a similar or even better %HESITATION your civic counterparts police for nuclear technicians %HESITATION we need only a lot less I have been receiving counterparts we've we %HESITATION in fact many people get out after six or eight years and then I'll be stuck working into the they could easily make double what they're what they're making that is they believe has a first class petty officer in thinking about sixty five or seventy thousand dollars a year and then they can make %HESITATION double that %HESITATION Pat isn't working as Homer Simpson you know down down at the nuclear power plant %HESITATION other things %HESITATION like I may be this eight o'clock or both since made or a weapons handler on the can find gave a similar jobs out there so they didn't have a choice placed in the military that I'd put in like a maybe seven years then or I do I become a civilian big have style liver but Tom started a higher higher rate that fire jobs in that it would have if I would just join from high school so many people that in that position device standing military because on the retirements and the thought of having put in it as far as the pride on all of that so 
How significant is there a chance of being deployed?,everyone in the military that is on the ship will be deployed at sometime so our schedule it is we do one and a half years on the shore and then we do six months at sea do that twice and after that time happier that four year period then you're scheduled so cool work condo on a short command and that should be anywhere from two to three years so it depends on where they're at war at whether we're at where not where there are a temple is %HESITATION Israeli higher not %HESITATION whether the ship that you're on has been out to see a lot but that's generally %HESITATION that the two years the two year ship shore %HESITATION schedule is telling what it is 
What things are there for me to do on a ship?,we're going to ship you have a lot of opportunities available to now I will live the biggest if you're on the more opportunities that are available so you have a really small ship let's say %HESITATION a destroyer that's not a small but like up the destroyer is %HESITATION so I guess a ship that has maybe a couple thousand people on it %HESITATION it's kind of like a high school you could say of the size of a high school and %HESITATION there aren't that many things to do I've never been on a destroyer but I just know from this from you know myspace with Erica care of that it has to have less than what what I had and %HESITATION list for your pet care which has five thousand people %HESITATION usually will run the planet we have goes up to eight thousand people you had all the people that come in with a airplanes and the people like to hear their plans and then in that extra officers enlisted people %HESITATION eight thousand people is the size of a small city so on an aircraft carrier we have our own post office we have %HESITATION our own little recreation center we have a couple of places %HESITATION for fitness %HESITATION but in general if it is a work crap that's therefore there aren't that many their limited places %HESITATION their limited places that you can do that could have on the ship that catered to entertain so people find own entertainment so for me my entertainment on the ship was %HESITATION and watch movies all the time so everybody has their own little laptop or their media player %HESITATION you can rent movies from the little Bob recreation center that's there %HESITATION they had %HESITATION it ends in little spurts hidden spots of the ship so there be drums and guitars and %HESITATION you know like even keyboards you know like like all hidden but that did they make space and you know I but he plays out as they want %HESITATION obviously the fitness centers are there and %HESITATION you can see card playing all over the place I would whenever there is %HESITATION a rack living quarter then there's %HESITATION this little table outside you know like three or four of them so it and with couches to watch TV to watch movies and to play cards right there so that's how we spent our deployments 
Why should someone choose to be a part of the Navy?,I chose to be a part of the navy %HESITATION yes because I wanted to further my career and have you know that salary %HESITATION all the benefits but I also feel that you have to serve your country at sometime in your life now I know that sounds cliche played %HESITATION that that's the way that I feel I came from a relief military family my uncle was in the military my dad was in the military my brother was in the military and %HESITATION need to it had although yes I could of %HESITATION just been a civilian I I was on that path %HESITATION it felt like at least for me in particular felt like something would've been missing from my life something I can be on my death bed and see that I never protect my country the way that I saw my family protected so it is it it is a calling for me %HESITATION Hwy with other people join the military specially if you don't have a military people in your family %HESITATION you have to think well first you have to trust your politicians you have to think that they're going to war and the defending America %HESITATION for good reason so the wars that we fight we hope will bring stability to the world on you might see on TV that you know %HESITATION children are are are are bloodied and %HESITATION people are you know like on running for their lives running from terrorism running for a %HESITATION lots of different things you know you seem to do so if you wanna be a part of bringing that's when it %HESITATION then military is one way that you can that was try %HESITATION also defending defending the nation now even say for a long time %HESITATION yes we had nine eleven and yes there are terrorists but repaired so you know other countries in the world you might realize that America is a pretty safe place to live %HESITATION we can sitting on foreign powers trying to try to come in it influence us so we have that strong military to to thank for that so if you want to be a part of that team you know I have a lot of the staff of bettering of all for for your character for as long as you live then the navy would be a good spot to start 
Why should someone choose to go into CS?,when you think about your future career %HESITATION computer science could be one of the funniest things that you can do I know for me I I think something is classes and our callers and map classes and %HESITATION let's all the classes and the one that I actually wanted to do homework for the one that finish the homework assignment and I wanted to keep working on it afterwards %HESITATION despite what the you know despite my grade despite you know like whether to get on it and I spike we are being graded on and on it was computer science that's one of the only ones that data that affected me like that %HESITATION if you want to maybe make your own business %HESITATION with you with your laptop that based on things that are in your mind things that you're coming up with on the fly science would be a good choice if you want to not be in the in the music industry %HESITATION and work on like %HESITATION different different sounds and and processes in and I I guess computer science that has a has a big deal with music as well and his movies as well %HESITATION my my my job for %HESITATION my my major at you you know university southern California is a game development and as it turns out games are actually more more turn out more profit in movies nowadays so %HESITATION if you like games than computer science could relate it goes off 
What are the long-term impacts of entering computer science or STEM fields?,the impact that you can have as an engineer and critically computer scientists are are amazing so when I was in the military I need a job and I notice that %HESITATION whatever I did on January the first wouldn't really be %HESITATION recognized high December thirty first is because I'm doing the same job %HESITATION that's fine for a lot of people in but for me I chose to try something different din that milk in the military job that I was doing because I wanted I wanted my job to be consistent so this is what I mean right now I'm with the university southern California institute creative technology is making this video this video can be seen by thousands hundreds of thousands hopefully millions of other needy people I could affect those lives the cities are things that that are going to be happening you know five years from now ten years from now %HESITATION so I can actually affect my world many engineering communities are like that if you're making a robot right if you make that relied on January the first but hopefully December thirty first you shipping that will buy and that will buy this one go to Afghanistan tak incentive find a bomb you know if you're %HESITATION and electrical technician maybe you're making %HESITATION making some kind of new component for car and later on that because of the faster because of the component you made for so %HESITATION lot of engineering jobs you work and then you create a component you create a product and then you can see that product in action and %HESITATION that's one of the biggest benefits of being in a simple 
How do you and your work colleagues socialize outside of work?,there's a lot of socializing socialization that happens outside of the military %HESITATION for military members obvious what I mean so you you with these guys %HESITATION from the morning until you know work in that like for five o'clock and so you think that Hey you know what I got it soon job you take off you know do my own thing but %HESITATION it turns out that when these are your friends you know these were guys and joking around with he's the guy that you get on the plane with them you have to see them everyday %HESITATION you can you become very much like family you know very much like brothers saw and sisters so %HESITATION as soon as we're against the same guys are going to be going to the local bar and %HESITATION intriguing in chatting in the division going some of his house I think video games and stuff so %HESITATION it's very very close here 
What is the gender mix of your workplace?,the database is it's very male oriented %HESITATION just like any engineering any engineering academic field %HESITATION the best way over to sentiment so the navy's pretty good about that airforce is the best I think they're they're you know getting close like sixty forty eight percent that means tired even higher no subpoena ratio thing they need is a little bit lower inside from what I understand maybe my my aircraft carrier was one quarter female %HESITATION at least that's that's kind of what I saw on that that's about what it was %HESITATION but it could be lower %HESITATION maybe twenty percent is by what I'm guessing %HESITATION engineering field of the navy is %HESITATION on submarines did you know which ones you're you're going on if it's a fast attack submarines I think they just barely started out just a couple years ago started allowing females on and if you're on a ballistic submarine which means I'll be soft nuclear weapons off and I think they don't have deals on there at all 
What are the ethnic percentages of your workplace?,it is pretty diverse I think it also depends on which location you're in because our people tend to go back to where they come from so let's say South Carolina which is %HESITATION very wide then pi has a higher percentage of white people there %HESITATION in %HESITATION California which is very very diverse you have a lot more you know a diverse mix there you know so %HESITATION but despite that %HESITATION where ever there's a military town much more diverse than that outlying area is by far so you don't really have to worry about %HESITATION about %HESITATION being in a select group %HESITATION in the military if it's it's all over the place so I think from what I saw of there's a hype personages public pie go five percent Filipino maybe ten percent black maybe fifty percent white Tim twenty percent Asian and then the rest the rest is up to kind of mix but like I said it really depends on what your weight is %HESITATION for maybe the higher level rains it tends to be mostly white and Asian %HESITATION and it also depends on which state you live in on or if it is good that want to come back to it to look around the 
Why do people leave this field or company?,there are a lot of reasons that people leave the military %HESITATION the military has a lot of babies is the statement of the retirement benefits the job security %HESITATION serve the country however %HESITATION I think especially when people want to make a higher salary and the find the good job outside and they want to just try to do something else %HESITATION been that could be a good motivating factor %HESITATION military can be dangerous so is this like for the people that I con sin the planes off %HESITATION if you do that you know every single year month day after day then that could affect your hearing %HESITATION you can be enough if you mean dangerous situations and %HESITATION some people just don't don't want to do that type of data to break the can be risky %HESITATION another reason that people live a techie believe the military is because how they want to see their family grow when your deployment that's get six months that you don't see your daughter girl does your son grow you not with your wife you have with your husband so %HESITATION after a few of those deployments you you can now start to miss that yes we want to see when when you spouse has the kid you know if if your wife is pregnant you want to actually see it be born and and a lot of people who work there for that so that's the third reason that I see a lot of people if the military 
Why do people leave the CS/STEM field?,yes or what ever since two thousand and eight and it's two thousand sixteen so I think years and I would say I'm really perfect that it I think to be one of the students make a high salary a computer science you have to be really good at it %HESITATION that that's hands down if you just kinda average then you make an average salary so %HESITATION but having a really good job is on the top of every it's my but not everybody is so great it %HESITATION so me I'm in Japan a study a lot yeah open books in them on online tutorials out to try to get to that point %HESITATION if I don't get to that point then maybe I would try to do something similar to computer science but maybe not they are %HESITATION there's web designing there's electricity is made %HESITATION there are lots of jobs that it like for instance a director of the city jobs so I think if other people are if other computer scientists are like me then I guess they might become discouraged because the job that they're trying to do is difficult and it's hard to learn those difficult things 
"How will my relationship with my friends or family members be affected if I join the navy, and what advice should i give them?",I think that there will be two major things that anybody who knows you %HESITATION what kind of think about you %HESITATION after you join the military number one is they'll give you a lot of respect they know what the military does you know everybody knows you know like how how the military you don't fight these wars and if they're Americans if I have a they give a lot of credit for risking your life for them number two there will probably be scared they be scared for your life %HESITATION especially going to go fight a war and they be scared for your safety are because the military is I've had a lot of %HESITATION daters places %HESITATION outside of work so %HESITATION respect for you and fear for you %HESITATION if you can kind of manage those to vindicate kind of convince them Hey you know I'd like to the military could be the right choice and it is as much as you want my safety you have to realize I got the job introduced like for everybody 
How do the educational benefits of the military work?,what you join the military you're a part of a group that %HESITATION really want success succeed especially educationally so we have this thing called tuition assistance drives you twenty five hundred dollars per month %HESITATION actually twenty five dollars it in in one year %HESITATION to take %HESITATION anything any class any community college classes you want %HESITATION we also have %HESITATION among them is ideal which we the nine eleven %HESITATION educational benefit for people who are who have served and get out of the military I wanna on their continue their education you can use it while in the military but it's kind of a waste because they'll give you as much as I because people get out actually get and there's also I this thing called flex its it's basically they give you on they allow you to take some courses %HESITATION that provide community college %HESITATION course credit on that specifically for for the military and now many of those courses are free so you can actually like what torture college degrees because flat cap click courses %HESITATION for like a while you're on the plane in which is when you're out by fighting were off for six months or more when you're back home maturity %HESITATION during your off time %HESITATION you can also like to do some kind of %HESITATION online community community college courses for you to take a university courses are they provide lots of love veterans benefits maybe free benefits of that to take the class or opt just 
What is the advancement potential in the field? What is a typical path?,if that's what you have when you're in the military it really depends on the job that you have so I deliciousness made %HESITATION nuclear trained so at the end of %HESITATION six or eight years not many people actually like leave the leave the service so because that happens %HESITATION there's a wide open range for people that want to keep progressing on because like the tops open so that means that you know they train and then once I get that point because nobody had of them them then they get the rate of there's also lots of lecture since mates available %HESITATION like jobs available so if you're in a job that has %HESITATION only a few spots available but let's say it's a very specific job for a specific ship or %HESITATION or job that's really really nice really comfortable and no one wants to leave then that means that out of those higher positions staying there %HESITATION if they don't retire after eight years or ten years the least Intel twenty that means that that's gonna block so %HESITATION you'll be helpful for you to figure out which job getting and try to ask about the advancement until early on that you know that you're in a job that can promote easily and fast 
How will my experience transfer to civilian life after my navy tour of duty?,when you transfer into civilian life it really depends on what type of job you had when you're in the military service so %HESITATION I was electricity which means that the word electricity is a part of lots of jobs out there so you shouldn't be too difficult to find a job that kind of fits my job on the ship %HESITATION hustle the nuclear %HESITATION with the nuclear technician and obviously there are there are much fewer jobs out there for that %HESITATION but but they can they can be found so every job that's in the military has %HESITATION basic breakdown of all the things that they performed in in a very general categories so some are more classroom move in others if you were gone nuclear weapons than in %HESITATION chances are there there are that many %HESITATION this out for you I compared it leaked out that any offer out there however if you're a cook let's say then you know every city every town every every stop has %HESITATION so every place that that you know has software for kids has it has a job that you can apply for so %HESITATION really depends on the type of job that the type of job that you get 
What is a story that really shows what it is like being in the Navy?,story that really shows what its like to be in the military I have to say will be Oliver stone's full metal jacket if you haven't watched it go ahead and watch it because then you'll understand what boot camp is like and %HESITATION the time that he had %HESITATION after it happened you can't see was %HESITATION was during a war and %HESITATION depends on where you're watching this where the you are in a war not but %HESITATION I think everything from the way that we talk to each other to the uniforms that they where so the the the the jokes that they make %HESITATION it's very very similar to how a military people at so so what that movie and if you have a much better idea about what the navy's like 
What do navy reservists do and what benefits do they get?,I'm in the military reserves and it is exactly what the name says it's a reserve so with we don't actively fight the words what we do is we number one make sure that we are prepared to fight and number two train allowed to make sure that %HESITATION our mind is ready to fight for me I was in the military for eight years and then I got out join the reserves what that means is that the reserves to call me at any time and they'll have somebody with eight years of active duty experience %HESITATION being able to buy that means I I know we ship it is I know how to meet the legal plates to find out what I'm looking for I know had %HESITATION %HESITATION fix these pumps and I know how to drive the ship I don't have you noticed the bows close %HESITATION when we should try to sell off steam no so these are things that they don't have to teach %HESITATION as opposed to a a civilian who has no experience no training and maybe that doesn't have the discipline to come in fight the war right away so if we're going to fight a war first people of that go over aren't active duty people if you need more people in the colony the reservist people %HESITATION that his have a reserve person who stops his normal civilian job and becomes an active duty members for the amount of time and then he tells me to be %HESITATION we could be anywhere from a few months so several years after that time themselves to come back to my civilian job hopefully discipline jobs still there for me when I get back %HESITATION if there's a huge war then that's when we start on it real soon 
What experience is necessary to become an officer?,officer you need two basic things number one you need a college degree time at but that's a requirement number two you need to be able to present a good it managerial style people need to think that you can lead aren't they just because you have a degree doesn't mean that you're you have the authority or or %HESITATION does mean that you have the presence of command so get people to follow you so what you're going through the process of training program their leader teach that to you or they %HESITATION don't allow you to %HESITATION join the military service %HESITATION they would basically take you out so you need a college degree and you need to be able to supervise 
How do you handle supervisors who were unable or unwilling to give you feedback? (asked: How do you get good feedback?),with any job is incredibly important to have a good source of feedback for the job that you do if you're in a position where it like you supervisor doesn't give you this is the feedback that you need he doesn't so you the right way to do things armed with the navy's really good for is %HESITATION having multiple resources to go to so of course %HESITATION if you have when chief above you and your illicit person and he's not listening to you then %HESITATION what they say is that you can go above him this is not generally a expected that you do that but it is possible you know everybody from the captain of the ship all the way down %HESITATION it for the most part has an open door policy which means that if something on your mind you can come I've talked %HESITATION gently they like you to follow the higher so the first question that they were able to ask is did you ask the person underneath me so besides you %HESITATION if you if you have a problem with someone above you you talk to the people she left to right %HESITATION then you talk to the people let's say let's say is that you feel you complaining about so the chief and then if neither of those lists and %HESITATION then seen chief or maybe the office of the unit and onwards so %HESITATION if you have a problem your feedback there's lots of resources that you can go to 
What are the most important decisions that you faced as a leader in your organization?,some of the most important decisions that it pays have to do with morality I would say so here's what I mean the most important thing is to do in the military is follow directions but not everybody does that fortunately and your tasks at its best is a supervisor to confront these things and %HESITATION take care of them appropriately so this is what I this is what I mean let's say that there is somebody on the ship coming out of the ship any struck and he's not supposed to be drunk what do you do so you could either god by the collar and taken to a local master at arms this person in trouble right and that's the right thing to do another right thing to do would be to chastise him to handle it in house to make sure that he does it again to kind of supervising and mentor him %HESITATION if you think that that he's that type of person so you don't have to necessarily ruin his career or on so so basically it's a it's a morality question the type of personality that you have and how willing to stick to the books you are so make sure that you do the right thing %HESITATION when it comes to a %HESITATION things that are going on in that sense things are going on in there into engineering field %HESITATION there's no morality involved if I if that thing is leaking you don't think Hey you know like %HESITATION sit sit sit I exited I was not that big know that there if it's leaking didn't explain why but when you're dealing with people are people with personalities people with emotions people with families %HESITATION you have to really take all that into consideration and to determine the wise thing to do not necessarily the thing that's written in the book 
Who gave you the best advice about your life?,person who probably gave me the best advice about my life I have to say it would be my friends %HESITATION especially my navy fans I love a good friend he was a fellow nuclear the kitchen with me %HESITATION we've been learning computer science together %HESITATION we fought through %HESITATION our electricity trainings together %HESITATION and he went off and did his own thing and I'll just the conversation that we have you know it's like sitting around you know with some coffee he bears a talk about like will what do you want to be well I wanna be this what you want to be %HESITATION for instance he actually taught me %HESITATION a lot about mortgages and stuff I read this in this book that he presented its I thought rich dad poor dad by Robert Kiyosaki and now after reading that book then I kinda got ideas like okay will readily cubicle thing that if I want to make my own Disney right there you know like have some kind of other income rather than %HESITATION within fifty nine to five job %HESITATION or rather of you talk about %HESITATION his prior relationship and on the fact that like his wife maybe didn't want to work so much %HESITATION and we thought about like the income and how calm of his of of %HESITATION one how about one working party system you know like if one person that American now another person just takes care of kids Daniel %HESITATION I guess you can be as rich as normally would be so that had an effect on that the person that I wanna I wanna meet it features %HESITATION what do I want like a housewife which is which is fine you know she could have a it's like making kids and you know making making dinner and you know folding clothes or do I want a someone who's working %HESITATION in which case like about my clothes would suffer my kids who suffer my house which courses suffer you know so I got things like that are very very important to consider couldn't consider wisely and the fireside chats with my friends %HESITATION actually got me to the thing about my life my future life very very very hard 
What is the most important lesson about life you have learned?,supporting lesson that I've learned about life I don't know if it's true or not but I say that you should follow your passion that's what I'm doing myself %HESITATION hopefully I'll eventually reach that goal or at least you know might get fight smiling %HESITATION until my death bed on trying to follow my passion but %HESITATION I guess if I were falling by passing then I would probably be in a nice clean job with a nice car and a nice house in down the street and get an ice cold a sack %HESITATION played for some reason I feel like %HESITATION what I wanna do is I want to own my own business one day or or the one I like me really outstanding his eyes products so %HESITATION because I believe that it feels like my life is worth doing rather than me working for someone else in helping someone else make their dream come true are making the best Pepsi can in the in the world are making the best table on in the world are making like a power for people of points county you know all of those are are honorable profession but it's something that I can come up with is not something that I wanted to do how to do something I want to do and so far I got I'm glad that I'm doing it so that's my suggestion for the people 
What do you think is really important in life?,something that's really poured in life although I I don't really have it in abundance myself it's your connection with other people beat your family did your close friends %HESITATION give your coworkers you should really try to put yourself out there in the world try to become you know part of this world %HESITATION hand that's Andrea theoretical but I like if you live in isolation yes you're you're playing video games yes you know studying all day and all night and %HESITATION if you don't have that much interaction with other people %HESITATION in real life then I think that you're missing out on something that is a really really really critical thinking as well around you know I find yourself %HESITATION smiling a lot more every day and %HESITATION finding finding a better piece %HESITATION when you're when you're you don't have any enemies are out you are looking out for your for your brothers and you sit besides you
