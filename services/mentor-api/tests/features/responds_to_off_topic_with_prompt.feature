        And the response json at $.classifier matches "^lstm_v1/[a-zA-Z0-9\-_]+$"
        
  # for now listing all the PROMPT answers in the regex'es below. Could alternatively test that the answer just isn't garbage, e.g clintanderson_u*
  Examples: Queries
    | mentor    | query                                   | answer_id_regex |
    | carlos    | do you like cookies                     | (carlos_U5[679]_5_1\|carlos_U6[012]_5_1) |
    | clint     | do you like cookies                     | (clintanderson_U4[6-9]_5_1\|clintanderson_U5[01]_5_1\|clintanderson_U7[678]_6_1\|clintanderson_U82_7_1) |
    | dan       | do you like cookies                     | (dandavis_U[6-9]_2_3\|dandavis_U3[5-7]_6_2\|dandavis_U3[89]_6_3) |
    # | julianne  | do you like cookies                   | (julianne_U19_1_3) |
    # julianne classifier seems to never answer OFF_TOPIC. This is a bug, but fix later
