Life is full of trouble and sometimes it turns out you're the one that

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.030
 causes the trouble, and if you get in trouble in the navy they will

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.610
 deal with it fairly and not harshly and they will give you a second

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.200
 chance to make good that depending on the severity of the issue. I

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.790
 for instance was once hauled before the committing officer, for the

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.380
 offensive being more than the allowed number of miles from my duty station

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.970
 on the overnight liberty, that is I was supposed to just stay

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.560
 in town and go drinking and I'd go over to Duke University visit with

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.140
 my younger brother and saw him in that when I go back to camp le

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.730
 June, I had been more than sixty miles from my base on overnight liberty,

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.320
 and so I was but adjuidicated as guilty of that and yet other

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.910
 than a minor fine, which strangely enough I never paid because the company

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.500
 clerk just kind of hid the fine from the pay records, I had no

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.090
 impact at all fofromr that. As you can see it allowed me to get a

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.670
 commission in the navy and rise to the rank of commander. So more serious

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.260
 offenses of course more serious punishment and longer term consequence
