every military organization needs to have a control structure. And we

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.720
 got from historical bases, a class of people considered commissioned

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.650
 officers who seemed Ringling news here you dition intelligence and

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.580
 education that would allow them to be in charge of enlisted people those

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.520
 winds are blowing these days when I was in Vietnam we were very

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.450
 proud of the fact that our intelligence field required higher test

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.380
 scores than the officer candidate school required so those are blurring

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.320
 and so frequently a lot of your technical direction comes from senior

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.250
 NCOs and not from officers but officers are required because their

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.180
 commission by the US government and that commission allows them

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.120
 to do things like administering oaths or citing certain pieces of paper

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.050
 they sign incidently would you become a commissioned officer you

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.980
 swear to a different oaths in the enlisted people so there is a difference

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.920
 between them but not much should be made of that if you're

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.850
 considering a military career
