00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.170
The services work very hard to find just the right job for you, the one

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.480
 of which you are capable and the one which in which you could excel.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.800
 They don't make very many mistakes but they do from time to time

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.110
 make mistakes sometimes. You may not like the work as much as you'd

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.430
 hoped, but usually you can find it challenging and fulfilling. Occasionally

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.740
 you find you can't really do the work for which you were trained.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.060
 When I was in Vietnam we had a man who was trained as a Morse

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.380
 code operator, and he could do it under practice conditions but real

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.690
 conditions it just turned out he wasn't very good at it. So there was

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.010
 no great problem, they just found another job that he could do. They

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.320
 made him the duty teletype operator and he was very good at teletype

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.640
 operations and I can remember him still sitting that teletypewriter

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.960
 just pounding away day and night. You know didn't make mistakes,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.270
 just perfect at it. Sometimes the service can accommodate you that

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.590
 way other times they can find something else for you to do, but by

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.900
 and large I see ninety five percent of guys I knew fit well in the jobs

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.220
 of the military gave them and did well at that and enjoy it when

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.530
 they were done with. The guys I knew who were cryptologists love the

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.850
 work, almost to a man, they loved the work here
