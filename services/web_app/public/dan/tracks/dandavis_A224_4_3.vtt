00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.640
my field almost and I am even bigger anomaly that most people in my field

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.420
 this star on my shoulder boards means that I'm a line officer that

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.210
 means I can command the ship at sea but I'm a cryptologist in my

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.990
 entire career I have never been to see on a naval ship the only times

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.780
 I've been there see is three cruises on civilian cruise liners with

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.560
 my family the average cryptologist will probably spend probably about

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.350
 ten percent of his career on a ship and of that ten percent only

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.140
 five percent total will be spent at sea so cryptologist don't spend

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.920
 a lot of time at sea my little brother on the other hand was sees some

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.710
 marine officer and that basically meant he spent six months out

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.490
 of every year city because he was on the blue crew and the blue crew

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.280
 was out six months and then the whole crew was out so depends on the

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.060
 kind of specially get into in which workers are how much time you

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.850
 spend
