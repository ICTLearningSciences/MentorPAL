The navy pays a lot better than the civilian population thinks about.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.850
 The best way to find out what people are in the navy is you can go to

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.350
 computer online and look up the navy pay scales. But navy pay is comparable

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.850
 to civilian pay in almost every one of their levels of of

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.350
 competence, which means when you first joined up a you're getting a

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.850
 decent living wage and by the time you retire you're making as much

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.350
 as your civilian counterparts are. So like a navy captain is is making

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.850
 you know order a hundred thousand dollars a year.
