00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.490
in both cryptology and in high performance computing research there are

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.120
 never enough good people and sometimes you have to fill billets with

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.760
 people who are not competent to do the work we all know people who

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.400
 got into cryptology who later turned out to have week moral fiber

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.030
 and have caused him measurable harm to the United States in high performance

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.670
 computing in the computing in general we all know people have

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.300
 gone to school and gotten degrees and compare science it cannot program

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.940
 their way out of a paper bag so I think you need to be more people

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.580
 trying to get into both fields both fields are have open opportunities

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.210
 all the time so I think there are far too few people trying

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.850
 to get it all feels
