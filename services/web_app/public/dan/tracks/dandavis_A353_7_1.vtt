00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.290
fortunately the working conditions for cryptologist you're pretty good

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.740
 compared to a lot of people in the service %HESITATION because of the

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.180
 very sophisticated information that we're seeking and the very sophisticated

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.630
 gear that we used to collect that information it does really

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.070
 require the office like setting a requires air conditioning for

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.520
 instance when I was a continent right up on the DMZ in Vietnam %HESITATION

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.960
 we all live in bunkers all the time because we took rockets

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.410
 and mortars constantly %HESITATION but are the cripple IT bunker was

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.850
 the only bunker in the content astonishment that had its own air conditioner

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.290
 and we had the only %HESITATION generator that ran twenty

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.740
 four hours a day so we could keep the air conditioner going and the

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.180
 %HESITATION infantry people thought that was pretty good living fortunately

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.630
 they didn't have to come in our bunker because our bunker was

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.070
 hotter than blazes anyway because most air conditioning was of course

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.520
 not to protect us %HESITATION but to protect the very sincere electronic

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.960
 equipment that we were using at that time largely cryptologist

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.410
 working office like setting %HESITATION was surrounded by like trying

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.850
 to gear and there's kinds of analytic devices
