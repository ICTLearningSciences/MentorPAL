00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.220
all throughout history nations have had to defend themselves against people

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.580
 who wanted their land or their crops or their valuables or sometimes

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.950
 just wanted destroyed what they head for the sheer joy of destroying

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.320
 something somebody else hacer seems to be something in human

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.680
 nature that says if that guy's got something and I can't take it least

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.050
 I can break it up and he can't so there's been a need to defend

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.420
 oneself and generally you do you go to the population and say you've

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.780
 gotta come fight with us the Greek states had such a system the the

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.150
 Romans had small through life and in the nineteenth and twentieth century

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.520
 nation states would say you must serve when the time comes and

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.880
 one of the things they found useful as it's useful to train people

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.250
 before the time you think in the militia and see and the Continental

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.620
 Army or the militias even they end the civil war that mit local people

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.980
 would get together and trained militarily so that there was a need

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.350
 for there to be called up the reserves serve that function today

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.720
 the navy may only have the money for and need five hundred thousand

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.080
 people river the number is this this year enough but they may need

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.450
 twice that many of war breaks out so a lot of people they say well you

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.820
 can go home and be a civilian but will pay you a little to come in

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.180
 and drill on weekends to keep your skills up to date keep your promotions

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.550
 in line learn new skills and things of that nature and then

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.920
 if if there is a need for you to come on active duty will call you and

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.280
 those of the reserves and many reservists volunteer to go back on

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.650
 active duty from time to time for special duty had a friend who really

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.020
 love cryptology and ever so often E. bill it would open up at the

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.380
 national purity agency in for me and if he found out about it he put

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.750
 in port he'd say will recall been active duty for two years now do

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.120
 that job if he if he wound up doing almost an entire career just those

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.480
 two year kinds of duties but that's what the reserve support to

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.850
 go when they're needed
