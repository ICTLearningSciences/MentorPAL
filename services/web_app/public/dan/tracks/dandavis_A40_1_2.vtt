One of the things they really convince you is true in the marine corps

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.160
 and I don't think I've ever met a marine who didn't believe it, was

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.310
 wearing the uniform as a matter of great pride. So the marines put

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.470
 that in me and it's been in me ever since and I've really enjoyed wearing

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.620
 the uniform. But I did have one commanding officer who like to

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.770
 wear the uniform so much that would we'd fly with some place in the

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.930
 reserve for the weekend, when we came back from that trip, he would

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.080
 always make sure we waited till the last minute, so we didn't have

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.230
 changed it a time to change into our civilian clothes before we got

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.390
 on the plane so we always fly home in our summer whites, which your

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.540
 white shoulder boards with the ribbons and everything because he loved

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.700
 to fly wearing uniform. We always got good comments from the people

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.850
 on the plane
