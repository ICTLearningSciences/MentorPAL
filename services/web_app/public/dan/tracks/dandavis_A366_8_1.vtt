00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.480
their number of major life decisions %HESITATION you'll need to make it

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.110
 as you go along in coming out of high school one of the critical decisions

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:11.740
 is %HESITATION some people say I should go into the service

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.380
 in the be in the military for a couple years before I go to college

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.010
 some people say no go to college first then maybe you can get a commission

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.640
 in the military enjoy the military a lot better as a commissioned

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.270
 officer that is listed person but I think it really depends on

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.900
 the person you are I think you need to think very carefully about how

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.530
 mature you are how ready you are to take over your whole life and

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.170
 run things the way they should be run %HESITATION you may be looking

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.800
 forward to the freedom you'll have %HESITATION but you also need to

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.430
 consider the fact that if you are not a very disciplined person that

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.060
 freedom can get you a lot of trouble if you had one of those kinds

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.690
 of people you might think about doing some time in the military and

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.320
 so your wild oats there as you grow up and then go to college if on

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.960
 the other hand years a slam dunk nose to the grindstone I know where

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.590
 I'm going and I know what I what kind of person no reason not to

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.220
 go to college first and then considered military career after but it

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.850
 depends on the person so no yourself before you choose
