I think if you do pursue stammers and educational goal and a career you

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.580
 need to always be open to the other things in life recreation physical

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.940
 fitness and I don't mean work it out I mean just walking or taking

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.300
 up golf or something get you up and moving around is important it's

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.670
 also important I have a philosophical outlook to enjoy the fine

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.030
 arts to learn how to interface with people to give some consideration

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.400
 to spiritual affairs I'm not advocating religion but I think you need

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.760
 to think where did I come from why am I here no wonder my obligations

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.120
 to anything or anybody and where am I going down here so give

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.490
 yourself some time to consider those things don't trivialize them because

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.850
 they're not stem but enjoy them as best you can
