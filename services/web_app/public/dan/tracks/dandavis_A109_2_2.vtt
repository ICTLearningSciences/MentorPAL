00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.670
 Bradley general Omar Bradley in World War Two when the war was about

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.560
 to overcome him swamp him was pressure he would do calculus to relax

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.460
 there's a guy who's loved calculus so figure out where it is you

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.350
 like to do and figure out the broad area what you like to do I like

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.240
 to be with people I like to talk I like to be alone I'd like to work

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.140
 with numbers you know get that then figure out what field does that

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.030
 what field us at every day not what they show on the movies not what

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.920
 they show in the movies the movies and TV have a caricature of real

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.810
 professions are like, quick example if I say lawyer to you ninety

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.710
 percent of you will think of a guy standing in front of the jury saying,

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.600
 "My friends, my clients are innocent" lawyers spent less than

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.490
 one percent of their time arguing to a jury there was the time they're

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.390
 in offices interviewing people interviewing witnesses or writing

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.280
 documents or doing research in books you know that's a completely different

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.170
 life than what they show on TV so get a hold somebody who does

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.060
 this for a living and ask them what do you do during the week every

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.960
 day you go to work what is your day like and if that's something

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.850
 you enjoy doing then that's the right career feel for you.
