00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.080
I think the most important people to talk to if you're interested during

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.320
 the military are people you can trust who are in the military who'll

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.550
 give you good data. do not take their analysis in the military correctly.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.780
 They will sometimes do you the wrong direction, if they didn't

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.020
 like it you'll be able to perceive that very quickly. If they didn't

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.250
 like it listen to it and think "oh here's what a person who didn't

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.480
 like it will tell you" and try to find somebody who did like it

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.720
 to give you the other side of the story. So this is critical to me,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.950
 don't just go by what one person tells you to talk to several people

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.180
 with several different views. When I was commanding officer of the

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.420
 navy reserve unit occasionally we'd get people want to join our reserve

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.650
 unit, and I generally would try to get them a chance to talk to

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.880
 somebody who really loved it and another one of th guys who really

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.120
 didn't care for it much it was going to get out after he served his

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.350
 tour. That would give the best chance to find out what was really like.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.580
 But listen carefully, intermalize what people say and ask factual

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.820
 questions, well he didn't like it, "what was it like?" "what did you

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.050
 do?" "what you do every day?" "what was that like?" "is that what

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.280
 they did the following day?" You don't try it trying to pin them down

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.520
 because otherwise you get their kind of political opinion about it,

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.750
 rather than how they felt. It's amazing to me how many people I've

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.980
 talked to in the military said I hated my time there. I ask "where

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.220
 were you stationed and what were you duties and what did you do for

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.450
 fun?" And after you talked a little while I've had two or three of

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.680
 them say to me you know now that I think about it I really did have

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.920
 a pretty good time. You know so listen listen critically but talk to

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.150
 everybody, and then go talk to every recruiter you can and listen critically

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.380
 they're trying to talk you into joining their service what

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.620
 what are they saying that you can take with a grain of salt and where

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.850
 they say you can take to the bank
