00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.180
My interest in the military's been with me for my entire life. I came

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.520
 from the family that started out in the military to some degree my father

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.850
 was in World War two when I was born. He was a navy officer and

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.180
 was working with Strangelove PT boat engines, another technical field.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.520
 He was an officer in the in the spotlight core and was procuring

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.850
 PT boat engines. My eldest brother was in the Korean War briefly and

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.180
 my youngest brother did twelve years on submarines as a submarine

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.520
 officer. So there's always been an interest in the military and I can

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.850
 remember early in grade school being interest in reading books about

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.180
 the military. Not serious tones there was an author called Fletcher

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.520
 Pratt who wrote a lot of stories about the military, historical

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.850
 books, not really about the military but aimed at young people
