you know I've asked by people of all ages sometime soon usually by young

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.180
 people did you get to shoot anybody or killing body in the service

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.850
 I think most people who've been in the military find that a rather

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.520
 intrusive question and the people I've known who had to kill somebody

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.180

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.180
 a weapon and anyone and that's true about most of people who

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.850
 were in the military the movies and first person shooter games giving

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.520
 the impression everybody's always shoot everybody all the time just
