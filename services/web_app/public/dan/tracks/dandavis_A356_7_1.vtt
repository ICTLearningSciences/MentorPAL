00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.540
one of the great joys to me about working cryptology is you knew you were

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.230
 doing something useful you knew you saw the product on your desk

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.910
 every day that indicated that you were helping out getting to the goals

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.600
 of the country it's set out for you whatever those goals were and

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.290
 if you read history you will find out that people been doing this

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.970
 for a very very long time %HESITATION World War two was replete of

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.660
 issues that were decided pretty much because of cryptology the battle

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.350
 of midway in the Pacific is a famous one where the solution of the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.040
 Japanese naval codes allowed the American carriers to literally ambush

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.730
 the Japanese characters sinking several of them and %HESITATION

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.410
 keeping in Japan for the use of the noble pilots and mechanics you can

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:09.100
 replace the ship but pilots mechanics take a lifetime to produce

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.790
 and they never could replace them of further sealing the doom of Japan

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.470
 in the Atlantic it was the solution of the German naval codes that

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.160
 allowed us to win the battle landed against the summary wolf packs
