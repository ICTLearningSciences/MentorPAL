00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.330
I think most of us start out working in the field where we would like

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.810
 to think that we're gonna have an opportunity to improve yourselves

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.280
 and it grows human beings and that's a major call all of us. The military

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.760
 really does give you that opportunity and it sets out early on

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.240
 you know the day you enlist they give you and enlistment or a commission

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.720
 you know who the top dogs. They wear a different uniform they

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.200
 have different rank they get paid a different amount of money and you

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.680
 know that if you're gonna do the kinds of things you want to do you've

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.150
 got to get to all those senior ranks so I think I think in the

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.630
 opportunity to grow in those fields almost built into the military people

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.110
 know about it they're able to mentor you about it help and they

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.590
 are able to help you do tha. Civilian life especially academia's not

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.070
 quite so clear cut and it's not so often people will say well if

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.550
 you do this you can do that. For instance, if you go to work for a tenured

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.020
 professor on campus as a secretary the chance that you could

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.500
 ever become a tenured professor is next to zero you know it requires

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.980
 preparation and training you will never had and you can never really

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.460
 get there so the opportunities to grow vary depending on who your

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.940
 bosses and a lot of that's personality driven more than organizationally

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.420
 and I would say there's been a number of bosses I've had academia

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.890
 who really want to see me grow and then there's been a number of

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.370
 bosses who were just well you can if you want to go, but I am not going

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.850
 to go out of my way to make it happen.
