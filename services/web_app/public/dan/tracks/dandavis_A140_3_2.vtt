00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.050
Other than the service, I got virtually no initial training for any of

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.250
 the jobs. I learned what I learned in college I learned what I learned

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.450
 from getting through life and I apply those lessons. A lot of the

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.650
 other training I've done, I've done on my own and I it's stood me

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.850
 in good stead so far. Virtually all the computer programming I know

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.050
 I've learned by buying a book and doing it that way. That was even true

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.250
 in the practice of law to some degree, the biggest case I ever won

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.450
 in the practice of law was a jury trial and I just bought a book

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.650
 on how to try this particular kind of case it was a criminal felony,

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.850
 how to try criminal felonies in a jury trial and I read the book and

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.050
 I did it, and we won. So a very interesting way to get through life.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.250
 Of course most corporations and universities have some kind of introductory

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.450
 training, but they basically speaking they just as soon get

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.650
 hit the ground with your feet running and then you'll be off after

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.850
 the real goals.
