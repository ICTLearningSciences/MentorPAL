00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.770
Every person has to learn to face fears they have, and it's much easier

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.700
 to face those fears if you're with a group of people that you love

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.620
 and who care for you. I was worried like everyone else was, but when

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.540
 the first rounds came in the very first night we got hit, I found

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.470
 that I was in the company of people who were supportive, and I had had

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.390
 the advice of the senior sergeant who said "When you first get hit

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.310
 when there's first incoming, just remember what your job is and focus

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.230
 on I've got to do my job" and I followed that advice and it got

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.160
 me through every event we went through, and I can never tell you that

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.080
 I was abnormally frightened. I was alarmed sometimes but I was never

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.000
 in panic or afraid and and you just gotta get through it because

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.930
 the people around you were getting through it with you and I think that

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.850
 the group means everything in a case like this.
