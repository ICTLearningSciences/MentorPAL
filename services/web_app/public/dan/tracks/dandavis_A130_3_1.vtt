00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.260
You know where things always heard growing up was army food is terrible

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.660
 that people complain about army food all the time. So yeah in the

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.070
 marine corps and I started getting the food the food was great. Jeez,

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.470
 I've really enjoyed the food they fed me. People in boot camp gain

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.880
 weight the food was so good, of course that was put on muscle not fat

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.290
 but it was good and I liked it. Then when I went to Morse code training

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.690
 I went to navy base the food down there was wonderful. I mean

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.100
 was was good and plentiful and healthy and I enjoyed it. And then I

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.510
 went to language school was on a navy base we had good food up there

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.910
 too, and that that was alright. And then I went to my first army base,

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.320
 and the food was... We were in Vietnam and the food was not so

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.730
 hot. And then the first year came and new year's day they give this

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.130
 roast beef and everybody who eat roast beef new year's day in the army

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.540
 Chow got some terrible ill and I ate roast beef and I was sick as

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.940
 I ever been in my life. It was terrible, I mean a whole group of us

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.350
 in my watch section were so sick except the guys who for one reason

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.760
 or other had not eaten the roast beef. But they can be forgiven that

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.160
 was a combat zone, so what do you expect. So then I went to Thailand

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.570
 and because the way the watch section was going, we we usually ate

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.970
 hamburgers in the club or we went downtown Thailand and ate. We didn't

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.380
 eat in mess hall very much. And then everybody in the base start

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.790
 getting sick and they couldn't figure iut what it was, and the CO

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.190
 was going to cancel liberty because he said "you're getting sick from

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.600
 going down and eating Thai food" and somebody pointed out to him "you

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.010
 know the guys who don't eat in the mess hall and the guys who didn't

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.410
 get sick" I didn't get sick and they found out that the mess cook

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.820
 can't overlook the fact that the Thai workers in the scullery had

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.230
 decided that it was too hot in there, but if you turn off the steam

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.630
 valve to the steam sterilizer for me in the room a lot cooler. So with

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.040
 that kind of a lukewarm temperature trying to do the sterilization,

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.440
 people got very ill. So that was another army base so maybe it's

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.850
 just army food, but the other food I had was wonderful
