00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.100
When you're looking at different fields and what the priorities may be

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:13.350
 for people in those fields who might suceed, let me buy for keep my

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:19.600
 analysis into civilian on the one hand and military on the other. world

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.850
 I skin trade in which I work a major priorities bring your natural

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:32.100
 vision segment about the fuel to the problem can also bring an incredibly

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:38.350
 strong background theoretical and and applied mathematics

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.600
 a very good background in computer machinery that is you should be reading

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.850
 all the computer technical magazines regularly to see all the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.100
 machinery is changing and they've been a wide knowledge of operating

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.350
 systems and programming codes because you didn't need to be able to

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.600
 understand immediately what's going to mesh well to create global

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.850
 in the field cryptology the priorities should be a wider understanding

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.100
 of people and history and I think that cryptologist no matter what

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.350
 field of cryptology there and neither why read full luminous tomes

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.600
 on history and sociology and people so that you have some understanding

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.850
 about who the people on the other side are that you're trying to

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:47.100
 analyze and then they have to know your specially field we must have

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.350
 to know the language and the T Branche have to know signals are being

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.600
 emmitted by various groups and then the communications need to

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.850
 know how to intercept people.
