If you're asking me about activities on the ship and what happens on cruises,

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.540
 I have to tell you that I'm the wrong guy to ask. As a cryptologist,

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.390
 a hundred percent of my duty has been from land based cryptologic

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.230
 activities. I've been on about a dozen navy ships in my life

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.080
 but for less than a day in each case, generally visiting the cryptologic

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.930
 units on board to find out how their life is going. So from them

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.770
 what I've learned is life at sea is very busy. Sometimes working so

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.620
 much you have very little time left except for just eating and sleeping

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.470
 and getting your clothes washed and take care yourself than doing

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.310
 some PT. But largely on board a ship a lot of time spent reading,

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.160
 lot of time spent watching DVDs, of course the communications the

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.000
 way they are now, often you can call home, so that's the sort of thing

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.850
 you can do on a ship.
