If you're looking for an internship I think one of the best places to

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.580

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.940
 them if they've got a good list of local internships are available

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.300

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.030
 with them that do a Google search or Yahoo search or whatever search
