00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.880
in my professional life I've had two mentors that really had a great deal

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.910
 of influence on me in the navy shortly after I got commissioned

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.940
 I was working for a gentleman who was our executive officer Lieutenant

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.970
 Commander George lam and he and I went on active duty for training

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.000
 to gather and we were down in Pensacola Florida and we had to go through

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.030
 the main gate for the training center every morning and strange

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.060
 enough that's a gate on which I used to stand guard duty when I was

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.090
 in the listed person but they had civilians there now and the civilians

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.110
 were sloppy and not very attentive and certainly didn't show

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.140
 any snap or involvement of what they re doing so when we got time to

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.170
 leave that particular post they gave us a form to fill out in the form

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.200
 said tell something you've observed here and what you got out of

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.230
 that and what we need to do to make it better and I told the commander

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.260
 lamb I think I should write up the main gate and he turned to me

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.290
 and said then whatever you do do not light up the guys on the main

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.320
 gate because he said if there was a problem you're an officer you should

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.350
 have taken care of it right there if there is a problem you want

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.380
 to have taken care of you should take care of it are there somebody

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.410
 else to clean it up for you that's one thing he said the second thing

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.440
 is be aware that they give you a forum like this and say what happened

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.470
 when you were here beware that that's how they're going to write

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.500
 your fitness report when you go home so I thought all that's good

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.530
 so I wrote a fitness report that said tell you what when I came here

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.560
 I learned all kinds of wonderful stuff and I'm Robert officer for

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.590
 everything I've done and this will stick in my mind for a long time

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.610
 because this is such great training and when my fitness report came

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.640
 back it said instantaneous came in he learned some wonderful stuff

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.670
 and it was great training and had a great influence on his life almost

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.700
 word for word cut and paste off that for so that's the kind of advice

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.730
 he gave me I've had a similar mentor in my technical live Paul

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.760
 the Sina who is now at Argonne national labs also somebody you needed

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.790
 to listen to so that's too good piece of advice from two good guys

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.820
 that I worked for and I hope you get a mentor that give you good advice

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.850
