00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.240
it's difficult to generalize about life in the navy but let me tell you

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.640
 an incident that happened to me that I think is one of my memories

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.030
 of what I think the navy is like and what it should be like while I

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.420
 was working at Martin Marietta I got an opportunity to do an augmentation

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.810
 who are to Naples Italy for three weeks I was a lieutenant commander

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.210
 at that time like lieutenant commanders like a major in the

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.600
 army or the marine corps and I thought this sounds like fun I have no

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.990
 idea what I'll be doing well do it so I I got on a plane and flew

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.390
 to Rome and on my way to Rome I noticed a lot of other people short

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.780
 haircuts and they kind of carried themselves like navy people you off

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.170
 right athletic you don't fit and I said well it's interesting start

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.560
 talking to I'm sure enough they were reservists and they were going

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.960
 to Naples and I got to talk to him and there were some enlisted people

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.350
 a couple officers so it's fun and when we got to Naples we'll report

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.740
 and then it turned out there about Sergio and as luck would have

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.140
 it or bad luck I have in my mind I was the senior officer so I was

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.530
 in charge and there was a a fairly mature chief petty officer there

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.920
 who was a senior chief which is in a a purchase the next the highest

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.310
 rank you can get in the military E. nine in the in the navy is senior

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.710
 I a master chief but this guy was a senior chief so I had four

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.100
 officers the senior chief and everybody else was in most so what was

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.490
 I got I was in charge was I going to do so I knew we were supposed

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.890
 to help these people with their watch standing that is we go in and

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.280
 do our cryptologic duties twenty four hours a day and so we had so I

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.670
 turned to my senior chief I said senior chief you break the enlisted

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.060
 people into four what sections for you know you need three to cover

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.460
 every day and then you need to aim one to cover that because the weekend

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.850
 times too so for what section and I'll be for the officers so

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.240
 I got together with the officers and I said what we're in Italy for

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.640
 the one time in our life for over here to do some hard work but here's

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.030
 what I'm proposing I'm gonna tell the watch sections will set up

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.420
 a watch schedule so that people are working their butts off for a couple

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.810
 of days and then when they get their break they'll get a four

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.210
 or five D. break was known to you all so they can make it up to Venice

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.600
 you go up to Romer go down this is or just go around Naples for five

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.990
 days and enjoy their of Rome and there wasn't that that's a great

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.390
 idea so we got that all set up we got each each officer was in charge

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.780
 of one watch section and he would be in charge of up on the on the

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.170
 order of six or seven people some of whom were linguist but most

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.560
 were electronic warfare specialist or collection specialist or communicators

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.960
 and he would he would make sure they did their job on their

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.350
 watch section and he would help out with put officers did it during

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.740
 the watch which is help writing reports and keeping track what was

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.140
 going on and I was a senior guy so I did a lot of the a briefings to

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.530
 the senior people every briefed us navy of British navy captain and

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.920
 that was that was fun in the senior chief ally star right away right

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.310
 away writing fitness reports for the officers and enlisted evolves

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.710
 because at the end of the three weeks had to turn in what everybody

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.100
 done when they did a good job or not and I didn't want the local commander

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.490
 have to do that so we started doing it together so the senior

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.890
 chief and I did that the troops loved it everybody had a good time

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.280
 there but he did a good job and the active duty personnel who were

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.670
 there helping simply the best group that if we ever see and we never

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.060
 met each other before we got together we were in the navy common goal

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.460
 we know what we're doing we did a lot that's what the navy's all
