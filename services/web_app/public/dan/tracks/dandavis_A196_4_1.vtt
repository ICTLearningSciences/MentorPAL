one of times when you're working in stem you're giving a specific task

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.180
 to do yet you might be given of subroutine of code to write and you

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.350
 have to do that but the thing that is important in any kind of stem

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.520
 activity you have to be alert for opportunities you have to be open

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.680
 to changes in the do you see something that's abnormal if you discover

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.850
 something that's not available to everybody else and one example

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.020
 I know of is when I was reading high performance computing at Caltech

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.180
 a bunch of guys quit the high performance computing center and started

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.350
 a new company that was going to write pro code for big parallel

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.520
 computers and to do that writing of the code they had to develop a

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.680
 new performance tool so they developed a little piece of software that

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.850
 measured the performance of high performance computers and they

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.020
 sold millions of dollars worth of that little performance to and they

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.180
 never did get to do any programming they want to do because they were

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.350
 so busy selling all that code so they had to be alert for the fact

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.520
 that they're doing programming for high performance computers wasn't

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.680
 and remitted feel the writing little tool for terrific so got to

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.850
 keep your mind open
