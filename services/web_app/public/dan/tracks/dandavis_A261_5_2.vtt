00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.270
it's certainly not always true about people in the military but the work

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.690
 I did the military was very transferable to the civilian sector even

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.110
 though my ultimate specially was Hanoi dialect Vietnamese linguist

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.530
 it wasn't crypto linguistics which means I probably could have gone

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.960
 to an essay and got the job as a civilian anytime I wanted plus a

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.380
 **** like clearances I'd picked up in the military very transferable

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.800
 when it got me the number of jobs in fact got me two jobs at least

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.220
 because I had those five global clearances already my basic skills

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.640
 and team Morse code operator probably wouldn't have much transfer ability

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.060
 but my general skills in electronic certainly would have been

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.480
 sellable so I think my skills were very transferable plus the fact in

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.900
 the marine corps fewer of them sixty machine gun or rifle and before

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.320
 they let you out of the car they gave you about the three month period

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.740
 where they would train you in the civilian school called project

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.170
 transition yeah I made use of that probably shouldn't have but I

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.590
 did anyway because it was fun by working in the base photo lab for several

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.010
 months before I got discharged learning all about photography

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.430
 so one way or the other you come out of the military with very transferable

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.850
 skills
