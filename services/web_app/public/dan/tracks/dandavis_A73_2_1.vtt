00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.050
When I was in the Marine Corps boot camp, they came and got at a line

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.250
 one day and said you've got to go over to this other building and talk

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.450
 to this guy who we don't even know who he is but he's from the government

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.650
 wants to talk to you. And when they came back from that the

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.850
 guy asks me all kinds of questions about whether I was clearable and

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.050
 criminal record everything in my life that was embarassing. And I

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.250
 thought, well that's really strange was going on there. And when the

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.450
 workers came out our platoon commander which was an E seven gunnery

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.650
 sergeant in the Marine Corps read out orders he read out my orders

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.850
 I was ordered to school to learn twenty five seventy one divys and our

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.050
 platoon commander as an E seve, his major job in the Marine Corp

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.250
 was communications. So he'd hanedle the radios between different units

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.450
 in the Marine Corps and he got me aside and he said you're going

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.650
 to love this duty. And little did I know how much I really was going

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.850
 to love it. When I finally get to the good lord and can talk to him,

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.050
 I will say thank you lord putting me in that line of work. I loved

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.250
 every every every second of it. It was so exciting, was so intellectually

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.450
 challenging was, so much fun. And then I got out in civilian

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.650
 life, stayed with cryptology in the reserves. Lived out civilian life

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.850
 and bungered around out, I was a lawyer for ten years with my dad

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.050
 until he died. But I didn't like that very much. But I got back into

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.250
 computer research and again I felt something I'm really really loved.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.450
 So I love computing. I love working on computers. I love envisioning

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.650
 what you can do with a computer. Something a lot of people don't

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.850
 have his vision they can do what they're told that they can't see.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.050
 Wow, we could do this for that you know and so one of things I really

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.250
 love my job in academia is you're given an opportunity to talk about

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.450
 your vision, sell your vision and work on your vision, so those are

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.650
 all things I really love about both my military and my civilian careers.
