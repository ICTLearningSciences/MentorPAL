00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.290
well brother who is getting ready to get out of high school in Colorado

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.730
 springs he wanted over should go to college he was a very very bright

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.160
 young man very smart so I thought what he can get into some really

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.600
 good colleges unfortunately my parents couldn't afford to send into

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.040
 the good private colleges and he didn't particularly want to get

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.470
 a whole lot of student data I enjoy the military so much I talked to

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.910
 him and I said why don't you apply to a really good school and see

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.350
 if they've got a naval ROTC program because the navy will pay for your

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.790
 education and give you some spending money on the side so he went

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.230
 and applied for naval ROTC scholarship at Duke University in North

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.660
 Carolina I do because frequently rated it's amongst the top ten schools

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.100
 in the country so that was a very good way for him to get good training

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.540
 and he was in the navy for twelve years and probably would still

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.970
 be in the navy but his wife told would you go to see one more time

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.410
 and I won't be here when you come home so we got all the navy got

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.850
 a PhD and went to work for IBM
