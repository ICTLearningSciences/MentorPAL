00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.080
When I was in the military got a chance to go overseas quite a bit. I

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.300
 did a year in Vietnam. And during that year in Vietnam I was given the

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.530
 opportunity to do two R and Rs. Rest and relaxation, and those were

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.760
 one week tours, one to Australia and one to Japan. Then when I went

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.990
 back to the states almost immediately I was given opportunity doing

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.210
 augmentation tour to help out the army linguist who were stationed

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.440
 in northern Thailand a place called Udorn Tanay, just south of Vientiane

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.670
 Laos. And so I was put on a plane and we flew to Taiwan, and

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.900
 we flew from Taiwan to Hong Kong, and we flew from Hong Kong to Bangkok,

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.120
 spent a couple days in Bangkok, and then flew up country to Udorn

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.350
 Tanay, where I spent three months and spent quite a bit of time out

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.580
 on the economy, that is traveling around locally in Thailand. And

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.800
 one day we got a special opportunity to go up to the Mekong river and

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.030
 sail up and down the Mekong river on one of the motor boats run up

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.260
 and down the Mekong. When they got in the reserves most of my duty

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.490
 was stateside but I had six tours overseas. One of those tours was

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.710
 Naples Italy where I spent almost three weeks doing augmentation tour.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.940
 I spent two weeks in London, I did another two weeks in London and

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.170
 then spent three tours in northern Japan, Northen Honshu in Japan

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.400
 at a place called Misawa. So I've been overseas quite a bit, also spent

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.620
 about a week in Okinawa coming and going to Vietnam. Have not been

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.850
 station other than that overseas
