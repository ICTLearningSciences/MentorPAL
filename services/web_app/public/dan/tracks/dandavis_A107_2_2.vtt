The importance of resumes so often discussed and I'm not so sure that

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.200
 it is that critical frequently people analyze resumes and try to say

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.380
 you should emphasizes this deemphasize that, but I think once you get

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.560
 the basics down make sure you list all of your qualifications what

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.730
 your record is, everything is provable and you can stand by it think

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.910
 that's about what you wanna do you wanna may spend some time on a

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.090
 cover letter that goes with the resume but by and large I think you

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.260
 know people are not looking for something on a resume that will select

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.440
 you they're looking for is a lack of something on a resume that'll

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.610
 keep you from getting selected and that's things like we need a guy

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.790
 with a bachelors degree and this guy doesn't have a bachelors degree

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.970
 so as long as you can meet the qualifications are looking for and

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.140
 I think the quality of school you went to make a lot of difference

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.320
 if you get an opportunity to publish a paper was somebody make sure

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.500
 you do that and then you have that put on your resume as well I published

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.670
 A, B, and C article and such and such a journal and that looks

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.850
 good.
