00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.610
There are a number of educational possibilities in the military and let's

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.380
 take these kind of from the ground up. The first is while you're

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.140
 on active duty you can apply for, if you're so inclined or qualified,

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.910
 the Naval Academy. You can apply to get support to get a degree in

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.670
 their number ways that they will support getting associates degree

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.440
 or a bachelor's degree. But if you already have a bachelor's degree,

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.200
 officers can apply to go to the naval postgraduate school and get

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.970
 an advanced degree there. There some officers allowed to go to school

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.730
 and college and and get a PhD for a few years. Those are all possibilities

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.500
 while you're in the service after you get out of the service

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.260
 you got the GI bill and those benefits change from time to time, so

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.030
 the best thing there is to double check with your recruiter, what

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.790
 they're currently offering you, how it works. My father went to law

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.560
 school on the GI bill I went to undergrad, finished up my undergraduate,

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.320
 and then went on to law on the GI bill. So that was mine, was different

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.090
 than his was and yours will be different than mine was so check

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.850
 with your recruiter how it is today.
