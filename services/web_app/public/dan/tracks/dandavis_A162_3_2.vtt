00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.850
I don't exactly know what that question means good feedback from what

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 from how good the food was at McDonald's today and one of the most important

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.850
 things in the military and civilian life is to understand what

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 it is you're trying to achieve and once you understand what it is

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.850
 you're trying to achieve your second obligation is how do I get people

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.850
 would tell me how well I'm doing how old do I get people to come

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 up to me and say you could get where you're trying to go better if

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 you did this rather than that you know you need constructive feedback

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.850
 both from below him from above and people are disinclined to give

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.850
 you feedback we're trained early in life not to be particularly mean

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.850
 to people a year we should criticize people may feel bad you know

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 if you ever have a choice between being right to be kind be kind and

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.850
 all those things are true but sometimes if you really want somebody

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.850
 to help you out so one of the ways you wanted make sure you get good

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.850
 feedback is make sure you let the people you're seeing the beat feedback

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.850
 from know that when they give you feedback here to listen and

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.850
 you do not feel bad about them because he giving you feedback there

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.850
 are far too many of us to say what I'm doing wrong and the minute you

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.850
 say well then you know you spend too much time combing your hair

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.850
 you know and the air left and I say what I of in the next time you asking

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.850
 for feedback they say and I've seen that happen seen it plenty

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.850
 in both military and so devilishly goals know what it is you're trying

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.850
 to do and then ask people from and accept the feedback without some

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.850
 and back at them either your boss or the people
