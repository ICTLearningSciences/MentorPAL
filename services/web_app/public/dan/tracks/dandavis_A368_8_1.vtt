00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.780
I currently live in the the apartment house in building that does not

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.720
 allow pets of any kind so I have no pets at this time but during my

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.650
 life I've owned two dogs of both schnauzers in many states both miniature

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.580

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.120
 of them is virtually all of them had owned a dog for which they were

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.050
 personally responsible when they were growing up so I would recommend

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.980
 having a dog and I would recommend if you have children and still

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.920
 have a dog and make him responsible for feeding and watering and
