00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.410
When you enlist in the military you're basically signing a contract saying

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.960
 you agreed to do something and you agree to it for a period of

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.520
 time, usually a number of years at least. Once you've signed that a

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.070
 your legally and morally and ethically in my mind, obligated to commit

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.630
 to that contract and finish it up. But what happens if you have a

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.180
 severe set of circumstances that have changed? If your health fails,

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.740
 or if your family has a dire need your the only surviving son for

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.290
 parents who cannot take care of themselves or something a nature. There

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.850
 are rare occasions when the military will allow you an early out

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.410
 to take care of those kinds of issues, but by and large I think you

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.960
 should never go into any contract with the intention of quitting it.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.520
 And that's certainly goes for the military, because leaving the military

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.070
 in the lurch, you know if there is a missing person on the firing

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.630
 line, that means the remainder of us on the firing line or put

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.180
 in danger. So the military takes a very serious view of that contract

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.740
 so you really should not go the military with the idea of "oh I'll

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.290
 try it a couple of months then go out". So it's very hard to quit the

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.850
 military
