it feels it could tell G. change as the fields in cryptology change as

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.710
 the years go on %HESITATION some of the fields that were quite common

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.140
 back when I was in cryptology have been transferred to other areas

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.560
 %HESITATION some of the fields have been %HESITATION kind of obviated

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.990
 because the change in technology %HESITATION for instance one of

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.420
 the largest areas that would strain when I was on active duty back

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.850
 in the sixties and seventies I was worse code %HESITATION because a

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.280
 lot of nations still use Morse code %HESITATION to transmit their official

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.710
 information back and forth so I think that's virtually been obviated

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.140
 these days and so but the people used to do more scope collection

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.560
 now spend more time doing other kinds of singles collection but

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.990
 that is a general group of group that does singles collection for

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.420
 communications then there's a group that collects analyzes identifies

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.850
 and the rights of the missions that are not communications oriented

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.280
 electronic warfare people %HESITATION they want to know what are the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.710
 characteristics of any kind of machine within minutes or twenty %HESITATION

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.140
 waves and that that could be radars could be %HESITATION

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.560
 telemetry for rockets %HESITATION could be any number of %HESITATION

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.990
 other kinds of of emissions %HESITATION that allow you to identify

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.420
 and the platform and the source of those emissions and what that could

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.850
 tell you about what's going on the other side
