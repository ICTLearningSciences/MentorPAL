00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.240
when you talk about picking your career or a major in school there are

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.630
 number of things that you need to consider and be very rational about

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.020
 %HESITATION but I think it's important not to get too obsessive about

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.410
 it because I've known many people in life who were absolutely certain

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.790
 what they're gonna do with their life and it turned out to be

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.180
 not at all but they wound up doing and they're very happy with where

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.570
 they wound up in the known people who wander through life just taking

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.960
 life as it came and they did pretty well too a but I think the most

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.350
 important thing about life is to know who you are and what you're

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.740
 good at because I think you can get into some real misery if you pick

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:00.130
 a profession that does not make good use of your skills as a profession

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.520
 the demands of you skills you don't have %HESITATION so I think

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.910
 %HESITATION I can't think of anything somebody should have told

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.290
 me other than I wish someone had told me early on in my career %HESITATION

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.680
 Sedona make a list of things you're good at and I think you're

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.070
 not good at and avoid all careers that require you to do things you're

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.460
 not good at and don't make good use of the things for which you

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.850
 are well suited
