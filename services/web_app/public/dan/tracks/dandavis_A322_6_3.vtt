00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.730
as far as studying abroad goes you've got a generation gap problem when

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.610
 I was in college and in graduate school very few students went to

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.500
 study abroad it was not comedy when my girls went to school they all

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.380
 said no Daddy after you study abroad for you which is sorry by me because

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.260
 usually study abroad in costing more than going to the college

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.140
 in each case in my case it was a public school over the girls were

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.030
 going public university so that'd make it and so I didn't do that but

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.910
 is still major that's really a tough one them you know people from

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.790
 arts and letters tend to be lesson driven in terms of straight where

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.670
 is that people who are in engineering for instance in the hard sciences

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.560
 frequently have so many courses they have to take their Havel

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.440
 hold one wiggle room and so spinning year abroad is going to give you

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.320
 some kind of interfacial friction that will lose you some hours so

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.200
 I'm I'm not sure that it's it's the right thing to do on the other

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.090
 hand my daughters all loved it and said they learned a lot about life

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.970
 doing it so I think it's pretty much individual choice sorry can't

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.850
 help you more than that
