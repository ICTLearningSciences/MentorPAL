The marine corps has a tradition that every member of the chorus is an

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.290
 infantryman of heart so I carried an M 60 machine gun head to my duty

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.520
 station, and when we got called to the trench lines if we thought

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.740
 we might get attacked my job was to get my machine gun and my ammunition

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.960
 and be ready to repel the attack. That never happened while I

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.180
 was there, but I had other duties, such as manning the outside perimeter

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.410
 where a sergeant of the guard from time to time, or building up

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.630
 our defenses by digging trenches and new bunkers and the like. But

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.850
 basically my time in Vietnam was spent doing my cryptologic duties
