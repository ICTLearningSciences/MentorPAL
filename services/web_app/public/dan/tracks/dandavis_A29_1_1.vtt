A typical day for a cryptologist is to spend eight hours of that day on

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.620
 what they call watch, which means your duty station would be to go

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.000
 into your office or your facility or your bunker and you would have

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.390
 some duties of analyzing data that you had received in producing reports.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.770
 You would do that for eight hours without break, if you needed

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.160
 to have food the food would be brought to you on station and then

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.540
 at the end of that eight hours you would have typically sixteen hours

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.930
 off. But in most combat or other kinds of emergency situations you

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.310
 would work up to twelve hours a day doing your technical job. When

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.700
 your state side, your duty would probably be like four to six hours

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.080
 today with a lot of off time a lot of slack time to make up for the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.470
 extra time we had to put in when you were in a combat situation or deployed

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.850
 overseas
