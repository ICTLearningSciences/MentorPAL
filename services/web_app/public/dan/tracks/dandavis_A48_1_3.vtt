00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.560
My time in the marine corps and the navy were the best times of my life

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.260
 and I do miss being in the navy and being able to do it all over again.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.970
 I recently got a chance to go to a boot camp graduation down in

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.670
 San Diego with one of my best volleyball playing buddies from my service,

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.380
 the warrant officer Sam Werner. And as we watched the young

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.090
 recruits being briefed before they took off on their careers, both of

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.790
 us were absolutely overcome by such emotions and such yearning to

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.500
 be part of that again and be part of the adventure and part of the excitement.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.200
 So yes I do miss it I miss virtually every part of it. But

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.910
 one of the good things about the service is my marine corps friends

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.610
 from Vietnam and language school, and all of my navy buddies from

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.320
 twenty plus years of cryptologic service all correspond with me consistently

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.030
 online. I get an email from an old veteran buddy two or three

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.730
 times a day, sometimes just a joke they like your something but sometimes

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.440
 the a deep discussion about a problem they're facing or just

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.140
 check in on how I'm doing. So yes I do miss it but to a large degree

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.850
 it came with me.
