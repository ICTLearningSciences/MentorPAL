00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.650
You have it luckier than I did. When I enlisted in the marine corps, the

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.450
 pay scales were sacrificial. These were in the days of the draft

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.250
 so there were plenty of people who were low ranking enlisted people

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.050
 that can be gotten you know by order of the president United States

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.850
 they just drafted them, so I think my first pay back in sixty seven

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.650
 was about sixty dollars a month, and if you took into account inflation,

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.450
 that would probably be about to two hundred and forty to four hundred

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.250
 dollars a month today. So it is pretty low, but it was was plenty,

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.050
 who was plenty you lived in the barracks. You drank beer for a

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.850
 quarter at the club and you didn't have it in a car virtually no one

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.650
 of the barracks had a car. These days the official pay is much better

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.450
 than that and I would urge you to go online and just type in military

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.250
 pay scales and the current pay scale come up in front of you and

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.050
 show you how much you get paid. So it's a little over an you first

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.850
 start out as an E1 but you get promoted up to E3 very fast, And E4

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.650
 probably within a year or so. So then then you start getting a little

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.450
 better, and by the time you get in the senior ranks it pays comparable

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.250
 to civilian life in a lot of ways and the same with officers.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.050
 A captain in the navy or a colonel in the airforce marine corps or army

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.850
 make the kind of money that the manager at that level would be getting

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.650
 an industry. And the entire package is pretty good because you

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.450
 not only get pay, but if you live off base they give you housing loans

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.250
 which is non taxed and so I the pay is not bad and when you go

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.050
 on base these days virtually everybody even the brand new enlisted people

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.850
 have a car or motorcycle or both, so pay's pretty good.
