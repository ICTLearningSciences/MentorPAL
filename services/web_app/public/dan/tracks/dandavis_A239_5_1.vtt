00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.540
when considering a career field I think it's important that you consider

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.230
 the various aspects of that field because in almost every major stem

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.910
 the field there are thousands of different positions you can take

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.600
 you know we ended those or even broken down further so the broader

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.290
 your education is in those fields the more you'll get a sense of we'll

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.970
 hear a number of opportunities I might do this rather than that

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.660
 I might become but visualizing the expert in data analysis rather than

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.350
 a programmer in transaction processing for credit card come so you

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.040
 want to get a feel for both of those while you're in school so I think

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.730
 that it's not a specific course I'd recommend is justice approach

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.410
 of sample everything as you go along and it and give it a shot is

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.100
 always going and destroy your GP eight because you just incapable of

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.790
 doing the work give it a shot in the NC with them it rings a bell

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.470
 with you or at least put that your data banks because it might not interest

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.160
 you now but ten years you know you'll be a different person

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.850
 you might want to reconsider
