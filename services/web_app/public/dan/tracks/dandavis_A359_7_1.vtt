00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.130
one of the things I can really guarantee you is if you go in the service

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:13.410
 and learn from your experience there I mean keep your mind open to

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.680
 what what does this teach me about maybe about other people about

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.960
 working with people about what I can do what I can't do you know whether

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:32.240
 my limits of what limits today I think I had that I really didn't

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:38.520
 have I think you come out of the service much better off I certainly

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.790
 feel like I've learned that %HESITATION from my experience in the

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:51.070
 service %HESITATION you you learn things that you just cannot imagine

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.350
 you're going to you're being able to do before you got into the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.630
 service and you learn eight you gotta get over personal differences

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.910
 you gotta get over %HESITATION just you know take it and %HESITATION

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:16.180
 hold a grudge against somebody for instance you don't have time for

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.460
 that you're too busy doing your job to do that which got to do is take

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.740
 care of each other %HESITATION the one on each other never let your

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.020
 team down if you can possibly do it and I think that just comes

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.290
 across very well is certainly has for me later on as well as the community

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.570
 tends to recognize here's a guy who did well the service he's

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.850
 got something to offer
