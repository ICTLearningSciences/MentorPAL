00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.020
When I enlisted the draft was still once there was no bonus from enlisting.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.180
 I was not at all volunteer service, the bonusprogram started after

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.350
 that, so I don't have very good knowledge of how the bond system

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.520
 worked. I did not get one and I did not reenlist so there was no reenlistment

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.680
 bonus, they were more common even back then, you get a reenlistment

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.850
 bonus sometimes
