When you're looking at people in your life you admire they seem to fall

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.550
 into a number of different classes, people who are historical figures

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.900
 who live in the past, people who are living today of, people who

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.250
 you know only through the newsreels, and people you know personal.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.600
 So it's hard to come down with a single person that I can say I admire

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.950
 them the most. My previous boss at USC was a person I admire greatly,

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.300
 he was a very thoughtful and very pragmatic academic, he was not

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.650
 an ivory tower guy he understood how the world really worked. He was

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.000
 brilliant and came from a professorial family and had a lot of achievement

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.350
 in high performance computing, I had a tremendous amount of

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.700
 admiration for him. He was also professional quality of baseball players

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.050
 until his arm gave out as a pitcher, super guy nice guy fun to

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.400
 be with new every topic you want to talk. Outside of that in cryptology

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.750
 I guess I have to say one of my heroes was Joe Rochefort historically

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.100
 he's the man who was in Honolulu and helped break the Japanese

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.450
 codes in World War two. In academia, one of my favorite people was

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.800
 my first boss at Caltech, Doctor Paul Messina he's now at Argonne

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.150
 National Laboratories a very intelligent fellow born in Sicily raised

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.500
 his Panama and educated in United States always fun to be with a gentleman

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.850
 of the first order I appreciate gentility as well.
