00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.730
One of the most critical features of military life is enforced separation

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.610
 from your loved ones, your family, and your friends. This is not

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.500
 too bad in this day and age, you need to remember that back in the

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.380
 early part of the eighteenth century, New England whalers would leave

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.260
 on equal shifts and be gone for two two and a half years was no communication

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.140
 all to their spouse or their parents, or the siblings or

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.030
 their friends. And then they would come back for a short period time

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.910
 and then got another ship and take off again. You don't see that kind

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.790
 of separation, but there will be some separation. For instance when

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.670
 you're in boot camp typically speaking you will not be allowed to

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.560
 communicate other than by letter to anybody outside of yor boot camp

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.440
 group, your platoon, or flight or batallion, or whatever that they

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.320
 call it in your service. So the advice I think you should give your

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.200
 your family is "I will be going I will appreciate any way you can

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.090
 communicate with me, I would still be part of your life, so keep me

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.970
 up on what's going on, and know that I'm thinking of you and I'll try

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.850
 to communicate with you whenever I get a chance."
