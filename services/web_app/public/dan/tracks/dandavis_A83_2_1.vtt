00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.780
When you're talking about different fields it's kind of hard to say what

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.700
 my field is exactly because I've done high performance computing

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.630
 research. So is it research my field or is high performance computing

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.550
 my field or is academia my field. So let me just speak generally about

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.480
 that in the same might be said about cryptology. I will see cryptologic

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.410
 linguist other people were Morse code operators other people

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.330
 were electronics experts other people studied radars in the walk so

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.260
 there are all kinds of different cryptologist but I think the the

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.180
 the civilian field I have which is high performance computing what is

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.110
 unique about it is we're always on the cutting edge because high performance

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.040
 computing doesn't say this is a high performance computer.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.960
 It's kind of a loose definition high performance computer is the most

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.890
 powerful kind you have now is that the vector computer like the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.810
 crates or is it like the Intel delta parallel computer or is it an accelerated

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.740
 computer using GPGUs general purpose graphics processing

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.660
 unit co-processers or is it one of the new quantum computers like we

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.590
 have here at USC. All those are high performance computers and so that's

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.520
 a unique part of that is it's a loose definition with a lot of

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.440
 different technologies it's always exciting always new and always on

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.370
 the cutting edge which means you got ten people said this is great

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.290
 to get the overall you got a hundred people over here saying well oh

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.220
 gosh not another set of empty promises you didn't deliver it last

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.150
 time and just go crazy about it. Cryptology thing that's unique about

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.070
 it is the most intellectual I think of all of the intelligence community.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.000
 The intellectual focus and the intellectual skills of the owner

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.920
 and the intellectual ascendancy that the US has in this area are

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.850
 just wonderful things to behold.
