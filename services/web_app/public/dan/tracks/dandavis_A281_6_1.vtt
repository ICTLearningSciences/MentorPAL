00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.320
my best friend in the navy is a concept I find hard to conceive I had

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.780
 so many best friends in the navy it would take me a year to recite them

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.250
 all to you and tell a war story about everyone of them they're all

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.720
 wonderful guys but let me just pick one that probably wouldn't on

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.180
 more active duties with anything else in the navy anyway and that was

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.650
 where officer Sam Werner where I lost your Werner was nearly as tall

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.120
 as I am I'm six six and he's probably six three six four and he

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.580
 and I'm really good volleyball players and if we went on active duty

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.050
 and there was a volleyball match we get involved and we were dating

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.520
 good we were particularly good at being middle blockers he was a brilliant

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.980
 guy he worked at NORAD into civilian life a wonderful cryptologic

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.450
 technician and a wonderful wonderful Morse code operator he can

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.920
 take code like crazy but Sam where there was a really good friend

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.380
 of mine still is but we don't see each other much anymore because he

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.850
 lives in Texas
