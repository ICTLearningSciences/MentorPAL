00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.770
all the stem fields in general are good fields into which you should sooner

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.680
 going they are all honorable professions they're all very well

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.600
 paid they're all fairly stable in employment and they're all almost

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.520
 all of them then involved very good working condition so all the stem

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.430
 fields are good ones to go into picking the best one has to be an

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.350
 individual choice most of them have a pretty good future in terms of

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.270
 people need they're gonna we need more and more people in stem because

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.180
 stem does require some ability in math and science than a lot of

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.100
 people don't have and can't choir but within those fields you have

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.020
 to decide theoretical physicist made love what he's doing but a person

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.930
 who's a natural born I'm Peter programmer might not like at work

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.850
 at all and vice versa
