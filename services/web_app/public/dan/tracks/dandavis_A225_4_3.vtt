I did not list in the naval services until I was twenty three years old

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.350
 so I did not have the kind of home sickness that young people get

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.600
 sometimes best year my life is my year in Vietnam when we didn't have

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.850
 any contact at all except for written letters back and forth to our

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.100
 family I have always enjoyed the excitement of being in the service

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.350
 and doing that interesting exciting and vital work so I've never felt

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.600
 homesick a certain desire to go back home I've always been happiest

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.850
 when I'm doing what I enjoy doing and usually I was in a situation

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.100
 where I want to keep doing it we did a ninety day TD why that is

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.350
 temporary duty in Thailand as a group of language to assisting the army

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.600
 security agency upcountry and Thailand up near the Mekong river

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.850
 in Thailand and after we done the ninety days another sergeant and I

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.100
 went and asked the people who were in charge can't you keep is another

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.350
 ninety days we'd like to spend at least three more months going

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.600
 hungry doing it was such fun work and best of all Heineken beer was

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.850
 only twenty five cents a mile
