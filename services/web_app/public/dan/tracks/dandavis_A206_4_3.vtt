when you look back at what your life after a time you usually can find

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.470
 things that you regret and there are many in my mind's eye and times

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.770
 I said things I shouldn't have made choices I should have made but

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.080
 one of the things I didn't do that I'd looking back I should have done

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.390
 is there a number of times in my life when I had an opportunity

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.700
 to advance my education in ways that would have cost me nothing other

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.000
 than the effort and I passed them up when I was at Caltech I could

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.310
 have gotten another degree when I was at the university of southern

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.620
 California I could have gotten another to when I was in mark Marietta

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.930
 they would have paid me get another degree and you say well you've

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.230
 got a bachelors degree in a law degree what else would you know there's

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.540
 always something to learn only something that would be fun to

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.850
 do and and I really wish I'd taken more coursework on the head
