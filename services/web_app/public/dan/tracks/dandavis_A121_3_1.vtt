00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.280
Many people in life choose a career early in their life my oldest brother

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.710
 in high school decided that he wanted to be a veterinarian and have

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.140
 a large animal veterinary practice in the small town in the rocky

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.560
 mountain west. He grew up in Illinois went to university of Illinois

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.990
 got a degree in chemistry, then got admitted to veterinary medical

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.420
 school which in Illinois is harder to get into the medical school

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.850
 is and got a DVM and became a veterinarian moved we will Wyoming and

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.280
 lasted exactly five and a half years. He hated it, he couldn't do it

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.710
 he was there that he was a wonderful veterinarian but he wasn't good

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.140
 at the the personal part of being a veterinarian. So he left that

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.560
 and went to work for a number of large organizations that were doing

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.990
 research and he wound up not only doing research, but he finally wound

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.420
 up living on the east river in New York City working for two different

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.850
 large firms- Pfizer and Ciba - doing drug registration internationally.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.280
 So when the new drug was produced by one of those firms

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.710
 for veterinary use, he would go to these foreign countries and figure

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.140
 out how to get the license so it can be sold there. So basically what

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.560
 he wound up doing was something was more legal work than veterinary

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.990
 medical work. How did I choose my career, unlike my oldest brother

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.420
 I just kind of waltzed into it I got picked for cryptology by the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.850
 marine corps and loved it. I practiced law with my dad for a few years

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.280
 did like that very much. Went back to academia and I've loved it

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.710
 in academia. And I'm in academia largely because the navy reserve buddy

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.140
 of mine no what have you once said what it's going to work for

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.560
 us it might merit in doing research and that's where I got started with

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.990
 Martin Marietta and then I got hired by Caltech, fom mark Marietta.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.420
 So sometimes life just takes care of you and it certainly took care

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.850
 of me
