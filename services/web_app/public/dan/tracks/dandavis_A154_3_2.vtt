It'd be interesting find out what the number one reason we believe in

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.100
 the marine corps navy is. Within my experience, most people left the

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.730
 navy and the marine corps simply because they had goals. I wanted to

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.350
 pursue family life professional goals there were not supported by

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.970
 the active duty military. Now a lot of people like I did, enjoy the

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.600
 military and found it desirable not only to pursue my civilian pursuits,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.230
 but to get in the reserve so I can still be part of the military

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.850
 and military life. It certainly has worked out well for me
