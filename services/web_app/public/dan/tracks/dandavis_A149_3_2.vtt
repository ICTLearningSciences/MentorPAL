00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.570
Deployments, and getting called up as a reservist and seeing the active

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.300
 duty in a combat zone are all at of the behest of the national security

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.020
 apparatus. The commander in chief the president of the United

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.750
 states has the ability to order you wherever you are needed. And rather

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.470
 than something to be astued, or feared or worried about, I think

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.190
 deployment should be a thing of a goal people in your career want to

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.920
 be deployed so they can get activity and that will allow them to achieve

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.640
 wht they want to achieve. Even those who are reservist frequently

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.370
 want to get the job done and so they will look for a chance to

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.090
 deploy. Let me tell you a quick story. During the first Iraq war the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.820
 commander of naval security group wanted to prove to his superiors

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.540
 that he really did not need reservists, so he issued orders that no

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.260
 reservist would be called up for the cryptologic community in the navy

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.990
 during the Iraq war. That was a huge disappointment to my people

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.710
 in Denver, huge disappointment. So I went down the hall to the intelligence

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.440
 community because they had been called up and some of the guys

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.160
 had gone to Iraq, and I said "look we've all got high level clearances,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.880
 we're all college educated, most of us have advanced degrees,

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.610
 we're technically competent, we know what we're doing we probably could

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.330
 function as intelligence officers if you want us to" and he said

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.060
 "that's great because I got a draft coming home from Iraq right now

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.780
 and we don't have enough people to replace him and I hate to send

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.510
 some of these guys back for the second tour, but we'll take your entire

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.230
 boardroom, that is all your officers and most your chief petty officers

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.950
 if they want to go". One hundred percent of my officers said

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.680
 "I want to do that", the navy will not order me to do that I want to

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.400
 volunteer I want to go do that part of my job. So that's why I think

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.130
 you should look forward to deployment not regret one or trying to

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.850
 avoid one.
