00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.730
well they seem pretty straight forward retail how this works at the institute

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.600
 for creative technology what we found out is you can do a whole

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.470
 bunch of short video clips of someone discussing a particular topic

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.350
 and then cut those up and save them and then ask people who are

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.230
 users to pose a question and then there's something called natural language

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.100
 processing which is seen elaborate and well thought through

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.970
 well practiced and well tested capability of trying to match up the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.850
 questions and the factors in the questions with one of the responses

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.730
 and so the snail natural language processing algorithms will try to

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.600
 find the best response they can that matches your question and then

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.470
 trying to do that with enough regularity itself like a real conversation

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.350
 and to some degree it does because of course in a real conversation

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.230
 you might ask me what's the predominant gas in Martian atmosphere

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.100
 I wouldn't know so a lot of times you have a conversation with somebody

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.970
 you ask him some I don't know ask me so well you know but that's

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.850
 the way it basically works
