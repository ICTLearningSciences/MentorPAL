00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.500
we all come into the world with the notion about who we are welcome in

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.150
 the world with the notion about what's going on around this I don't

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.810
 think any of us early on has to face the really definitive issue of

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.460
 critical thinking we like to believe was gonna make us happy with white

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.110
 to believe that things can work out alright or optimist by nature

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.760
 by Darwinian selection we've become often and we don't really ask

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.420
 the hard questions why is this a good place what could go wrong what

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.070
 are my chances of succeeding have in mind actually qualified enough

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.720
 to do this I knew tons of guys when I was going through college who

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.370
 are committed to going to medical school but to get in the universe

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.020
 Colorado medical school you had the past two semesters of calculus

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.680
 and some of them did not have the right wiring in their brain to do

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.330
 calc they just couldn't do and so somebody they should have done some

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.980
 critical thinking with those P. to say look if you can't do calculus

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.630
 you want to be in the medical field maybe you should do something

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.280
 different maybe should be a clinical psychologist or maybe you should

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.940
 become a radiology technician or something else so you can do the

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.590
 work or become a male our inner female are in you know the other things

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.240
 you can do besides being an MD if you want to do this hello corpsman

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.890
 in the navy or a medic in the army but but you know we all want

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.550
 to fantasize about who we are and who are going to become and without

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.200
 asking the hard questions what is it do I fit can I make myself

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.850
 into that mold our largest you know like that appealed
