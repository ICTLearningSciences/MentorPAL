00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.480
well I am not an athlete I am not I have never been an athlete I am not

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.110
 particularly well coordinated I'm not particularly strong but I'm

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.740
 healthy I got through marine corps boot camp without ever fallen out

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.380
 of a run you know and I got you twenty four years of reserve duty without

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.010
 getting thrown out for not being in shape or getting my way out

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.640
 of control a thing but your have to be a super athlete to be in the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.270
 military you do need some basic level of physical fitness and you

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.900
 gotta watch your weight at my age I frequently go to the international

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.530
 conference on military technology and I'm always amazed at how many

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.170
 fat officers there are in foreign military that's just not put up

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.800
 with anymore in the U. S. military if you see a really grossly overweight

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.430
 member the US military today you give me a call let me know

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.060
 because I don't see it anywhere and if you ever see all movies from

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.690
 World War two look at the general who developed the atomic bomb general

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.320
 Leslie groves and the pictures of him he would get bounced out of

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.960
 the military in a second because he was overweight now that brings

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.590
 about the and a very interesting point he was a vital member of our

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.220
 defense effort more too and yet today the intro about consider looked

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.850
