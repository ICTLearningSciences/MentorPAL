If you're thinking about applying for that an ROTC program I one hundred

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.990
 percent, highly, definitely yes, hundred percent suggest that you

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.560
 should absolutely apply for it because 1.  You don't know if you're

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.140
 gonna be picked up or not you might as well just apply.  2. If you

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.710
 are picked up for it, you have a full year free of tuition and that

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.280
 means that there is zero commitment to military service if you absolutely

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.850
 don't like it after your first year.
