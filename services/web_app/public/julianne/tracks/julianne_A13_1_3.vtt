00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.050
So some decisions that I might be making with like while I'm out in the

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.250
 fleet are is it proper weather to fly , is my aircraft in the air

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.450
 crew are they all ready to fly because the most important thing is that

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.650
 you're not taking off unless you are one hundred percent sure that

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.850
 everything will run smoothly.
