The difference between NJROTC and JROTC is that, 1. the JROTC program

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.710
 is meant for high school students and after you finish the program you

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.140
 don't commission as military officers, you don't have any sort of

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:26.560
 military obligation, it is purely just a community program.  In NROTC,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.990
 the program is meant to train and educate military, I mean train

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:39.420
 and educate college students to then commission as military officers

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.850
 where you will have an obligation to serve.
