00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.730
So my job in the navy will change and the next ten years in the sense

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.600
 that all start off as a student, I can learn how to fly and be learning

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.470
 like all all this night the small steps of the navy, and then as

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.350
 I progress I’ll start being able to fly off ships and like I’ll start

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.230
 be doing more operations for the Navy, and then as they hit my ten

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.100
 year mark I might be transitioning more into an administrative job

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.970
 where I’m making policy in deciding on, you know, where we’re gonna

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:15.850
 fly and what kind of missions we want to do.
