00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.800
For me, STEM has been a really good profession to have. When I was younger,

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.760
 I was very humanities oriented. You could have talked to the seventeen

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.710
 year old me and said, "You will be working on programming or

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.670
 you will be lifting a wrench and doing some electrician things, checking

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.620
 voltage" and I would've said, "You're crazy, that's not me."

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.580
 But there was something in me, maybe because of my past, you know, I

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.530
 used to play chess or because I was good at math, that I thought it

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.490
 was interesting. I wasn't scared of it. So, I think that the people

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.440
 that are like that, the people that look at math problems and who aren't

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.400
 scared of math, I could just say and who aren't scared of science.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.350
 The ones who maybe are challenged but want to learn more so that

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.300
 they can solve the problems. If you are that type of person, then

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.260
 STEM is a really good field to go into. If not, then, I got to say,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.210
 I've met many people in STEM who, you could tell, aren't like that,

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.170
 are just, kind of go with the flow and don't really see the interest

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.120
 in math and interest in science. They're doing it just because it was

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.080
 offered to them and those are the ones who have the biggest problems,

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.030
 those are the ones who kind of, like, fade into another job or

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.990
 maybe even get kicked out because they're not good at the job. So, there

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.940
 has to be some kind of passion for, kind of, numbers, scientific

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.900
 thinking, methodologies, logic. If you're like that, then STEM is

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.850
 a good choice for you.
