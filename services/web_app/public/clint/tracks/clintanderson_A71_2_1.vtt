00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.910
9/11 has a special place in my heart because I had just joined the Navy,

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.960
 well I was in school when it happened. That was, maybe the first

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.020
 year that I was in, I hadn't seen a ship yet. I didn't know what the

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.070
 military life outside of school was like, but I remember walking down

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.130
 my steps to my roommate, when he saw, when we both saw together,

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.180
 the first, actually I saw the second plane hit, the first one had already

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.240
 been hit and my roommate called and he was like, "Hey, look at

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.290
 this!" After it got started, I remember that there was a little bit

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.350
 of fear that I had, you know, I didn't know how big this thing was

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.410
 going to be. I definitely didn't know that there was a war that was

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.460
 about to be started but I did realize that, that's when it finally hit

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.520
 me. Before, I thought, the military is a place that you go, you learn

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.570
 some kind of job, you have a nine to five job and you probably

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.630
 clean some things, you work out a little bit but after 9/11 happened,

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.680
 then I realized, "You know what?", there's a job that needs to be

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.740
 done and I'm probably going to be the one that's going to need to do

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.790
 this. So, I went into protection mode at that time. That's what it

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.850
 meant to me, 9/11.
