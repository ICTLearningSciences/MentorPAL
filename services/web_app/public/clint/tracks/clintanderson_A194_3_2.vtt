00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.740
The person who probably gave me the best advice about my life I have to

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.630
 say, it would be my friends, especially my Navy friends. I have a

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.520
 good friend he was a fellow nuclear electrician with me, we've been

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.410
 learning computer science together, we fought through our electrician

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.290
 trainings together, and he went off and did his own thing and just

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.180
 a conversation that we had you know like sitting around with some coffee

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.070
 or some beers, we talked about like well what do you want to be?

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.960
 Well I wanna be this. What do you want to be? For instance he actually

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.850
 taught me a lot about mortgages and stuff. I read this book that

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.740
 he presented its called Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki, and

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.630
 after reading that book then I kinda got ideas like okay rather than

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.520
 the cubicle thing I probably want to make my own business or something.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.410
 I'd rather you know like have some kind of other income rather

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.290
 than a nine to five job. Or rather we would talk about his prior relationship

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.180
 and the fact that like his wife maybe didn't want to work

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.070
 so much. And we thought about like the income and outcome of his of

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.960
 a one working party system. You know like if one person doesn't work

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.850
 and the other person just takes care of the kids, then I guess you

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.740
 can't be as rich as you normally would be. So that had an effect on me,

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.630
 the person that I wanna meet in the future. Do I want like a housewife,

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.520
 which is fine you know. She could have a decent life making

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.410
 kids and you know making dinner and you know folding clothes. Or do

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.290
 I want a someone who's working, in which case like my clothes would

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.180
 suffer, my kids who suffer, my household chores would suffer you know.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.070
 So like things like that are very very important to consider and

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.960
 to consider wisely and the fireside chats with my friend actually got

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.850
 me to think about my life, my future life very very very hard.
