When you're in the military, especially when you're on deployment, when

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.710
 you're, the ship that you're on is traveling overseas, it can be pretty

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.140
 difficult to stay in touch with family. If you're a high level

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.560
 supervisor then you have access to your computer and it always has

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.990
 internet. But if you just got to the ship, or you've only been in for

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.420
 a couple of years, then it could be awhile before you get behind the

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.850
 computer that allows you to make email conversation. Also you don't

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.280
 have access to phones as much as you would like, and if you do, then

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.710
 have to use a phone card and that can be pretty expensive. However

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.140
 you can kind of tell your family you know my contact with you will

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.560
 be limited, and you can probably still can get a hold of them a couple

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.990
 times per week, no problem for an hour or two and send out emails

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.420
 whenever computers are free, which could be a couple times per day.
