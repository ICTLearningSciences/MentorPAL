00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.270
I think for me, the greatest success that I had was being accepted to

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.680
 my undergraduate university, UC Berkeley. From the time that I got that

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.100
 sheet of paper that said, "You have been accepted", then I realized

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.520
 my life was about to take a really drastic change because I know

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.930
 that that school was, is for some of the smartest kids in America and

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.350
 that paper really told me that all of the things that I'd been trying

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.770
 to do, all of the late night sessions that I had been working on,

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.180
 the homework and the math and the science, all the times that I stayed

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.600
 up overnight, that culminated in someone out there saying, "You

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.020
 know what? We think that you have what it takes to change the world."

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.430
 That's what that paper makes me and that's my biggest success so

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.850
 far.
