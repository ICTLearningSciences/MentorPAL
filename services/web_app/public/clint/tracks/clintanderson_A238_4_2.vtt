00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.170
So, some people ask if there are too many people in the field of computer

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.480
 science and I have an answer for that. Of course, if there are fewer

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.800
 people, then that means the supply and demand thing goes like this

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.120
 and, you know, if there are fewer people, I'll make more money and

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.440
 my skill would be more desirable but that's not the way that I see

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.750
 it. I think that, and I've gotten flak for this before, but I say

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.070
 that everybody should be a programmer and my friend would say, "How

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.390
 can everybody a programmer? You have to, you know, think a certain way

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.700
 and not everybody is, you know, mechanically, you know, programmatically

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.020
 and engineeringly inclined." But I think that programming in

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.340
 particular, is something that not only should everybody do but it's

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.650
 something that everybody should learn. This is what I mean. I was looking

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.970
 at this five-year old and she has a tablet and with this tablet,

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.290
 she goes into the computer and she opens up a program, she plays

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.610
 whatever game she's playing and then she closes it. And to me, that

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.920
 is programming. You might say, "Well, she didn't type anything." Well,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.240
 to me, she operated a computer system and it just so happens that

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.560
 the program that she did was very very easy, it can be done with her

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.870
 finger, it can be done by pressing the start menu and swiping to

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.190
 the left and click on this button and then she makes the thing blow

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.510
 up by pressing this button but this is operating, this is technically

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.830
 programming. It's just doing it in a very very high level abstract

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.140
 way. So, everybody should be able to program and everybody does. Everyone

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.460
 who has a smartphone is technically programming. Everybody who

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.780
 has a tablet is programming. Everyone who knows how to type, technically

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.090
 you're programming. So, I guess it depends on the degree to which

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.410
 you're willing to accept the definition. I think that programming

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.730
 should be in every job as well and to a degree it is. Most people,

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.050
 regardless of what job that you do, is going to be behind a computer

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.360
 at some point in their career. Whether you're an auto mechanic, whether

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.680
 you're a NASA engineer, whether you're an Electrician's Mate,

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.000
 you will be behind the computer doing something online and the more

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.310
 opportunity, the more time you spend behind that computer, the more

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.630
 opportunities that programming itself will help you. So, if you're

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.950
 an auto mechanic, yes, you can use a program that somebody created for

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.260
 you but if you know how to program yourself, then you can create

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.580
 your own program. You can customize it for whatever job you're on, even

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.900
 for your specific work site. So, it can only help you. So, just

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.220
 like I think that everybody should learn how to type and it came to

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.530
 be true, I think that everybody should learn how to program and hopefully

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.850
 it will be true one day as well.
