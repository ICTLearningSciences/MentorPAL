00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.590
Whenever you want to join the military, then you have to go to one of

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.330
 the different service branches. So there's one in every major city,

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.060
 sometimes there are two. So you go into whichever one you feel you might

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.800
 most be fitted for. I actually tried to join the airforce at first,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.540
 but I ended up in the Navy. There's gonna be somebody behind a

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.280
 desk that's going to you know say can you please have a seat, so why

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.020
 do you want to join? What kinds of things interest you? They'll ask

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.750
 lots of questions about like how did in high school, what your interests

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.490
 are, and see if you're a good fit. They're also trying to see

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.230
 if you have a kind of criminal background and if you seem maybe uncommitted,

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.970
 they'll probably push you to the side. But they want to give

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.710
 everybody a chance so after you have your initial conversation with

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.450
 him, he'll ask you to take a practice test. It could be right there

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.180
 at that same time. So the recruiter will guide you to another room

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.920
 and the test is kind of like a little mini scholostic achievement test,

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.660
 a mini SAT. It has a little bit of physics there, math there, a

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.400
 little bit of english there, just general things. So you don't have

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.140
 to be scared of the test, it's not a pass or fail. It's more like what

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.870
 types of jobs you can have. So you take the test and where you score

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.610
 he'll say he has a list of maybe sixty, seventy jobs these are

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.350
 the ones that you qualify for. If you don't qualify for the job you

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.090
 want, then you're allowed to practice a little bit more. He'll give

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.830
 you some resources that you can use to study. But by that time if you

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.560
 are decided on the type of job that you want, that you're willing

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.300
 to do, then he will take you to, he or she will take you to this thing

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.040
 called MEPS, it's military entrance processing place that you can

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.780
 go to with lots of other people who are interested in joining the military

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.520
 to take the real test. The real test is nice and quiet, it's

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.250
 a lot longer, it's very comprehensive, and that's when they can offer

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.990
 you the real job. They'll probably serve you some breakfast in the

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.730
 morning it's an all day thing, and assuming that you pass the test

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.470
 on that same day, they can also have, get you through medical at that

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.210
 time which means that they'll check your eyes, check your dental,

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.950
 make sure that you're physically fit to go through it, and maybe the

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.680
 entire recruiting process could take maybe a week, maybe even a couple

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.420
 of days I have heard. But for me it took several months. They have

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.160
 you in this thing called delayed entrance processing where you do

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.900
 your test, you figure out the job that you want and maybe you don't

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.640
 have to join the service until a good time for them, which could be

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.370
 like a year later or maybe after your high school, after you graduate

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.110
 high school or after you finish your job or something like that.
