00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.180
College, at least for me, was so different than high school. I's like

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.520
 apples and oranges. As a list, number one, the time that you're going

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.850
 is a lot different. In high school, it's eight hours, it's kind of,

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.180
 like, a full-time job. In college, your classes, my classes were sporadic,

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.520
 they're all over the places. Monday, I would have a three hour

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.850
 class. Tuesday I'd have no classes. Wednesday and Thursday, I'd

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.180
 have a two hour in the morning and two hour at night. So, there's a

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.520
 lot more freedom. However, you might realize, "Hey, you know what? You

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.850
 go to school less in college. It's quite the opposite. You actually

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.180
 study more in school, in college." So, that three hour class that

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.520
 I had on Monday, it's going to have six hours of homework, of things

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.850
 that I have to do, of reading, of getting together with group mates,

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.180
 of going to the lecture and asking questions and, which leads me

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.520
 to the second point, that no one is going to babysit you. In high school,

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.850
 the professor says, "You didn't do your homework. Well, why not?"

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.180
 Then, if you don't do it, like, five or six times in a row, they

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.520
 might talk to your parents or they might give you some kind of meaningful

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.850
 feedback. In college, they just give you a grade. Yes, there

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.180
 are people that care about you. Yes, if you go to them, then they will

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.520
 be open with you about what you should and shouldn't learn. However,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.850
 if you don't want to learn and you want to take your F, then, no

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.180
 one there will stop you. In fact, they don't really pay attention until

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.520
 you finally take your final test and you get that F. So, it's all

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.850
 up to you. So, the hours are different. The amount of time that you

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.180
 have to spend in college is a lot more and no one's going to babysit

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.520
 you. Those the two ways that high school is different than college.
