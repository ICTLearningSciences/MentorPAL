00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.280
Something I wish I would have known before I chose nuclear technology,

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.710
 is how cool computer science could be. When I was a kid I was just

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.140
 thinking computer science what you know, they type all day and there's

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.560
 like ones and zeroes and it's terrible and you know lots of math,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.990
 very complex for no reason. That's what I thought, but after I got

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.420
 out I realized woah wait a second, I can make games? And it's not that

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.850
 difficult, you know there are tools to help you so you aren't dealing

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.280
 with ones and zeroes, you can deal with like normal conversation

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.710
 when you code? Aw man. So I wish number one, I wish my dad would have

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.140
 bought me a computer when I was a kid, and that didn't happen. So

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.560
 number two, before I joined nuclear tech, as a nuclear technologist

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.990
 you know as an Electrician's Mate, and I wish someone would have told

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.420
 me about other computer science fields, because that's what I'm

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.850
 doing now that's my passion, you could say.
