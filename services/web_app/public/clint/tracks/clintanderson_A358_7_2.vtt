00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.530
In my college career I've really experienced being confused a lot. Confusion

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.220
 is a big part of the college experience. Number one it helps

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.900
 you become a better person, but number two there are just some bad teachers

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.590
 obviously, or maybe you're just a bad student you know, or some

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.270
 combination of all those three. And when every you're in one of

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.960
 those situations where you're listening to the teacher, you're looking

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.640
 at the book, you're reading, you're doing your homework as much as

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.320
 you can and you're just lost, how do you get through it? That's when

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.010
 you have to depend on your friends. You have to go to people that

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.690
 have taken the class before and try to ask as many questions as possible.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.380
 Go to the professor and even though you do it one time, two times,

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.060
 three times, I think the more that you come the more he'll understand

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.740
 as a person, the more he'll understand the way it is to teach

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.430
 you, and he might change, he or she might change the way that they

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.110
 talk to you. So the point is to keep going, have that commitment to

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.800
 don't give up, to never just say to heck with it let me move on to

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.480
 the next thing because your college career will be lengthened substantially

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.170
 that way. You want to really master your subject so go to your

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.850
 professors go to your friends and they'll help you out.
