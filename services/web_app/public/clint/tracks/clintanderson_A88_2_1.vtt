00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.950
So some of the technology that I worked on in my career as a nuclear technician,

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.040
 it's kind of divided into two parts because the nuclear technology

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.140
 field is divided into two parts. The first one is electrical

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:21.230
 things, I'm an Electrician's Mate, so I used many components like

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.330
 a watt meter, a volt meter, oscilloscope these are all equipment that

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.420
 you use to touch things around the plant to get readings on them.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.520
 See what their oil level is, see what they're voltage is, see what

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.610
 the current is, see what the power is. So they're really used all throughout

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.710
 America as electricians as use them. The other part of my job,

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.800
 the nuclear technology field, is very specific most of the time.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.900
 But if you think of Homer Simpson, he was a nuclear technologist. It

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.990
 only deals with things that the uranium cycle can do to make power.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.090
 So some of things that I worked on deal with the nuclear part of the

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.180
 aircraft carrier and the way that it makes the ship run. So for instance

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.280
 it makes electricity. So for instance I worked with turbine

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.370
 generators. The nuclear technology of the aircraft carrier makes steam,

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.470
 so the steam will power lots of different things all around the

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.560
 ship. So all of the valves that it takes to make sure that the steam

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.660
 goes to the right places, so that a spin pumps, or to move the screws

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.750
 of the aircraft carrier so that it can move through the water. All

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.850
 of those are things I dealt with as far as technology.
