00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.140
Although I've never really experience of physical combat myself, I'm very

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.420
 thankful for that. I know that there are many people out there that

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.710
 do, and I give them lots of credit. My role in the Navy has been

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.990
 a supporting role. We go on these things called deployments where you're

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.280
 on a boat like a destroyer or an aircraft carrier. You go into

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.560
 the middle of the ocean and then those things provide support to the

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.850
 combatants. My aircraft carrier supported aircraft that go and drop

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.140
 bombs and you know shoot things. So my role was to support them. Those

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.420
 days were really long, really intensive sometimes. You can wake

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.710
 up at 6 AM, and then you might not have an opportunity to go to sleep

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.990
 until night the next day, and there are many days like that. There

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.280
 are days that you would be really tired, but you have to fight through

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.560
 it, you have to fight through the sleep, you have to drink lots

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.850
 of coffee, you have to really be very mature so that you don't make

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.140
 mistakes on the job that can endanger somebody. So after going through

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.420
 all of those those deployments, you know six months, seven month,

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.710
 eight month long deployments, I come away with a couple of things.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.990
 Number one, respect for those people that do that. I think even though

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.280
 right now maybe I might not go on another deployment, but I really

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.560
 respect the veterans who have served, and even the combatants. Number

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.850
 two, I know that for myself, I can almost be faced with anything

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.140
 and be able to take it head on. I don't think that I'll be in another

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.420
 situation that is that intensive in my life. There can be situations

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.710
 like that, but I don't think I'll ever sweat as much, I don't think

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.990
 I'll ever be as sleepy as much, I don't think I'll ever be trained

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.280
 as much as I was during those times. So it made me a better person

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.560
 and I put that on my college resume because it's absolutely true.
