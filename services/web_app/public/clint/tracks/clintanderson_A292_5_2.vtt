00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.030
If you plan on going to college and you need to take out a big loan to

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.200
 do it, my suggestion is, make sure that your future job prospects align

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.380
 with the amount of money that you're taking. If you're going to

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.560
 be an engineer and engineers make, you know, decent amounts of money

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.730
 depending on what type of job you get, then going to an expensive

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.910
 private university for four years might be worth it. That four year

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.090
 university could be the opportunity to get that high paying job. There

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.260
 are many high paying humanities jobs out there. For many people,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.440
 the jobs aren't as salary intensive as engineering jobs. So, if that's

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.610
 the case for you, then taking out a big student loan could affect

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.790
 you so far into the future that it might not be worth it. My suggestion

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.970
 for you in that case would be to think about other opportunities

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.140
 to pay for your education during that time such as scholarships, such

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.320
 as working part-time, such as going to summer school where the classes

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.500
 are cheaper, ways to cut down on the total cost. Or even going

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.670
 to community college, that's another way to, kind of, cut the cost

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.850
 in half.
