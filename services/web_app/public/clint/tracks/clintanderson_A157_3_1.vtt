00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.230
So my salary obviously it changes every time I get promoted. It also changes

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.600
 every two years, so the longer that you're in the military you

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.970
 get a little bit more money. So right now I'm a chief and it depends

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.350
 on which, which city you live in, which is gonna dictate your BAH

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.730
 your basic allowance for housing, but everybody makes the same basic

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.100
 pay. So my basic pay right now is $4,500 per month, if I were to be

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.470
 active active duty service, and I also get another couple thousand

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.850
 dollars are for my BAH which is the money that they give you for housing.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.230
 So all in all it's about $75,000 per year with 16 years in. A

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.600
 person who just barely comes in, he's not going to get, he or she is

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.970
 not going to get that BAH. They will probably just be living on a

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.350
 ship or something like that, and as far as the basic pay, it's probably

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.730
 just a couple thousand dollars maybe $3,000 when you talk about

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:16.100
 outside of boot camp. So it's about $35,000 to start. So one year in

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.470
 the military you're at $35,000, 16 years you're at $75,000, and that's

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.850
 from an E1 to a chief, it ramps accordingly.
