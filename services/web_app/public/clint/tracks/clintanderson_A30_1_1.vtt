Problems show up every now and then. When you're on active duty, so it

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.850
 kind of depends on whether you're deployed or not. If you're deployed,

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.850
 that means things happen, you know, with any mechanical equipment.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.850
 So, pumps could break in the middle of the night and then you get

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 waken up and, you know, you have to go fix it. Sometimes you have people

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.850
 that come in drunk, on the weekends and when we were in port,

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.850
 so you'd have to make sure that, like, to get to their bed safely and

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.850
 that they get disciplined later on. Things like that happen on deployment.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.850
 When you are not deployed, then you still hear the drunk people

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 coming in, you know, but because you're not, the ship isn't being

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.850
 used over and over and over every single day in and out, problems

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.850
 with the equipment doesn't happen as much. So, you just do preventive

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.850
 maintenance, which means that even though this pump looks fine, you're

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.850
 just going to open it up and check to make sure that the oil is

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 there, and you know, that is at the right temperature and shut it.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.850
 So, a lot easier time.
