I'm really impressed with computer science because it has so much diversity

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.400
 in it. With computer science you can be working on web design,

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.670
 you can work with graphics which deals with what the screen looks like

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.940
 whether it's like really photo realistic or whether it's cartoonish

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.210
 you can work with hardware, so you open up a computer and all the

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.490
 things that are inside the mother board the chips the the graphics

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.760
 card, you can work with different types of software so you can have

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.030
 different languages that you can work in, I work with Unity engine

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.300
 which is making games but you can also work with different types of

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.580
 applications people work on the latest version of Microsoft things like

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.850
 that.
