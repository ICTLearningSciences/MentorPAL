00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.550
The biggest struggle that I had to overcome, to finally be a Chief in

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.260
 the United States Military Reserve, to be a  Master's student at the

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.960
 University of Southern California, I had to really fend for myself

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.660
 for much of my life. I've had family that's taking care of me, I'm very

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.370
 thankful for that. All the way up until I was eighteen. After I

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.070
 turned eighteen, then I split from my father and I hadn't really seen

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.780
 too much of my family after that. So, I had to support myself, my

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.480
 own finances. Yeah, when I was eighteen, I had, like, forty dollars

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.180
 in my pocket and I think I was working part time at McDonald's and,

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.890
 you know, just a few bags of clothes at my feet and that's all I had

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.590
 in the world, you know. I guess everything I had was, you now, a couple

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.290
 of hundred dollars worth, maybe a hundred bucks worth, and that's

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.000
 it. So, I had to get from that to somehow getting a job with a good

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.700
 career that I could support myself and pay for my education eventually

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.410
 on my own and many people are like that. When you're eighteen,

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.110
 you know, you can get a job and you know, kind of support yourself

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.810
 but throughout this whole entire time, even when I wasn't in the military,

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.520
 I had to, you know, buy my own place, you know, support myself

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.220
 with my rent, with my food and without any skills, it was really difficult,

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.920
 I have to say. So, if you have a family that can support you

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.630
 during those times, that you can always go back to them if you lose

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.330
 your job, if you have to borrow the car, like little things like

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.040
 that, I didn't have. So, getting past that was a big step for me, it

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.740
 was a real challenge for me not having a family but eventually, I eventually

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.440
 joined the military and from that point on, everything was

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.150
 pretty much handed to you. So, they're my second family you could say,

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.850
 and they took care of me.
