00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.030
The impact that you can have as an engineer and particularly computer

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.210
 scientists are amazing. So when I was in the military I did a job and

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.400
 I noticed that whatever I did on January 1st wouldn't really be recognized

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.580
 on December 31st, it's because I'm doing the same job. That's

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.760
 fine for a lot of people, but for me I chose to try something different

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.940
 than the military job that I was doing because I wanted my job

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.120
 to be persistent. So this is what I mean. Right now I'm with the University

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.300
 of Southern California's Institute for Creative Technology

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.490
 making this video. This video could be seen by thousands, hundreds

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.670
 of thousands, hopefully millions of other Navy people. I could affect

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.850
 those lives. These are things that are going to be happening you know

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.030
 five years from now, ten years from now. So I can actually affect

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.210
 my world. Many engineering communities are like that. If you're making

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.400
 a robot right, if you make that robot on January 1st, hopefully

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.580
 December 31st you're shipping that robot, and that robot will go to

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.760
 Afghanistan and find a bomb you know. If you're an electrical technician,

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.940
 maybe you're making some kind of new component for a car and

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.120
 later on that car is gonna be faster because of the component you made. So

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.300
 for a lot of engineering jobs you work and then you create a

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.490
 component, you create a product, and then you can see that product in

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.670
 action, and that's one of the biggest benefits of being in a STEM

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.850
 field.
