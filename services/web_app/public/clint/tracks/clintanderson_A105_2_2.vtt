00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.330
Japan, for me, has been one of the most awesome experiences of my life.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.810
 This is the third time that I have come here. The first was with the

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.290
 military, I want to Sasebo which is at the very bottom of Japan kind

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.780
 of like a country version of Japan, but I did go to a big city,

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.260
 Fukuoka, and it was really big, really huge they have amazing stores.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.740
 The electronics store that I went to it was, it had like ten floors

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.220
 and one of the floors is like Best Buy in America. Best Buy is America's

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.700
 most most most, it has the most electronic stuff that America

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.180
 can provide and it's on one big you know humongus floor but Japan has

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.660
 eight of those guys like if you want a camera at Best Buy well here's

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.150
 a stand you know you can see below there's fifty cameras, oh cool.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.630
 No no, you haven't seen cameras until you go to Japan where they

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.110
 have an entire section of a floor devoted to cameras. You want a laptop

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.590
 okay at the you know Best Buy has this there's the apple section

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.070
 there's like you know twenty, twenty laptops over there you know.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.550
 Japan is the place so. As far as the food goes, I switch over. When

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.040
 I'm in America I love ice cream, when I'm in Japan it switches over

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.520
 to ramen. Ramen is the best delicious food that has every went into

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.000
 my body it's so good. There was one time I ate ramen every single day.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.480
 Also anime is, it's abundant over here so I don't really watch anime

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.960
 here. It's amazing that I watch anime more in America than here,

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.440
 cause it's kind of kid like here, but you see it all, on all places

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.920
 like whenever you are walking down the street you can see like a cartoon

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.410
 figure and all the pop characters you know, they have places like

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.890
 na-na-na-na you have to, you have to go visit it, it's so funny.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.370
 Just being in this different culture, it's way different than America,

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.850
 and I'm digging it.
