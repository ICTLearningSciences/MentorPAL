00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.350
I think that there are fewer minorities in STEM, based on the difference

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.850
 in culture. So, I've lived in a white household, not the entire time,

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.350
 but for some portion of my life and I kind of saw the way that

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.850
 education was being presented to me and to the students that I saw around

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.350
 us. Education is number one, you're supposed to be doing your

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.850
 homework when you come home. You know, there's probably an hour, two

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.350
 hours that you have to, you know, focus on your education and then

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.850
 you can go play, things like that. Whereas in the black households that

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.350
 I lived in, it really wasn't an issue. For instance, my mother,

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.850
 she didn't even graduate high school. My father did, but he wasn't really

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.350
 interested in my education. So, there were things that I did when

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.850
 I was a kid. They give you five dollars if you, you know, like,

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.350
 do all your homework for that week or they look at your report card

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.850
 and, you know, "As and Bs, okay, well, you know, you don't get in trouble"

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.350
 or things like that. But it wasn't really, college wasn't really

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.850
 pushed. For instance, I never heard the name of any college from

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.350
 any of my family, my mom's side or my dad's side, because they were

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.850
 divorced right. So, that's opposed to the white households that I lived

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.350
 in and, you know, then you're always hearing about University of

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.850
 Michigan and, you know, we're going to go to a college game this weekend

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.350
 or this person is coming from University of Nebraska and you

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.850
 know, here is what he's doing. So, it's, those things are pushed on

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.350
 you, you know, every week, every other day, you know, it's part of the

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.850
 culture. You're expected to graduate from high school and then go

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.350
 on to college and that's very obvious whereas in the, I even lived

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.850
 in a Mexican household and it just wasn't there. The parents usually

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.350
 didn't go to college themselves and it's more like you have a range

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.850
 of different possibilities. You can go to college, if you're smart

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.350
 or you can work down the street, that's where your father worked. Or,

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.850
 you can just live your own life and make your own choices. Those are

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.350
 the options that are available and that are persistent in minority

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.850
 cultures. So, I think, we, if you want to send more kids to college,

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.350
 it should be an expectation that you're go to college from the family,

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.850
 rather than just be a choice and do whatever you want to do.
