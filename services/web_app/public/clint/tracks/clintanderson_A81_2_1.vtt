00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.470
My career field is very very unique. From what I understand, 60% of the

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.100
 nuclear technicians out there in the world come from the Navy. So,

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.730
 I'm a nuclear technician. I don't think that I would have had his training

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.350
 had I not joined the military itself. So, being a nuke is very

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.970
 very specific. You know, there aren't that many places that have

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.600
 it, the nuclear power plants up along the edges of America and there

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.230
 are the subs in the ships of the United States Navy. So, that's very

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.850
 unique in itself.
