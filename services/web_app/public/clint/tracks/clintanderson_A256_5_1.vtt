00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.180
The specific courses that I would recommend in college, basically anything

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.520
 engineering-ish. So before I joined the nuclear Navy, I took some

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.850
 community classes to kind of, prepare myself. I took conceptual physics

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.180
 because I had never taking physics before, and I took precalculus

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.520
 math because I know I would be learning calculus concepts later

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.850
 on. But whatever your level is, maybe you're not calculus ready yet,

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.180
 just take your bottom math and even though you weren't good at it

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.520
 before you know, it's kind of important. So bust out your high school

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.850
 skills, bust out your homework doing skills, and try to take on a

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.180
 mathematical class. Even if you have to repeat one, even though you

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.520
 did it in high school, try to do it over again if that's not your strong

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.850
 suit. Any science class could or could not, so you might not be

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.180
 using chemistry so much, so you can probably skip that unless you have

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.520
 some kind of chemical intensive job, but physics is a good one.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.850
 I've seen many physics concepts in all of my engineering jobs that's

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.180
 computer science that's nuclear technology. Math, all the math that

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.520
 you can, as high as you can, up to differential equations. So that

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.850
 includes pre calculus math, calculus math, discrete math, differential

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.180
 equations, basically all the undergrad college level courses that

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.520
 you can take. If you take them in high school that's even better. And

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.850
 I think those are the two main ones, physics and all the math.
