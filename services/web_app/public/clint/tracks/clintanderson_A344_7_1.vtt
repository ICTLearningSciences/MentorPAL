00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.210
When I first started college, I really had the idea that I didn't want

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.570
 to work while I was in college. I really wanted to focus on my school,

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.930
 focus on my work. However when I looked at what was available I

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.290
 kind of saw that the jobs that you have in college are really really

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.650
 important for your success, for understanding what it is you're doing.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.010
 When I was an undergrad I became a residential computing consultant

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.370
 which is someone that goes to the dormitories, looks at people's

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.730
 computers fixes their wifi. That experience was so great. It's one

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.090
 of the crowning glories of my Berkeley experience because I remember

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.450
 those things. I remember the people. I remember the coworkers that

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.810
 I had, and the parties that I went to, it was very, very good. Not only

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.170
 that, it paid a decent amount of salary that helped me get through

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.530
 my college years. When I became a graduate school, I also had the

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.890
 impression like no I'm gonna go to school, I'm going to focus on my

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.250
 classes and not worry about jobs. I had enough money to support myself.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.610
 However a job showed up, the job that you're seeing right now that

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.970
 I'm doing, that really fit in to my major specifically. I study

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.330
 game development and a job came along that said well if you've been

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.690
 in the military, and if you are studing game development, and if you

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.050
 know computer science and if you're interested in game design, then

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.410
 we have a job for you. So that was, it was awe-inspiring that a job

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.770
 like that existed for me, and again in my graduate school that's one,

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.130
 it's one of the main things that I remember from my education. So

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.490
 having a job can be an integral part of your college experience if

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.850
 you choose the right one.
