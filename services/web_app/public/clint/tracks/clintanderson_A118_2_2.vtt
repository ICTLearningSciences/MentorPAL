There are many opportunities for internships if you're going into the

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.710
 stem field. I know that I had an internship myself at the Department

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.640
 of Defense. I worked at the Naval training station in Orlando and it

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.560
 was my first internship, it dealt with computer science. I was working

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.490
 on making speech more understandable for a computer as you talk

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.420
 to it, so that was really good. So I think the Department of Defense,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.350
 I think you just Google DOD internships and press enter and then

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.280
 there's, probably the whole first there's lots of different postings

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.210
 for you. So at every military installation, let's say in California

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.140
 at Corona, at San Diego, at SWRMC (South West Regional Maintenence

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.060
 Center), at even the San Diego Naval base. There's probably some opportunity

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.990
 for high school students and college graduates to get a little

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.920
 bit of taste of what the federal government and what the military

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.850
 can offer for military careers.
