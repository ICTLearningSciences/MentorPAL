00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.320
My favorite classes have been, well I wanna say language classes because

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.800
 those are always interesting, they're always kind of fun. I also

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.270
 liked my computer science classes, but I guess the most impressive classes

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.740
 that I have taken-or that I had taken-was this course called

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.220
 discourse analysis. So I was going to Berkeley and it's known for being

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.690
 really really educationally intensive, right, and I didn't really

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.170
 see that so much in my computer science classes and even my language

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.640
 classes, there's just lots of work and you're expected to do, you

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.110
 know like, be up until midnight. But this course, this discourse analysis,

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.590
 it really showed me-it was taught by a really smart professor,

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.060
 and she, she really knew what she was talking about. We studied things

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.530
 like Martin Luther King speeches or the way that a politician

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.010
 twists words to make it seem like he's answering the question but he

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.480
 really answers something different, and these are things that even

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.960
 as a smart person, you know, growing up I listened to and I just accepted,

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.430
 but I never really thought about as succinctly as she taught

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.900
 me how to. So that course really really opened my mind and opened, you

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.380
 know made me a really wiser person because of that, so discourse

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.850
 analysis was great.
