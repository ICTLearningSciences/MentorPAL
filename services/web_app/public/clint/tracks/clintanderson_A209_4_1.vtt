I think the biggest benefit that I have as a computer scientist is the

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.760
 fact that it's pretty fun for me. It's like playing a video game sometimes.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.210
 I'm doing my job, I'm doing my work and you know, I'm thinking,

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.670
 like, you know, three-four steps down the line and you know, another

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.120
 friend comes over, he looks over my shoulder and, "Oh, did you

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.580
 try this?" and like, "Well, I want to do it this way" and there's like

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.030
 3-4 different ways that you can do it and, you know, I try to do

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.490
 it and he does it over my shoulder and then I have to say, "Oh wow,

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.940
 you know that was a lot better. You know, it's faster, it's has less

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.400
 code. You know, I learned something". So, yeah basically, it's fun.
