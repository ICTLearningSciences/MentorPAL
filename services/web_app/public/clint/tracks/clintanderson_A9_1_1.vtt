00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.760
In Michigan, it's the place that I stayed had a diverse amount of people

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.670
 but it was mostly crime ridden in some places. I've seen lots of

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.580
 things that you see on movies. For instance, drug use, some violence

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.490
 here and there. I've seen more graphic things like prostitution, homeless

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.400
 shelter and things like that. But those are things that I think

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.300
 maybe turned me into wanting to help my society a little bit more.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.210
 Those are negative things. These are things that kind of pushed me

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.120
 to want to make the world a better place because I saw them. So, even

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.030
 though Michigan was, the part that I grew up in, Flint, isn't the,

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.940
 you know, ideal city, it is a good place to grow up and develop your

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.850
 character.
