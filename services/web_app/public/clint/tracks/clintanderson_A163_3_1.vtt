00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.260
The Navy has some of the best retirement packages in the United States,

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.670
 that's hands down. After you've been in for twenty years, then you're

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.080
 allowed to have retirement. At the end of your twenty years, you

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.490
 can either on say I would like to retire, or you can stay in up to

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.900
 thirty years. So every year that you're in you get to have two and a

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.300
 half percent longer than twenty years. At twenty years you get half

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.710
 of your basic pay, so this is what I mean. The Navy gives you lots

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.120
 of money while you're in based on certain things. Sixty percent of what

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.530
 you make is your basic pay, then you get a little more for sustenance,

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.940
 which is just the basic things that you need for your home. You

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.350
 also get a little bit more for if you're on a submarine or not. Also

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.760
 you get some more basic allowance for housing for your housing costs.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.170
 But sixty percent of that is your basic pay. So the navy gives

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.580
 you half that at a twenty year point. I'm a chief, I make $4,500 per

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.990
 month so they give me half of that at twenty years. If I chose to

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.400
 stay in longer then the add on another two and a half percent, two and

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.800
 a half percent, two and a half percent. Depending on what I retire

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.210
 as, it can be up to thirty years, so at thirty years that'll be seventy

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.620
 five percent of your basic pay. Now because I'm a chief I make

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.030
 $4,500 per month, but they basically take your highest three months

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.440
 of earning, and that's the cost that that they provide you for your

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.850
 retirement.
