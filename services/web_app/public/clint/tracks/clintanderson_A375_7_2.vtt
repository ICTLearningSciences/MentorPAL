00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.790
When I first got to boot camp, I'm just like everyone else. Everyone starts

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.740
 as an E1. On my contract before I joined, they said well if you're

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.680
 a nuclear technician then you get automatic advancement to E3.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.630
 So during boot camp I was actually, I had three stripes on my shirt.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.570
 However, I was getting paid as the lowest class. You don't actually

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.520
 get to have that salary until you finish your boot camp and you go

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.460
 on to your first A school. In boot camp it really doesn't mean too much

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.410
 whether you have one stripe or two stripes or three stripes. It's

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.350
 just kinda like there for maybe for self motivation but as soon as

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.290
 you get to your A school, you don't have any responsibiltiies. You're

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.240
 not in charge of anybody. You're just there mostly as a student.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.180
 After my A school and after my power school and prototype-those were

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.130
 my schools that lasted two weeks or I'm sorry two years-for my nuclear

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:10.070
 training. Once you first get to your real you know first full on

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.020
 job-mine was an airline carrier-even there you don't have any real

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.960
 responsibility or position, you're just there to learn as a journeyman

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.910
 so you don't get you're first real role or responsibility until about

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.850
 about a few months after you get to your first command.
