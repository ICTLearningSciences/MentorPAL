It might be pretty difficult to pay for your education if you're just

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.750
 doing it out of your own pocket. One way is to suck the money from your

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.200
 parents if they have that kind of cash. Another way is loans and

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.650
 I'm doing the loan thing now and it's not so great. But it is an option,

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.100
 especially if you have, like, a STEM related career where you

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.550
 know you're going to make that money back in a fast way. If you have

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.000
 a humanities job and you go to an expensive university, then you could

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.450
 be paying that money back for a long time. So, maybe loans aren't

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.900
 the best way to pay for your own education. The best way I recommend

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.350
 is scholarships and scholarships, I've had a few scholarships myself

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.800
 and they've been super great. You think of a few different lines

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.250
 to write for their questions, it could be a page or two pages, maybe

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.700
 something that you've done out in the community, maybe it's something

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.150
 from your past that they recognizing you for and you get free money,

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.600
 you get free cash and that's helped me out a lot. The first time

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.050
 I went to Japan during education abroad, I got a scholarship and I

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.500
 really needed that money and it came through. You can also join the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.950
 military like I did, I got fifty thousand dollars for joining the nuclear

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.400
 field and that paid for all of my undergraduate and a little

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.850
 bit of my master's course.
