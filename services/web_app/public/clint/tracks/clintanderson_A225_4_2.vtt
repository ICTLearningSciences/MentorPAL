00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.610
A pivotal moment for me was the first time that I was accepted to UC Berkeley.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.370
 Obviously it's a great school and anybody would be really proud

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.140
 to go there but until that time, I felt, even though I was in the

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.900
 nuclear navy and you're allowed to have a really good job at the

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.660
 end, I knew that that job, being a nuclear-trained operator in the civilian

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.420
 world or even as a navy person, that wasn't for me, so it's

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.180
 kind of, like, I had to start fresh, and I did. After the military,

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.950
 I decided to be a computer scientist and I wasn't the best computer

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.710
 scientist around but I did have the good work ethic and it was obvious

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.470
 that I was trying really hard but I didn't really have a strong sense

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.230
 of my own confidence until Berkeley said that they were accepting

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.990
 me. That's when I knew, "Hey, you know what? There are people that

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.750
 have been trying their whole entire lives to try to get into this

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.520
 school. There are people with 4.0s, with perfect SAT scores that are

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.280
 trying to get into this school" and for them to accept me, that's kind

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.040
 of, validation for me. I know going to university isn't validation,

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.800
 any type of university isn't validation but it's something that

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.560
 I was trying really hard to do and I was successful at it. So, I consider

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.330
 that maybe one of my first major successes. Being in the navy

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.090
 was one of them and getting the UC Berkeley acceptance was another one.
