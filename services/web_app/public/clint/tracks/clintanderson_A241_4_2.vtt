00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.280
For me, the most important factor that could change my future has been

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.710
 the same for the last twenty years and that's me, myself. If I can

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:17.140
 somehow make myself motivated, give myself some kind of strength to

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.560
 be a better learner, do better at my homework, you know, somehow get

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.990
 in the gym and start hitting those weights, be a better person all

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.420
 around, then I'll get to where I need to be. If I stick around, just

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.850
 playing video games all day and kind of, just hang out with my friends

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.280
 and not really pushing myself, then I'll still do fine but I just

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.710
 won't be exceptional. That's what I need to be. So, I think it depends

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.140
 on myself, that's the biggest factor. Of course, friends and family

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.560
 can help. If I have a mentor, you know, that always helps. If I

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.990
 have other the people that depend on me, then that's another motivation

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.420
 factor but if it doesn't come from me myself, then I won't get

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.850
 to where I need to be.
