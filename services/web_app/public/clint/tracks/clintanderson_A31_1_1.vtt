00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.810
So, you probably heard of the term 'drunken sailors' and that's for a

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.770
 good reason. Once you are deployed and you pull into a port, which is

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.730
 like a little city of a new country, then the people are very very

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.700
 antsy and they want to get out and, you know, party a little bit. So,

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.660
 you probably been on the ship, in the middle of the ocean, you haven't

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.620
 seen another, you know, non-military soul for about a month. So,

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.580
 they really want to go out there and, you know, like, you know, do

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.540
 the opposite of what they were doing which is being disciplined. Now,

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.500
 they want to, you know, go be young kids. The military's basically

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.470
 eighteen to twenty four year olds. So, kind of like the college life.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.430
 So, they go out there and do college level things. They find the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.390
 first bar, they sit with each other and just, you know, find, you

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.350
 know, the cheapest alcohol and you could find them there the whole entire

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.310
 day and then they come back to the ship. The military knows this,

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.270
 so they have people walking around, checking into the bars, making

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.230
 sure they aren't caught causing fights, which they are, make sure

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.200
 that people aren't, you know, drinking too much which they are, make

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.160
 sure that people can make it home safely, you know, which means that

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.120
 they come back by taxi, which means that they come in handcuffs sometimes

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.080
 but it's all in good fun. By the time we leave, out of five

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.040
 thousand people or sometimes eight thousand people that are there,

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.000
 you only have maybe one or two that actually get into real big trouble.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.970
 I personally didn't, I personally wasn't involved in that drunk

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.930
 culture so much. I actually liked to go out to the town and explore,

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.890
 you know, the museums and the scenery and things like that but I had

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.850
 a few drinks myself too.
