00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.700
Is my work boring, is my engineering life boring? I have to say sometimes

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.550
 it is. There many times that we were asked to clean, and I hate

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.400
 cleaning. But at least for the aircraft carrier that I was on, you clean

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.250
 all the time, every single day, at least one hour. For some of

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.100
 the training that we do it's also boring. Especially the things that

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.950
 you don't know well, then it's just coming at you and your mind just

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.800
 kind of blanks out. For the things that you do know well, then you've

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.650
 heard it thousands and thousands of times, so you don't really pay

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.500
 attention to that either. It's the things in the middle, that you

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.350
 know fifty sixty percent of and you have that kind of interest in okay

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.200
 well what what is it that I'm missing? But those times are not all

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.050
 the time. So it can be boring, but I think whether stem careers are

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.900
 boring should be seen in the range of other jobs. So you can say

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.750
 is a McDonald's career boring? Well you're flipping burgers and maybe

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.600
 the first couple weeks it's interesting, I'm learning this, and I

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.450
 know how to push this button, but then after you do for a long time

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.300
 then it gets kind of repetitive. So as with every other job, STEM jobs

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.150
 can be repetitive sometimes. It's important to kind of get the job

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.000
 that you think you're interested in so you have very few of those

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.850
 repetitive days.
