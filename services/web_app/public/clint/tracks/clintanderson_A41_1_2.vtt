00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.540
Since I became a civilian, I think I travel a lot more than I did in the

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.230
 Navy. With the Navy, you actually get stationed all over the country.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.930
 Now that I'm civilian, I pretty much stay in California, that's

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.620
 my hometown but I have the opportunity to travel a lot more. So, I

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.310
 take flights to New York, just, if I feel like it. I take drives to

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.000
 Las Vegas, because it's kind of close to Los Angeles and I also still

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.700
 get to travel a lot because of the US Navy Reserve. So, in the US

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.390
 Navy Reserve, they send you to the four corners of America. We go to

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.080
 New Hampshire, to  Virginia, also to Washington and San Diego. So,

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.770
 pretty much every year, they actually send me there. They give you a

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.470
 free car and a free hotel, so it's kind of like, a little mini travel.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.160
 Work isn't that difficult, so I use that as a way to get out. I

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.850
 was also stationed in Hawaii last year and that was really fun.
