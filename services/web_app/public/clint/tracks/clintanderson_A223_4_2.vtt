00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.790
In the STEM career, your working environment can change so much. So, when

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.740
 I was in the military, as an Electrician's Mate, I had different

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.680
 watches that I would go to. So, I could be sitting in a chair, with

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.620
 a little handle twisting and left and right, so that there can be more

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.560
 steam, so that the ship can go faster or slower and you do that

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.510
 for six hours in this nice air-conditioned room. The mechanics outside

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.450
 of the little station that I was at, they're on the hot deck with

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.390
 steam rushing by them, so it's really really sweaty and kind of greasy

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.340
 and they do that for six hours and they just go around walking,

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.280
 looking at gauges, checking oil pressure, cleaning up whenever it needs

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.220
 to happen and running around left and right, you know, picking up

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.160
 phones. So, they have almost the opposite situation that I was in.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.110
 I was in a nice conditioned area, you know, sitting in a chair for

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.050
 six hours, they're standing up, walking up and down the stairs, doing

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.990
 this job. That was the military life and obviously it can range, you

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.940
 know, there are cooks that are behind the stove all day, flipping

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.880
 burgers like they're in McDonald's, there is the watch station supervisor

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.820
 who's running on three decks in two different plants, sometimes

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.760
 going up four flights of stairs just to make sure that everybody's

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.710
 doing the job that they're supposed to be doing and there's the Boatswain's

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.650
 Mate, who is turning the ship left and right, who has really

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.590
 high-level people, maybe he's talking to the commanding officer,

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.540
 talking to the executive officer with, like, three people behind him

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.480
 and, you know, it's very very, like, has to be very strict and, you

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.420
 know, says things, you know, the right thing at the right time so that

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.360
 the ship doesn't crash into another ship. So, depends on your job

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.310
 obviously, your living conditions. As a computer scientist, my job

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.250
 has ranged from working as a residential <unknown> consultant, going

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.190
 from building to building, house to house, talking with different

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.140
 students about how their operating system works or how to make it work

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.080
 better or remove viruses or something. Also, at my job at the University

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.020
 of Southern California I was working as a QA inspector, a QA

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.960
 analyst, who would just kind of sit in the same seat, with his laptop,

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.910
 kind of, just not going anywhere, except to get a Snickers or something

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.850
 like that. My job has been varied throughout my career.
