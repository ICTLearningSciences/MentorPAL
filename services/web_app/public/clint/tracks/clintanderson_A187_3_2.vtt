The advancement potential that you have when you're in the military really

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.440
 depends on the job that you have. So I'm an Electrician's Mate,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.730
 nuclear trained. So at the end of six or eight years, many people actually

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.030
 leave the service, so because that happens there's a wide open

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.320
 range for people that want to keep progressing, because like the

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.610
 top is open, so that means that you know they train and then once they

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.910
 get to that point, because nobody  is ahead of them, then they get

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.200
 the rate. There's also lots of Electrician's Mates available, like

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.500
 jobs available. So if you're in a job that has only a few spots available,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.790
 like let's say it's a very specific job for a specific ship,

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.090
 or a job that's really really nice, really comfortable and no one wants

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.380
 to leave, then that means that those higher positions are staying

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.670
 there, they don't retire after eight years or ten years, they stay

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.970
 until twenty. That means that that's gonna block. So it would be helpful

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.260
 for you to figure out which job you're getting and try to ask

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.560
 about the advancement potential early on so that you know that you're

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.850
 in a job that can promote easily and fast.
