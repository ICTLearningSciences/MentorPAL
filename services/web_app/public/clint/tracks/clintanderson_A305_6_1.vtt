Just like with any other job there's a big political aspect to being in

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.690
 the military, a lot of it has to do with your personality so if you're

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.110
 very likable if you can make friends on the spur of the moment

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.530
 then you probably have a really good career because people want you

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.960
 to work with them, they say "oh ya know give me Chief Anderson, he's

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.380
 a good guy you know it's fun working with him." If you're gonna be

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.800
 down in the 'bilges', or you know which is like the dirty places of

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.220
 the of the ship, or if you're gonna be up on the top of the aircraft

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.640
 carrier you know working on some antenna, then the person that you're

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.060
 gonna be working with for that couple of hours you want them to be

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.480
 friendly you want to kind of have a joke you want to be able to be

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.900
 around them for several hours and not get tired, you want the time

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.320
 go fast so obviously if you're very personable then you have a higher

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.740
 chance of being being pushed forward. That being said, many people

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.170
 try to be fair you know fairness is very very pushed on all of the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.590
 leadership so give to their to their subordinates, whether you're an

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.010
 introvert whether you're an extrovert we try to grade you based on

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.430
 the the best work that you do and hopefully you get promoted that way.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.850
 Yes, favoritism does exist.
