If you're a high school student and you really don't know what comes next,

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.600
 let's say you're senior or a junior, then I would suggest that

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.970
 now would be the time to start really becoming serious, becoming motivated.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.350
  Yes you can have like a kind of shady freshman year and so-so

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.730
 sophomore year, but if people start to see that you become serious

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.100
 and that you started to really focus on your work, they're gonna give

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.470
 you the benefit of the doubt, and you can apply to many places and

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.850
 become accepted just based on your trend of upward movement.
