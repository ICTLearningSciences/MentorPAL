00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.080
The military is divided up into two parts. You have the enlisted and you

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.320
 also have the officers. Officers are people who have been to college,

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.550
 who have a degree, and who have been awarded a commission, which

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.780
 means their job is to take care of people, their job is to have a

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.020
 command underneath them. So the people that they hire are called the

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.250
 enlisted people. Enlisted people just have to have a college degree

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.480
 or, sorry not college degree, a high school degree or a GED, and then

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.720
 you're able to join the military. You're sent to a vocational school,

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.950
 it's called A school, and from that time then you are actually

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.180
 like the performer, the technical person, the person who drives the

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.420
 ship, or the person who makes the pump, or the person who checks the

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.650
 voltage. So the officers are the people in charge, the enlisted people

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.880
 are the ones who do it. So the enlisted people have a ranking from

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.120
 E1 to E9. An E1 is, it could be, well there are three types. There

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.350
 are the people that deal with aircraft things, people who deal with

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.580
 ship type things, and then people who are engineers. So the engineers

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.820
 are called firemen, the ship type people are called seamen, and

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.050
 the airforce jet type people are called airmen. So there's airmen recruit,

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.280
 then you go airman apprentice, and then you have just a regular

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.520
 airman for E3. That's E1, E2, and E3. After that, E4, E5, and E6,

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.750
 those are called petty officers, so E4 is called third class petty

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.980
 officer, E5 is second class petty officer, and E6 is first class petty

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.220
 officer. And then you have three more which is are chiefs. So I'm

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.450
 an E7 which is a chief and they have a slightly different emblem for

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.680
 their uniform. They're all gold and you can see that this is an anchor.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.920
 So if you just have this, that's a chief, if you have a star right

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.150
 here that's a E8, that's a senior chief. If you have two stars

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.380
 right here, that's a master chief. So again, E1, E2, E3, petty officer,

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.620
 third class, second class, and first class, and then chiefs: chief,

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.850
 senior chief, master chief. Officers they're their own beasts.
