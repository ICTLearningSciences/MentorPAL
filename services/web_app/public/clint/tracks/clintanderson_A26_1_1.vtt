00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.140
The work that I tend to do on a typical day actually depends on whether

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.430
 I'm deployed or not deployed. So, on deployment, then you pretty much

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.730
 are working the whole day and it's broken up into chunks. The first

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.020
 part of the day is just getting together, talking about how the

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.310
 rest of the day is going to be, do work orders. We write about the things

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.600
 that we should be doing for, maybe the next week or the next couple

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.890
 of hours or something like that. So the next chunk is we actually

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.180
 go and perform the work. So that's about another three or four hours.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.470
 The next chunk is we get back and we start doing training, so

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.770
 we make sure that we're ready for casualties that happen, if there's

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.060
 a fire, if there's a flood. Then that's about the time that you get

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.350
 off work and you have a couple of hours just to kind of relax and hang

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.640
 out but later on at night, then you do this thing called General

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.930
 Quarters which means that you come back and the whole ship pretends

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.230
 like there is a big casualty happened to the entire ship. So your days

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.520
 can go into the night. When you are not deployed and you're stationed,

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.810
 you know, stateside, then your days are a lot easier. You have

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.100
 one part of, you know, training what we want to do later on. You have

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.390
 another part of training where you just open up a book and review

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.680
 some electronics or nuclear power things and then you have a small

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.970
 part where you are just doing preventive maintenance, which means that

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.270
 you're working on a pump, make sure that's fine, opening up regulators,

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.560
 making sure you know, nothing's inside and putting new equipment

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.850
 on the ship.
