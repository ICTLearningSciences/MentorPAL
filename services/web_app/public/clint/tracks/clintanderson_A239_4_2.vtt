00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.720
Some of the changes that I see are really happening at a really fast rate.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.590
 According to Moore's law, he says that we double in our computer

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.470
 science ability every two years and it's very very apparent in a lot

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.340
 of places. One place I see, which is very specific to me, is virtual

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.210
 reality. They said that, just a couple years ago, virtual reality

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.080
 will be everywhere. Facebook bought Oculus recently and it should

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.950
 be on everybody's head pretty soon here but it hasn't turned out to

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.820
 be that way but it will. I think in a couple of years, everyone will

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.700
 be living in a virtual reality just like everyone has a PlayStation

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.570
 or Xbox back home. I also see that servers, servers is not the right

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.440
 word, maybe database administration is going to get a really big push

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.310
 forward and the reason for this is because, I think everybody is

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.180
 going to have their own virtual avatar in one way, shape or form in

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.060
 the next few years. Everybody kind of does, already with Facebook,

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.930
 they have their own website, their own profile and in that profile,

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.800
 you have a big cache of pictures, you have places where they've been,

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.670
 you have the friend connections. All of this is, like, one little

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.540
 set as a person but I think that's going to be very very expanded. Not

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.410
 only is there just going to be your picture and your name and your

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.290
 pictures, but it's also going to be, maybe, some of the applications

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.160
 that you like to use. Maybe your own personal virtual avatar who

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.030
 is dressed in a certain way. Maybe all of the shops that you like to

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.900
 buy at. And all of that, it's kind of, like Facebook times a hundred.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.770
 This is where we're going to go. So, all of that needs to be managed

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.640
 and organized. So, that field is also going to explode, I think

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.520
 a lot. The final place, I think, is probably going to be artificial

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.390
 intelligence. So, we have self-driving cars, we have Tesla with its

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.260
 new and improve, like, hybrid cars. Maybe cars that you talk to, that

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.130
 you tell them where to go and then they find the most direct route

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.000
 to the location. You have SpaceX, where you send up rockets that require

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.880
 fewer and fewer people. That means that the computing needs to

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.750
 figure out things on its own. You have machine learning where you give

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.620
 the computer simple instructions and it needs to think for itself

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.490
 to learn, how to learn so it can, like, double or quadruple or, you

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.360
 know, times a hundred their original commands so that they can figure

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.230
 out these things on itself, by itself. So, all of  these things,

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.110
 artificial intelligence, machine learning, you name it, database administration,

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.980
 pretty much, most of computer science should, you know,

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.850
 take us to newer and greater heights pretty soon.
