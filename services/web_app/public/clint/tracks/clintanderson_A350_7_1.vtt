00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.980
As far as studying abroad goes, I'm a STEM major and it was one of the

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.110
 best experiences of my life. I went to Japan when I was in undergrad,

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.240
 and I went to Japan again when I was a gradute student. I also went

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.370
 to Mexico when I was in community college, and those three moments

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.500
 stick out like sore thumbs when I think about my college careers.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.630
 That being said, so Mexico helped me because it was on my way to being

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.760
 a transfer student. But did going to Japan help me with my Berkeley

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.890
 career? Well, when I went there none of the classes counted towards

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.020
 completion of my degree, so people would say, well no, what a waste

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.150
 of time right? But number one the classes that I took were computer

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.280
 science based. Well one was science and technology in Japan and the

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.420
 other was a C++ class and coding concepts and you know none of those

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.550
 had anything to do with like making me closer to graduation, but

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.680
 they improve myself as a person. But more than that, college is not

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.810
 just about getting that degree and the fastest way there, it's about

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.940
 developing yourself as a person, and even if I went to Japan just

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.070
 to study flowers and do bonsai cutting, I'm pretty sure that that situation

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.200
 would make me a better person later on down the route. You might

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.330
 remember Steve Jobs, he was the CEO of Apple, and he said that

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.460
 taking caligraphy classes helped him so much later on in his future

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.590
 career as a computer science businessman. So I think studying abroad

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.720
 is one of those experiences that you can have that really develops

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.850
 you as a person.
