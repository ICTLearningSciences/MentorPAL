00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.950
The difference is the reserves is just what it says. It's a reserve status.That

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.050
 means that if there's a war, you're one of the first people

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.150
 that they would call, rather than civilians to go fight the war. And

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.250
 the reason that they do that is because they know that you've been

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.350
 trained. The two days per month, two weeks per year, during that time

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.450
 they train you so that you know your job very well. If you're an

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.550
 electrician, like I was, then they're going to teach you how to operate

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.650
 in a military structure when you're back home. Or when they send

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.750
 you to different places during those two weeks per year, so for instance,

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.850
 I go to New Hampshire from my home in California. So when you

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.950
 go over there, then they actually put you on a ship. And then you're

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.050
 actually doing real, active duty physical work.  So you get trained

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.150
 both places. Back home, I learn what a chief does and how he interacts

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.250
 with people. And when I go on my two week annual training, then

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.350
 I actually learn what an electrician does. So when a war happens,

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.450
 then I'm one of the first people that they call. We get paid the exact

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.550
 amount for the time that we're in. In fact, they pay us a little

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.650
 bit more, because they realize that they're taking us from our normal

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.750
 civilian job. However, for the most part, it's active duty service,

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.850
 part time.
