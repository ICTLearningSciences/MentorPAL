00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.900
So, the fairness in the Navy, it, I have to say that the military is fair.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.950
 However, they have some intricacies that I have to say. So, for

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.990
 instance, let's say the economy does poorly. Then the President is

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.040
 to blame. Now, no one's going to say, well, "You know, President, you

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.090
 are the one that caused that entire city to be downgraded." It wasn't

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.140
 his job, you know, like, maybe it's the President before him. However,

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.180
 he takes responsibility for it. So, there's a lot of responsibility

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.230
 taking for things that you don't directly control but because

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.280
 it was under your guidance, you are the one that, who people look to,

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.330
 whether it was your fault or not. So, if for instance, my military

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.370
 unit has many people that aren't physically fit, then they're going

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.420
 to say, "Chief, what is wrong with your unit?" Now, I don't have any

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.470
 excuse. I could say, well, "You know, I tell them to work out and

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.520
 they just don't listen." I could grab them by the collar and like,

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.560
 try to run with them but in the end, the people that are working for

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.610
 you, it's their, it's under their cognizance and you just take responsibility

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.660
 for it. So, is that fair? In many cases, you might not think

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.710
 that it is fair but that's the system that we play by and as long

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.750
 as you're familiar with those rules, then that kind of motivates you

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.800
 to be more involved in the things that you're supervising, to make

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.850
 sure that they go right.
