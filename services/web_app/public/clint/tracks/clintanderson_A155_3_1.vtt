00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.630
So the Navy did provide some opportunities for me to live overseas, I

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.420
 just never like really capitalized on it. So my job is a nuclear technician,

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.200
 and unfortunately we're only allowed to stay domestic. However

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.980
 they do give you opportunities to change your roles. Not your job,

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.760
 I'll always be an Electrician's Mate, but your roles throughout your

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.550
 career, they understand that they can't just put somebody on a boat

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.330
 you know for twenty years and think that he'll retire. He'll go

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.110
 crazy, right? So after your tour of maybe four years, then they provide

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.890
 you some opportunities to do different type of work. So they can

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.680
 send you to a shore command, let's say in San Diego where you can kinda

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.460
 like just chill at one of the facilities there, no boats, just

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.240
 a nine to five job. They also, they offered me to go to Italy to work

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.020
 on a sub tender, which is kinda like being on a little boat, you get

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.810
 lots of port calls and stuff so that's one opportunity to go overseas,

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.590
 but if you do like four years on an aircraft carrier, then a couple

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.370
 more years on another boat, that's a lot of sea time. So that

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.150
 was one opportunity for me. They also had another aircraft carrier that

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.940
 was stationed in Japan, it was called the USS Kitty Hawk. However

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.720
 it like, that's where I was going to go, I was in camp like let you

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.500
 know four places in America or send me to Japan? I'm going to Japan,

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.280
 that's where I'm going to go you know, but nah unfortunately we weren't

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.070
 able to go on that. No nukes go on the Kitty Hawk anymore, so

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.850
 we were just on domestic soil for that whole time, dangit.
