When it comes to learning a new task, it really depends on which career

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.260
 path I'm on to dictate, like, how much time I spend. So, for the military,

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.970
 I try not to spend so much time learning new tasks on my own

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.670
 time. There are many opportunities that you're not doing anything.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.380
 For instance, when you are on a watch and everything's fine with the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.090
 plants, where they suggest, "Hey, pick up a book and start reading

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.790
 yourself." So, those are opportunities to learn, not on my own free

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.500
 time. However, in the civilian side, where I'm a computer science programmer,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.200
 almost all of the big major learning that I do, is on my

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.910
 free time. Besides homework in college, for my actual job, during your

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.610
 working hours you're expected to actually do your work and if you

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.320
 want to improve yourself, if you want to learn another computer science

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.030
 language, if you want to learn a new tool, if you want to learn

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.730
 new software, then almost all of it is on your own time. So, that could

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.440
 be, during my most intensive phases, could be one or two hours

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.140
 at the end of the day, non-working time that I spend improving my own

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.850
 knowledge.
