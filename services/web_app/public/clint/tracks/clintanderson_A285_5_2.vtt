00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.100
The personal education that I've done really set me up to be successful

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.350
 in my future career. Number one it gave me the knowledge that I needed.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.600
 Yes I could have, so for computer science I could've taken a book

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.850
 and learned it on my own, and I did do that. I could have opened

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.100
 up my computer and took online classes, and I did do that, but there

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.350
 really is a different style of learning that you go through when you're

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.600
 listening from a lecture and then you have other teammates, other

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.850
 peers that you're working on to solve a big group project. So for

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.100
 instance, I'm taking game development at the University of Southern

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.350
 California and we made our own game. Now it would have been very very

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.600
 difficult for me to do that all on my own. The artwork that's involved,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.850
 the production that's involved, the design that's involved,

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.100
 the programming. Just by myself, I think it would have been, for the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.350
 game that I created, it's a really big one, it would be too much for

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.600
 me to do by myself. What I needed was a group of ten other people,

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.850
 or twenty other people, sometimes even thirty other people, to all

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.100
 come together to create this one lasting project that I can call my

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.350
 own that was in a safe environment like a community college class. So

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.600
 that would have been very very difficult to do my own, and that's

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.850
 how my college helped prepare me for my future job.
