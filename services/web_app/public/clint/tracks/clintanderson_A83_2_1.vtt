00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.700
Some of the priorities that I would suggest for someone entering the field,

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.550
 well, me personally, once I found out that I was going to become

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.400
 a nuke, become a nuclear technician, I guess I wasn't going to, for

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.250
 about seven months or eight months, so I took some community college

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.100
 classes to, kind of, brush up on some of the physics, some of the

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.950
 math and I have to tell you, that was a very big benefit. I didn't

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.800
 know anything about physics, like, for instance, I didn't know like,

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.650
 what happened with gravity and shooting bullets and stuff and some

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.500
 common things that I would have gotten wrong but because I took those

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.350
 college classes, that helped me prepare myself better to do well

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.200
 in A school. Because I did well in A school that, you know, like, set

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.050
 me off on a big career path later on. But it's not just like, nuclear

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.900
 technician, it could be, for instance, electronics technician. You

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.750
 might want to brush up on some of your voltage and your current and

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.600
 your resistors. You could be a cook. You might want to brush up on,

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.450
 like, the different specialties of the flavors that you're going

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.300
 to be using or you know, ask some other cooks out there, like, "What

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.150
 does it take to be good at my job?" So, just kind of understand the

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.000
 field that you're going into and try to learn about as much of it as

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.850
 you can beforehand.
