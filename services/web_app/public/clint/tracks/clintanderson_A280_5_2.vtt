00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.990
The Navy gave me an opportunity to explore the world. I've been to mostly

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.140
 Asian places, Asian oriented places because my ship was stationed

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:19.280
 in San Diego, so that means we have to go a little bit more west.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.420
 So I went so Hong Kong, Malaysia, Kuwait, Japan, Hawaii. I've been to

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.560
 Singapore, I've been to Australia, a couple of places Hobart, Perth.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.710
 I've also been to Kuwait and Bahrain, also Dubai. I'm really happy

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.850
 with the things that I've been.
