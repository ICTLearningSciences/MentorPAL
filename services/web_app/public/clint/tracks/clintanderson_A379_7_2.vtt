00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.090
Right now, I'm in Japan to better develop myself as a person. There are

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.330
 a lot of things in Japan that I really like and that I really missed

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.570
 cause I used to be here before. So I'm here now, number one, to teach

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.810
 English to students. I teach them pretty simple English. It's to

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.050
 middle school kids and elementary school kids, so the English that

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.290
 I'm teaching is not very difficult. However I'm developing myself as

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.530
 a good teacher. I'm learning some skills that you know I wouldn't

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.770
 have learned otherwise just by tutoring, just by talking one-on-one

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.010
 back in the States. Number two, I'm experiencing the food and the culture

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.250
 and the life and the language of Japan, and I needed that because,

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.490
 I guess, going to school all the time, studying computer science,

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.730
 you kinda get drained. So this is kinda like my break to experience

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.970
 someting new, something worldwide and Japan is really great for that.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.210
 Number three, the payment here is pretty, pretty decent. It's not,

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.450
 you know, outstanding but as a student, you know, year after year

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.690
 after year USC is pretty expensive, so I actually came here and I've

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.930
 been saving up a little bit of money. It's going to help me, so I

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.170
 don't have to worry about that so much when I go back. Number four,

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.410
 I'm here because I really wanted to focus on, you know, give a lot

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.650
 more effort to my startup. I'm a part of a virtual reality startup that's

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.890
 trying to produce their first game. And if I'm in USC maybe I

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.130
 really have to focus on my studies, so I wanted to take a break so I

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.370
 can really get my hands dirty with my startup. And we're doing really

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.610
 well with it. So there's many reasons why I'm in Japan, but the best

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.850
 reason is probably because I love this place.
