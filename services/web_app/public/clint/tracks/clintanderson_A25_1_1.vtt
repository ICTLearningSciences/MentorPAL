So, when you're not deployed, life is actually pretty good. So, the military

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.700
 comes in waves. Our hard time is when we go on deployment. That's

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.620
 when you give it your all, that's when you're working the hardest

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.540
 but when you come back then they kind of go easy on you. So, well

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.470
 actually, I was living in San Diego. This is an example from when I

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.390
 was down there and our days were pretty early so that we fight the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.310
 rush hour traffic. I think they began at six and then noon, that's when

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.230
 we normally have our lunch but they just send us home. So, days

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.160
 are cut short at six hours and so you just like, actually it's five

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.080
 hours because the traffic is the thing that cuts most of the morning.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.000
 So, days are from seven to noon and then you split and go home and

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.930
 go see your family. So, you have a lot more time sometimes when you

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.850
 get off deployment.
