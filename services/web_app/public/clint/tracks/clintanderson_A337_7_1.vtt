00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.910
The recommended path that you should take if you want to go to school

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.970
 and you know that that's really in your future, I would think that the

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:16.040
 number one thing to do if you're kind of managerial oriented would

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.100
 be try to become an officer. That means that the Navy could pay for

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.160
 your education while you're in school, and so you can have a free

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.230
 education, and then you can start the Navy making a higher salary and

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.290
 doing jobs that are much more high tech because the they demand that

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.350
 college degree. The second path is the path that I kind of took,

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.410
 which is you serve out your military path, at the end of it then you

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.470
 get the Montgomery GI bill, in my case, for older people. Or you can

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.540
 get the Post-9/11 GI Bill. They both pay incredible sums of money,

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.600
 most of the time they pay for your college tuition fully. If you go

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.660
 to a private school, then in many cases it can be free or paid for,

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.730
 and at that time, because you're in the reserves or you just got out

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.790
 of the military completely, you can, you can use the Navy's past work

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.850
 to kind of fill in, to get the rest your college degree.
