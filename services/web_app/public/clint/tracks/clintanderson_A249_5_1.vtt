00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.070
STEM has lots of jobs. Do you need to be good at science or math or another

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.290
 difficult school class to be good at it? Well it depends on what

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.520
 you want to do. If you're looking at going into NASA, the physicists

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.740
 there they know their stuff very well, they're trained for, they

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.960
 have lots of experience with it. So the answer for them is yes. However,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.180
 I think that almost every single one of them had to start from

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.410
 somewhere and that somewhere wasn't very, wasn't extremely difficult.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.630
 Yes there are some geniuses at NASA. Yes there will be some geniuses

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.850
 wherever you work, if you're in the STEM field. However, most of

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.070
 them are just like you and me. Most of them were pretty bright in high

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.290
 school, they tried, they know how to study, they know how to open

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.520
 a book and read, and most of it is boring to them. Some of it it's

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.740
 not. Some of it is interesting and as long as you have that interest,

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.960
 that passage to do what every job you're doing, well then the intelligence

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.180
 will come later on. You'll have enough people around you to

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.410
 guide you in the right direction, to kind of fill in your gaps of

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.630
 knowledge, and I think it just takes time rather than a strong math

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.850
 skill and science skill to get to where you're going.
