00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.470
An early role model for me would have been, his name is Ronald Jester,

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.090
 he was a GM mechanic. I was, I guess freshman, sophomore in high school

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.700
 and he is somebody that found me at one of the buildings that I

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.320
 was that. I was speaking German with my brother and because I used

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.940
 to live in Germany, I could speak it, you know, like, a little bit and

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.560
 he was, you know, German origin. He went to German church and he's

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.170
 downstairs in the basement of this building, you know, kind of, tutoring

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.790
 other black kids and he was very interested and like, "Hey, I

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.410
 hear the language of my family. What is this, you know, in this place?"

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.030
 and he was like, "Those two black kids over there are talking."

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.640
 That really freaked him out. "So, tell me about your story" and we

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.260
 kind of told him about where we lived and about our mom and our dad

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.880
 and, you know, how we bounced around from place to place and spoke a

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.500
 little bit of German. So, he could understand that we're kind of bright.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.110
 So, he said, "Hey, you know, why don't you come over to my place?

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.730
 You know, come to our German church" and, you know, like, and he

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.350
 introduced us around and that's how it started. So, his family was

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.970
 white, his mom and dad obviously really raised him to be, you know,

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.590
 a very respectable young man in the community. You know, he had his

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.200
 own house, he was 26. Three bedroom house and it was really nice and

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.820
 clean and you know, it's something that we really weren't used to,

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.440
 you know, back in my family. I guess I had my sister, she was ten years

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.060
 older than me, she was 26 as well, you know, she had a couple of

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.670
 kids and my mom, you know, she was divorced, so, like, it was all of

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.290
 us living in this one house and, you know it's like really cramped

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.910
 and it wasn't exactly dirty but it was very, in an impoverished area

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.530
 but he lived in Grand Blanc, Michigan which is a nicer part of, you

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.140
 know, Michigan and, you know, everyone has gone to college and the

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.760
 church, you know, everyone was like a community. It's very, two different

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.380
 aspects of life. So, that's the first person that I actually

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.000
 saw that really inspired me, really taught me the difference between

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.610
 what education is and what your life could be if you didn't have education.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.230
 So, you could say that he was one of my first role models.
