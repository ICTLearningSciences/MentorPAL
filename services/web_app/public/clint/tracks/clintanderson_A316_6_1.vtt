There are tons of good websites that you can find as long as they're reliable

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.050
 a couple of my favorites are "navy.mil" and "navy.gov" but like

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.650
 I said you can just do any Google search and put in "Army" "Navy"

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.250
 "STEM careers" and chances are the first to pop up should be pretty

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.850
 good for you.
