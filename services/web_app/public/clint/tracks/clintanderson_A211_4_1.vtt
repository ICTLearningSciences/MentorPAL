00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.380
The difference between working in the public and private sector, I would

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.910
 say would probably be, number one, the job security. If you're a

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.440
 public servant, it's very hard to get fired. That's a pretty common

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.970
 meme that we always say. You'd have to do something really terrible

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.500
 to be fired. You can not be promoted as much or you can get like pretty

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.030
 bad jobs but once you're in the system then you don't really get

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.560
 kicked out because of all the fairness laws in place. If you're in

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.090
 the private sector, then you have to realize that their main goal is

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.610
 to make money. That's the point of a business, to make money. So, number

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.140
 one, if you're not producing, if you're in the public sector,

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.670
 you just get kind of shifted around and if you're in the private sector,

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.200
 you get fired. So, you have to have a better work ethic, I think.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.730
 So, for instance, in the public sector, there could be many days

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.260
 that you kind of just sit around, kind of with your hands in your pocket,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.790
 especially if there's not that much work. You have high work and

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.320
 low work and during low work, then you're just not expected to do

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.850
 that much whereas in the private sector, they will find something for

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.380
 you to do because they're paying you. Otherwise, they'll just lay

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.910
 you off or something. So, it's two different reasons that you exist.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.440
 For the public, your main goal is to serve the people and they want

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.970
 you to keep your job. They want to have the same workforce in play

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.500
 most of the time, so it doesn't really matter how the, what the job

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.030
 outlook is like. You're probably keep your job if they like your work

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.560
 experience and you're just kind of, sit there whereas the private

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.090
 sector, if they're doing bad, then you're doing bad and, you know,

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.610
 you have to maintain a good reputation, you have to, kind of, be smart

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.140
 and if you want to be promoted, then you have to, like, really show

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.670
 your worth more in the private sector. However, at least in the private

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.200
 sector, you get to make a lot more money. You're not on the federal

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.730
 pension system, you're not on the federal salary system. So,

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.260
 depending on what type of job you want to do in the private sector,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.790
 you can make lots of money. I know some people who, like, can buy a

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.320
 house with the bonus that they just got, so, there's some value in that.
