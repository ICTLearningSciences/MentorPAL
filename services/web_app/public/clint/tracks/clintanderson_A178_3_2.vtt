When you think about your future career computer science could be one

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.290
 of the funnest things that you can do. I know for me I took some english classes

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.520
 in college and math classes and lots of other classes.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.740
 And the one that I actually wanted to do homework for, the one that

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.960
 I finished the homework assignment and I wanted to keep working on it

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.180
 afterwards despite what the you know, despite my grade, despite you

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.410
 know like whether I did good on it or not, and despite whether I'd be

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.630
 graded on it or not, it was computer science. That's one of the

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.850
 only ones that affected me like that. If you want to maybe make your

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.070
 own business with your laptop based on things that are in your mind,

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.290
 things that you're coming up with on the fly, then computer science

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.520
 would be a good choice. If you want to be in the music industry and

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.740
 work on like different sounds and processes and, I guess computer

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.960
 science has a has a big deal with music as well and movies as well.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.180
 My job for my major at University of Southern California is game development,

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.410
 and as it turns out, games are actually more, turn out more

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.630
 profit than movies nowadays. So if you like games, then computer science

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.850
 could be the way to go as well.
