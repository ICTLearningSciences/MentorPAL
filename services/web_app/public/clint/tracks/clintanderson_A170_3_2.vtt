00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.230
The field that you want to work in is specifically guided by how well

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.620
 you did on the test. So basically you rate. So it's very important to

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.000
 kind of, if you do want to work in a demanding field, to try to score

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.390
 as high as you can. If you don't get the job you want when you tried

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.770
 first tried, then before you join try to you know bump it up a

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.160
 little bit you know, to try to get that job. So once you're in the military,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.540
 then there's gonna be a big range of jobs that you can do.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.930
 You can work in the library, you can work you know with electrical components,

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.310
 at least for me as an Electrician's Mate I had a wide range

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.700
 of things that I could do. So if you're trying to ask which job I

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.080
 can do, which job can I apply for, a lot of it's kind of political.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.470
 A lot of it's well you know like we've known him for a while, he's

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.850
 been on the ship for a long time so like he has a choice. Since you

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.230
 just come to the ship then like this is the only job that we have for

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.620
 you you know. You could be painting this deck or scrubbing this floor,

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.000
 right that's the job that we have for you. But if you've been in

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.390
 for a lot longer then you have a little bit of leeway in asking for

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.770
 jobs, and again you know within your rate, it depends on how high

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.160
 you score. So for instance there's going to be people who will be providing

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.540
 work to other people who are going to be writing it down, writing

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.930
 their job descriptions down and providing it. We need those people

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.310
 to be some of the brightest so if you don't have a good work history,

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.700
 then you might not be able to apply for for that job. So number

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.080
 one try to score as high as possible, and number two try to learn

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.470
 on the job as much as possible, and that's how you can get the best

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.850
 job that you want.
