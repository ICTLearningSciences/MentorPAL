00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.590
Are great practitioners of this field made or born? I would say that it's

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.330
 a little bit of both. Now, there's some psychology here. I do believe

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.070
 that when you're born, you have certain innate abilities, comes

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.810
 from your mom and your dad, comes from your race. Some of us are different

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.550
 skinned, some of us are taller or shorter, some of us are,

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.280
 you know, stronger based on your genes and I also think that, like,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.020
 your mind is, it follows the same trait, you know, like everybody's

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.760
 different. Some people are artists when they're born, some people are

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.500
 engineers when they're born. However it depends on how you grow up.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.240
 So, you can take someone who's an artist as a kid and then you can

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.980
 train them through their lives to become a great engineer. Now, maybe

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.720
 they might not be the best engineer because it's not in their bodies

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.460
 but they can do a good job, a great job in fact. So, it's a combination

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.200
 of both. It depends on who your mom and your dad were. Hopefully,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.940
 you got that training, whatever training that you want to be and

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.680
 later on in your life but if you don't, the military, who realizes

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.420
 this, can train anybody to do anything. So, some people will have

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.150
 to do a lot more work to achieve their goals. Some people can, for instance,

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.890
 join the nuclear field like I am and it can be a breeze for

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.630
 them. Some people might have to put in the work, but regardless of

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.370
 that fact, they can take anybody, whether you're an expert from birth

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.110
 or whether you need to put some time in it and they'll make sure that

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.850
 you do the pipeline so that you can do the job well.
