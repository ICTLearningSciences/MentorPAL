When I first joined the military I thought, okay, I'm going to be exercising

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.850
 all day and I'm gonna be shooting guns all night but fortunately,

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.850
 neither of those really came to pass. You do have some time to

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.850
 exercise but as far as shooting guns, it's not really something that's

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 really popular here. Especially when you're out on deployment, which

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.850
 is six months in the middle of the ocean. Some people, the military

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.850
 police, the MPs, they have guns but it's not like they're practicing

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.850
 all the time you know, like it's, they practice back at shore.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.850
 And when you're on shore, I basically do my job as an Electrician's

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 Mate, it's not like I can practice. But there are opportunities to practice,

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.850
 there are shooting ranges that people go to, and I won my ribbons,

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.850
 in fact.
