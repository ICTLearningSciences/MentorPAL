00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.880
If I'm going to talk about college then I really have to put it into perspective

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.910
 of a normal nine to five job. That's what I always compared

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.940
 it to, normal nine to five job, you wake up nine o'clock to do the

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.960
 same thing, it's lots of work, there's lots of repetition, sometimes

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.990
 for my jobs until five o'clock and you go home pretty tired. College

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.020
 on the other hand, it's, number one it's very sporadic. On Mondays

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.050
 I have one class in the morning. On Tuesdays I have a class in the

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.080
 morning and then a night class in the evening. On Wednesdays I have

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.110
 three classes in a row but they're only one hour long and they're

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.140
 just all over the place and that's the first thing, that the schedule

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.160
 is different. The second thing is that each of those classes you know

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.190
 for a fact is going to be different. They're not gonna teach the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.220
 same thing that they taught three weeks ago and then two weeks ago

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.250
 and then this week. You know you're on a different chapter, gonna be

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.280
 learning different things. If you're in chemistry you're gonna be working

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.310
 with different beakers. If you're in a robotics class you're

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.340
 gonna be working with robots this weekend and then the legs next week.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.360
 Every single week is very, very different. The third thing is that

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.390
 it's challenging. So, in my nine to five jobs I'm either flipping

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.420
 burgers or I'm selling popcorn. Even with the harder jobs, you can be

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.450
 in a situation that it's very, very similar week to week, and because

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.480
 it's so similar, it's not very challenging. But with college, depending

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.510
 on how good you want to do, and of course I say if you wanna

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.540
 go to college you wanna ramp up your difficulty as much as possible,

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.560
 then you're gonna be challenged all the time. You're gonna have projects

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.590
 that you are gonna be working on overnight-you don't have that

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.620
 in a normal nine to five job. You're gonna be coming in on the weekends

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.650
 voluntarily-you don't have that with a normal nine to five job.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.680
 You're gonna be working with different people and not knowing the

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.710
 answer and asking around and opening up books. You're actually gonna

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.740
 be going to the library for a purpose, not just to read Greek mythology.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.760
 You don't have that in a nine to five job. So comparatively, I

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.790
 think those are the main differences, it's more challenging, the time

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.820
 is different, and there's a lot more room to explore your passion.
