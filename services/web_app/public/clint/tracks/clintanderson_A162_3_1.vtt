00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.560
You can receive a cash bonus if you enlist depending on the needs of the

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.280
 Navy. So if we're about to fight a war, or if we're in the middle

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.990
 of a war, then you can expect that they're trying to increase the size

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.710
 of the military, and for that then they provide a bonus. If there,

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.420
 if it's kinda peacetime or if they're downsizing the Navy, then obviously

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.140
 they offer less. So it's a size shaping tool that the Navy

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.850
 has to get people to come in and leave. With that said, in most cases

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.560
 for their advanced jobs, they almost always have some kind of incentive.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.280
 It ranges in the amount, but it's there nonetheless. So the amount

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.990
 that I received, they gave me the choice, they said I could have

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.710
 $12,000 in cash, you know minus taxes, or you could have a really

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.420
 big educational bonus. It was $50,000. So I knew I was going to go

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.140
 to college and I wanted to make sure that I didn't you know like spend

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.850
 the money early so I said give me the educational bonus at the end.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.560
 A lot of people that I knew like I guess the first year I was in

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.280
 you know, people had new cars they put down payments on like nice musical

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.990
 equipment and stuff like that. So some other jobs that you could

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.710
 have that provide bonuses, are obviously a lot of the STEM jobs.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.420
 So there's Electrician's Mate, that's not inside the nuclear field but

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.140
 just regular electricians. There's Fire Controlmen FC's. So those

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.850
 are the ones who fix like all of the, from the engineering plants up.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.560
 That mean's like the top part of the ship, not dealing with the nuclear

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.280
 side, just from engineering and up you know. They have to be

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.990
 pretty bright too, so they get bonuses. And Cryptological Technicians

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.710
 that learn languages, they're the spies, the ones who like listen,

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.420
 try to find out what foreign people are are up to, they get cash bonuses.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.140
 So jobs like that, they're the ones who tend to get the biggest

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.850
 bonuses.
