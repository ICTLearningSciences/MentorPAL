00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.610
I've had several internships, my favorite one would probably be my first

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.370
 one. I was working for the, for the Navy we're at the Naval training

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.140
 center in Orlando, Florida, it was right beside Disney and it was

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.900
 my first one so I think that that was one of the main reasons that

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.660
 I chose this to be my favorite one because you get that "oh I'm I'm

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.420
 new in in this new place and I'm actually going to be using my major

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.180
 to do something important and around me all the smart people" you

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.950
 know. You have all that like wow and wonderment you know because it's

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.710
 your first experience. I was doing something pretty cool I was working

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.470
 on a, so the marines they sit with their guns and they can actually

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.230
 go to the real field and actually shoot people and have helicopters

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.990
 drop things or they can do it virtually. So what they do is like

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.750
 they sit in front of a screen and instead of being out there in the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.520
 real world, they actually talk to a computer and you say something

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.280
 like "drop illumination five yards east" or something and then the

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.040
 computer does it. But the computer doesn't really understand it completely

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.800
 because if speak for a long time then it starts to get confused.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.560
 So my job was to kind of fix that, and every day I was learning

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.330
 something new, I was talking to smart people who were really like making

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.090
 me a better computer science major and it was really cool. A really

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.850
 cool two to three months.
