My favorite coding language has to be C# so far. If you get into computer

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:12.320
 science, all of your instructors are going to say, "You can learn

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.060
 any language. It doesn't matter which one it is. They're all the same",

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.800
 which is, you know, it's true in a sense. So, C# for me, has been

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.530
 the easiest language to learn. Yes, all computer science languages

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:35.270
 are very very similar but some are easier to learn than others and

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.010
 it's because I like that for purpose. I think everything, from cars

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.740
 to airplanes, everything that's been created has a curve where it

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.480
 should be easier, the later it is in its cycle. So, when computers first

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.220
 came around, everybody was working with vacuum tubes, you know,

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.960
 physical things. Then, it became assembly language, then it became

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.690
 machine language, then it became A, then B, then C, then C#, then Python

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.430
 and Java. So, the later languages I think are based on the ones

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:21.170
 before and they said, "Hey, how can we make this easier?" and it just

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.900
 got better and better and better. So, for me, C#, it sounds like

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.640
 someone's talking, it sounds like, by sound I mean, you look at the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.380
 code and it says "If Bob is". Anyways, it's really easy to read once

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.110
 you're reading the code and earlier versions I think are not as user-friendly.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.850
 So, C# is the language for me.
