00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.640
I like a lot of the pop movies like Titanic, Braveheart, Forrest Gump

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.420
 like a lot of the blockbusters but I have to say that my favorite movie

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.210
 of all time is actually not even a movie, it's an anime from Japan.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.990
 I'm in Japan so I you see lots of anime and many of them are good

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.780
 but one blows everything out the water. Berserk is a movie about the

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.560
 medieval times, and there's this character Guts who is really strong

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.350
 and you know he wants to fight his own personal battles by himself

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.140
 but not really think about anything, no purpose but he meets this

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.920
 person Griffin who's very charismatic and he has this huge goal to like

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.710
 own his own kingdom and Guts sees this so he follows him and you

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.490
 know there's lots of romance, lots of blood and guts, lots of intellectual

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.280
 conversation, and believe it or not I actually thought a lot

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.060
 about my own life very much throughout this movie, so hats off to

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.850
 those guys who made that really bright anime.
