00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.300
So, deployment life can be pretty hard sometimes. Most of the time you're

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.750
 working. I'd say about 75% of most days you're either going to work

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.200
 or coming from work or you know, sitting down preparing to go for

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.650
 work in a few hours. But, there is time to relax. So, many people,

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.100
 they join bands, they watch DVDs from the recreation center that we

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.550
 have there, they sit around and play cards, they kind of just sit and

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.000
 if it's later on at night, then you sleep, although like during the

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.450
 work day, you're not supposed to sleep at all. So, I remember my

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.900
 days would be, I would wake up at about 6:50, I would be in group, in

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.350
 formation at 7. It's only ten minutes I know, but you learn to be

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.800
 very very quick and then you're working until four o'clock. And from

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.250
 that point on, you could stand watch which would be another six hours

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.700
 after that, at least for me. Some people don't stand watch, some

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.150
 people do, its about half-half. Or you could be doing these trainings

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.600
 that come later on that night, they're called General Quarters. We

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.050
 were fighting a war, so they pretend like a bomb hit us or there's

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.500
 some kind of chemical spill or things that make you, that keep you on

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.950
 your feet to make sure that you have all the skills that you need

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.400
 to fight the casualty. So, short answer, you're working pretty much

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.850
 all day.
