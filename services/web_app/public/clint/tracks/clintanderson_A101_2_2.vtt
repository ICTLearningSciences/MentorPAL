00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.080
The major problem that I see military people having working in the field

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.310
 today is that they can probably expect to go to more wars if our

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:16.540
 current leadership doesn't take the right actions to prevent that. We're

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.770
 supposed to be policing the world in a way that prevents large

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.000
 drawn out wars but unfortunately, with a lot of things that are happening

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.230
 in the Yellow Sea right now, with a lot of things happening with

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.470
 North Korea with their buildup of their weapon arsenal, with some

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.700
 the things going on in the Middle East. We can see that the policing

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.930
 that we're doing isn't fully effective in the way that we are seeing

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.160
 decreases in the level of violence around the world. We are seeing

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.390
 the same or even more than when I was in the military, so that could

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.620
 be something that we can look forward to in the military from now

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.850
 on.
