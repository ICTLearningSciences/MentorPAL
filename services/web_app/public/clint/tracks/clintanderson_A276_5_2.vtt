What you see in video games can be similar to what you'll experience depending

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.710
 on which service you join. I joined the Navy, and I don't think

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.640
 that there are that many video games out there that really showcase

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.560
 the Navy life. A lot of it is taking care of equipment, and I don't

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.490
 think that that's so, I don't think anyone has made the right video

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.420
 game that shows the fun in doing that. What they do show is the

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.350
 combat situations that army people and marine people experience. I've

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.280
 never experienced it myself, but I can imagine what it's like. I

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.210
 have experienced boot camp, I've experienced walking around, I've seen

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.140
 it themselves, and I've heard it based on the stories that they've

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.060
 told me, and for the most part, it can be true, especially in wartime.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.990
 I'm not saying that that's fun, but I think that the video game

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.920
 simulations that we have are very similar to the life that is shown,

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.850
 that I've seen.
