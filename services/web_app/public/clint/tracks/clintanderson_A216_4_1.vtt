It's really interesting that, for the STEM field, there are fewer females

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.530
 than men. I was just talking to my friend the other day and we were

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.370
 just saying, "At least when I was in school, girls actually did

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.210
 better than guys in math and science. I mean, they're the ones who are

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.050
 always submitting their homework, you know, always got the best grades,

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.890
 maybe guys, kind of, just, like, sit back and don't really, like,

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.730
 pay much attention. So, you think that girls would be in abundance

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.570
 in STEM but it turns out to be the opposite. After you get into

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.410
 college, it switches. Girls are mostly humanities and guys are mostly,

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.250
 you know, technically oriented and I think it has to do with just

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.090
 the mindset of girls, I guess. Maybe because so many guys are in the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.930
 technical roles, then maybe girls get to college and think, "Well,

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.770
 you know, those technical jobs are for guys. So, let me go ahead and,

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.610
 you know, do something humanities oriented, because it's like that

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.450
 already." So, I think if we just, like, reset, if we, like, kick everyone

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.290
 out of college and then all of a sudden, you know, we have a

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.130
 fresh batch of people in and, you know, we don't tell people who's

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.970
 running NASA, who's running Microsoft, you know, it's all a secret.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.810
 Then, I think maybe it would be about half-half, you know, there'd be

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.650
 half as many girls at MIT as guys but because, you know, maybe they

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.490
 step foot on MIT and say, "Okay, well, you know, like what jobs do

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.330
 you have? Oh well, I'm looking at electrical engineering. Oh, 70% guys.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.170
 Alright, well maybe that's a guy thing, a guy profession" and it

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.010
 shouldn't be that way because, obviously girls are just as smart,

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.850
 if not more smart than guys coming out of high school.
