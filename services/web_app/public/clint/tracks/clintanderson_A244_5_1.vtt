00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.510
The branch of service that you should join really depends on the type

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.160
 of person that you are. Now, I have to say that they all have very similar

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.820
 jobs. So, you can pretty much join any of them and find something

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.480
 that you like. However, that's about the limit of their comparison

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.140
 because for instance, if you join the Navy, let's say as a cook,

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.790
 you could be on an aircraft carrier going around Italy and Germany

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.450
 and Spain. If you join the Air Force as a cook, then you might be stationed

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.110
 on one base, Travis Air Force Base and that's where you work,

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.760
 that's where you stay, you don't really get to travel so much. You

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.420
 won't be stationed someplace else. Now, there are army bases, military

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.080
 bases, navy bases, airforce bases all over the world. So, your opportunity

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.740
 to travel to foreign places is wide open with any service

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.390
 that you join. However, many of them don't have that much forward progression

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.050
 as far as your career. For instance, from what I hear, the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.710
 Air Force doesn't really promote as well as some of the, really traveling

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.360
 military services like the Marines, like the Navy and in fact,

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.020
 many people join the Air Force and stay in the Air Force for a long

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.680
 time and even though that's good for the Air Force, they don't have

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.340
 so much retention problem, it's bad for people that want to really

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.990
 progress because, for instance, if you want to become, like, an E7

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.650
 rate, which is a Chief in the Navy, you have to wait for someone else

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.310
 to either move from the military or be promoted themselves. So, for

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.960
 instance, with the Air Force, it might take a long time for those

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.620
 people to leave because, you know, the Air Force is such a great career

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.280
 progression whereas in the Navy, you have lots of rotation. So,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.940
 your chances of being promoted are really high. For the Navy, there

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.590
 are many opportunities to show your desire to really take on the hard

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.250
 jobs. So, you could be requested to go fight overseas and if you

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.910
 take that job on, then they really look high on, the people that promote

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.560
 you really look high on those opportunities whereas for other things

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.220
 like the Coast Guard and the Air Force, you might not have as

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.880
 many opportunities. So, it really depends on what's going on in the

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.540
 world, where they were at war, whether you're in a job that allows you

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.190
 to go to harder locations to serve on submarines. Things like that.
