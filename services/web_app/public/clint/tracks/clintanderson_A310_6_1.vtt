00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.180
In the military you don't really get paid based on the type of job that

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.520
 you do, for instance, all officers that are the same pay grade make

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.850
 the same money all enlisted people who are the same pay grade make

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.180
 the money those are the two types of jobs that you can do, be an officer

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.520
 if you have a degree and you choose that route or enlisted however

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.850
 there are differences in the salary within the specific pay grade

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.180
 for instance I am an E7 I'm a cheif so technically I make the same

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.520
 as other chiefs out there but you could be, for instance, on a submarine

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.850
 and you get a little bit more pay, a little bit, you can be in

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.180
 the hazardous duty area which if you're fighting a war then you get

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.520
 a little bit more pay based on that also because you're fighting that

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.850
 war you don't have to pay taxes, some taxes, so those are ways that

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.180
 you can save money even though we're the same pay grade people are

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.520
 making more money based on where they live what they're doing what

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.850
 kind of deployment they're on, if they are on one, you can even make

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.180
 a different pay check based on where you live in the country so for

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.520
 instance people in Monterey California which is an expensive area

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.850
 might make a lot more for housing than people in Virginia that's just

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.180
 one example but the cost of living is different so you have to take

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.520
 all that into consideration but the answer to the question "how much

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.850
 you make" it's all about the same based on your pay grade.
