00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.650
The biggest complaint that I have with STEM is the education that's involved.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.450
 How you present these complex situations to the people that

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.250
 want to learn about it. And I have to admit right now it's pretty terrible.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.050
 For instance programming. Programming can be easy if you have

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.850
 someone who can teach you, if you find a really good website, then

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.650
 it can be a very enjoyable experience. However, I think that there

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.450
 are many places that you can learn computer science from or ways that

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.250
 you can learn computer science that are gonna be very difficult, and

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.050
 it doesn't need to be. One of the reasons that I'm learning education

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.850
 is to make those things easy. You open up a math book and chances

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.650
 are that that math book has been taught by, has been written by one

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.450
 of the leading mathematicians. You know he's one of the top of his

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.250
 field that's why he has the authority to write this book. However,

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.050
 not all the best mathematicians make the best teachers, and I think

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.850
 specifically for engineering and for STEM, you need the best teachers,

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.650
 the best, the ones who know how to relay the information the best,

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.450
 not just the best in the field. You can be a so-so mathematician,

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.250
 but as long as you can help somebody who doesn't know about it to know

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.050
 it is well as you, then those are the people that should be teaching

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.850
 and right now that's just not the case.
