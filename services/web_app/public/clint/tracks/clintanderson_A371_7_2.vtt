00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.350
As far as age limits in the navy, to join the military service you have

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.850
 to be at least 18 if you're independent or you can join as young as

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.350
 17 if your parents allow you to. For the older age limits, it really

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.850
 differs by branch but if you're in the high 30's then there's a chance

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.350
 that you might not be able to join. But for the most part it's

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.850
 17 to around 30ish.
