00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.710
The bosses that I've had in the navy have been varied. Some of them I've

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.560
 got along with greatly but others they- in many cases it it depends

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.420
 on the type of personality that they have and just like with anyone,

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.280
 somtimes you make friends sometimes you make enemies if you can

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.140
 say that. So most people are just somewhere in the middle so the people

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.990
 that you would have a beer with in real life, those the people you

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.850
 can joke around with, those are the people that understand your personality

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.710
 and they're the ones who respect your work the best. However

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.560
 I gotta say that many people think that the military can be political,

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.420
 so for instance you could have a work center that has like four

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.280
 or five people and then you can have a supervisor for them and you

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.140
 can see that the supervisor has a better communication with you know

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.990
 two or three people in the unit. So the quiet person who barely ever

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.850
 talks to that supervisor could get frustrated in the fact that his

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.710
 work isn't being recognized the way that it should. So I've had that

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.560
 personal problem too. But it is what it is. You just take an average

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.420
 of your whole entire career. Sometimes you will be a superstar

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.280
 and sometimes you are gonna be kinda like the bottom of the list. But

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.140
 for the most part as long as you you present a good effort then you'll

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.990
 be successful. I made it to chief, so it seems like most of what

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.850
 I've been doing with my bosses has been on the positive side.
