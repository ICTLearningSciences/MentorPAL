00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.420
I first became interested in computer science when I was in community

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.990
 college. I did eight years in the navy as an active duty Electrician's

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.560
 Mate and I learned a lot about engineering, and I thought I was going

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.140
 to go to college to do electrical engineering. However, some of

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.710
 the classes that you learn with electrical engineering are computer

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.280
 science, and I went to a research internship. It wasn't an internship

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.850
 it was just research for UC Berkeley, and I thought I was going to

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.420
 do electrical engineering, but they had so many cool computer science

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.990
 topics and professors and little things around campus that really

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.560
 empowered me to kind of consider computer science as a career. So

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.140
 when I went back home, when I was done with the research and I went

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.710
 back home, I really focused on my computer science classes and I just

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.280
 realized, hey you know out of all the classes that I am learning,

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.850
 math, science, english, the computer science classes were some of the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.420
 most fun, and I just thought you know, if I want to make my own business,

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.990
 if I was doing electrical engineering I'd have to go to radio

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.560
 shack, I'd have to buy resistors, I'd have to spend lots of money,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.140
 I'd have to like spend lots of time. But with computer science, you

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.710
 have your own business right in front of you if you just open up your

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.280
 laptop. You can have a million dollar idea just opening your laptop

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.850
 and typing on some keys. So that sold me.
