00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:01.960
ROTC, also known as 'rot-see', is one of the many ways that you can become

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.070
 an officer. It's a very difficult program to get into, you have

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.180
 to be in shape, you have to be very competent and confident. You're

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.290
 gonna be looked at by many people and they're going to choose you to

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:06.410
 be an officer in the military to command troops. So, you can be active

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:07.520
 duty or reserve, and if you get selected they'll pay for your college

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.630
 education. After that then you have to stay in the military for

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:09.740
 several years, I think 4 or 5 years, and then it's one of the better

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:10.850
 ways to become an officer, it's one of most popular as well.
