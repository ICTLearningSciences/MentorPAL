When I joined and they told me I was going to be in the nuclear field,

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.310
 I have to admit, until I started going to the school itself, I did

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:16.540
 not know what a nuke was. So, did I work with nukes? The answer is no.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.770
 'Nukes' mean nuclear weapons and if you work for a submarine, for

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.000
 a ballistic submarine, then you do see the nukes but you're not the

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.230
 one who is working on them. What the nuclear field means, is that we

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.470
 work for the engineering portion of the nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.700
 So, we're the engine of the ship. If you think of a car as

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.930
 the aircraft carrier, then we're the things that make it, you know,

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.160
 go 'Boom!'. We're the thing that makes it go forth through the road

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.390
 I guess and we're the people that make electricity happen for the entire

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.620
 ship, we're the people that make the CD player run, basically we're

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.850
 the life blood of the aircraft carrier.
