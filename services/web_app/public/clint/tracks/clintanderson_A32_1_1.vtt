As soon as you join the military, probably your very first week, even

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.970
 though you're at bootcamp, so you have no access to alcohol but from

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.030
 that time,you know, all the way up until you end your career, you're

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.090
 going to be hearing about alcohol, alcohol responsibility, the fact

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.140
 that you can't drink too much, the fact that, you know, alcohol ruins

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.200
 people's lives and it's a very big thing for our culture. So, the

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.260
 Navy takes some strides to kind of change this. We get lots of training.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.320
 We get, for instance, when we go to ports, when we're on deployment,

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.380
 we have this thing called the 'buddy system', which means that

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.440
 you're not allowed to go out yourself. You actually have to tap one

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.500
 of your friends and the both of you go out to explore this new city.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.560
 They want to make sure that you don't go out there and get yourself

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.610
 into trouble by drinking too much alcohol and then having a stranger,

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.670
 you know, guide you back to the ship. There are people who would

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.730
 rob you, there are people who will, you know, do harm to you. So,

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.790
 the 'buddy system' is probably the Navy's biggest way to combat alcohol

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.850
 misuse.
