00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.660
For me particularly, I chose the Navy as a career because it seemed like

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.470
 a very easy and straight forward step to begin a career. So at the

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.290
 time I was just graduated from high school, I was working at McDonalds,

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.100
 and you know various odd jobs, Swap Meet, a movie theater, used

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.910
 to sell knives, used to sell home alarm systems, I was bouncing all

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.730
 over the place. And I kept coming back to the thinking you know what,

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.540
 the military is a good way to start. I knew about their money for

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.350
 education, I knew about, after you do your tour you could have a really

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.160
 good professional career outside of the military you know. So

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.970
 these things were in the back of my mind. Unfortunately, I tried to

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.790
 join in high school and my eyesight is really bad, so they had disqualified

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.600
 me from joining. So I spent two years outside of high school

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.410
 trying to you know make my way through community college, make my way

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.230
 through various odd jobs, and it just wasn't for me. So like the

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.040
 military was a good step to, I tried again and I was accepted. So that

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.850
 was really step to start me off on a good career.
