00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.430
The officers have a step system just like the enlisted sailors do. So

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.020
 for the officers you have O1 which is Ensign, you've probably heard

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.600
 those from the movies and things like that. For O2 that's Lieutenant

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.180
 JG, Lieutenant Junior Grade. For O3 there's a Lieutenant. O4 is Lieutenant

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.770
 Commander. O5 is Commander. O6 is a Captain and Captains are

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.350
 the ones, they're basically really really high in their officer community.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.930
 They're the people that command the ship, command the aircraft

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.520
 carrier, those are Captains. After that, then you have people who

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.100
 have been Captains for a long time and they're super senior people

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.680
 that you see on TV, those are the Admirals. So you have Rear Admiral

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.270
 Lower Half, Upper Half, Vice Admiral and Admiral. That's O7, O8, O9,

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.850
 and O10.
