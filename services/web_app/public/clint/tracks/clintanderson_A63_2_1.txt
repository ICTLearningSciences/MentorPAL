00:0:0.0 --> 00:0:4.33
- Right now, I am in the north-east of Japan. It's in

00:0:4.33 --> 00:0:8.67
-  the Tohoku region. You might remember that that's

00:0:8.67 --> 00:0:13.0
-  the place that the big earthquake of Japan happened

00:0:13.0 --> 00:0:17.33
-  in 2011. So, I'm in, kind of like the countryside

00:0:17.33 --> 00:0:21.67
-  of Japan and there are big buildings and skyscrapers

00:0:21.67 --> 00:0:26.0
-  but life is very quiet up in this part.
