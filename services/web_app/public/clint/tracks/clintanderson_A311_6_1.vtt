00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.050
For me I'm really excited to be in a technical field because I kind of

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:11.250
 see what's on the new horizon and I see things like you can chop off

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.450
 your finger and have a new, a new, finger be replaced with bioengineering

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.650
 or maybe a robotic one with prosthetic limbs personally I really

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.850
 like the fact that maybe five years ten years from now we'll all

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.050
 be in a virtual world we'll be able to put on some glasses or put

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.250
 on some contacts or whatever form it takes and be living in a new computerized

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.450
 world we'll be able to like make buildings and you know meet

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.650
 people all within, you know, from your seat at home all based on

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.850
 computer technology so I think it's really exciting.
