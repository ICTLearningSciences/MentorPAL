00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.420
I think I am at my proudest when I have some kind of difficult task, like

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.990
 some discrete math problem that, you know, I see that, you know,

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.560
 I can't do, you know, other people haven't, you know, done and all

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.140
 of a sudden, like, you just sit back, you know, you put your paper,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.710
 your pencils away and you think, "Alright, you know, like, they're not

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.280
 trying to attack you. What is it that I'm supposed to be doing?"

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.850
 and you think of a multi-level solution and you finally get the answer

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.420
 and you know, it's kind of like playing chess or something, you know,

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.990
 you get into this point where you can kind of see things, you know,

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.560
 like five six seven steps down the road and if you don't think

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.140
 of it that way, then you won't solve that problem. So, when I do think

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.710
 of it that way, you know, when I do solve those complex problems,

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.280
 that's when I'm my most proud, that means it's like, you know, a sign

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.850
 of my intelligence or something.
