00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.600
The things that I like to do most, well, right now that I'm in Japan,

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.350
 I love eating ramen, that's number one on my list. I love it. Ice cream

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.100
 is pretty good too. So, eating. Going to Yakitori, Yakiniku, these

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.850
 are, like, little barbecue places that, you know, you grow the food

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.600
 there. So, eating is pretty high on the list. Because in Japan, they

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.350
 don't have all of the things that I'm used to in America, then I

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.100
 kind of, just kind of hang out by myself, go to bars, obviously talking

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.850
 with friends and I play video games a lot while I'm here. So, that's,

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.600
 kind of like, the way that I pass my time. Back in the states,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.350
 I like to play basketball and I like to shoot archery, that's one

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.100
 of the things that I love to do and study, it's something that's I spend

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.850
 most my time with but actually enjoy. It's enjoyable because my

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.600
 major is making games. So, making games is something, it's, kind of,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.350
 fun. Yes, I'm studying, yes, it's my future career but I think I will

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.100
 be doing this even if I wasn't getting a degree or anything just

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.850
 because it's fun.
