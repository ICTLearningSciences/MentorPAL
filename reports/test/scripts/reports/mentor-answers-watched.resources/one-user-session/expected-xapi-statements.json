The most important thing that you can do in the military is follow directions, but not everybody does that, unfortunately, and your tasks as a supervisor is to confront these things and take care of them appropriately. So this is what I mean. Let's say that there is somebody on the ship, coming onto the ship any he's drunk and he's not supposed to be drunk. What do you do? So you could either grab him by the collar and take him to the local Master at Arms this person in trouble right, and that's the right thing to do. Another right thing to do would be to chastise him, to handle it in house to make sure that he doesn't do it again to kind of supervise and mentor him, if you think that he's that type of person so you don't have to necessarily ruin his career. So basically it's a morality question, the type of personality that you have and how willing to stick to the books you are to make sure that you do the right thing. When it comes to things that are going on in the plants, things that are going on in the engineering field there's no morality involved. If that thing is leaking you don't think hey you know like should I fix it or not, it's not that big. No if it's leaking, if X then Y. But when you're dealing with people, people with personalities, people with emotions, people with families, you have to really take all of that into consideration and to determine the wise thing to do, not necessarily the thing that's written in the book.",
