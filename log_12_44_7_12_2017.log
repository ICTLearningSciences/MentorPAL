"One of the fun stories that I have was when I was in Australia I started, I started to gamble. I never gambled before I wanted to see if I could take one thousand dollars and make ten thousand dollars. I said you know, I'm going to into this five star hotel you know, gambling on the bottom and I said I can stop. Ten thousand dollars that's enough for a car. I will come back and I won't gamble anymore I'll go out into the world. I had this trick that I could do for roulette which is like you take one dollar and if you lose it then you bet two dollars, if you lose it then you bet four dollars, if you lose then you bet eight dollars and eventually you're gonna win you know. Even if you lose lose lose lose lose lose lose lose lose, if you win on that tenth time as long as you keep doubling then you get all your money back and you know. So anyways I tried this trick. So we went to Australia and I was down in the bottom of the hotel and I was there for maybe seven hours six hours on my roulette wheel. So I started off with a hundred, I actually did Black Jack and I got into like two three hundred and I started roulette you know with my special trick and I got it up to two thousand dollars. So I'm like  ah I'm on my way you know it actually does work. So I went up to my room for that night, I was drinking champagne in the bathtub like watching TV you know and then I thought like wait a second I'm in Australia. Clint. Did you just spend your whole day in the gambling in a little you know off to the side hotel and gambling spot you know like like you can gamble in Las Vegas come on you know you should you should get out there and try to explore the country some. So the next day I go back down there and it's so funny there's this old lady who was there and she was there the night before, right. I went up to you know like take a nap and drink and I came back and she was still gambling right. So she was gambling on the hundred dollar chip tables and before I was doing like ten, ten dollar tables so I was like you know what? Here is my money let me go ahead and you know try to get this ten thousand dollars as fast as possible. So I go to right beside her, you know she is the only one at the table. Start betting hundred dollars, hundred dollars, hundred dollars. It's all gone. Whoop- bye two thousand dollars. I mean I left and I enjoyed Australia so. I like that story because it taught me to not be scared of losing money. Money didn't have that power over me that I did when I was, when I was a kid.",Have you been to Australia?
"Computer science is broken up into basically two different forms. The first one is computer science itself, which is everything that's associated with the laptop that's in front of you. That includes the theory that's behind it, the abstractions that are associated with thinking about the way that you know, computers should work. That involves the electronics that are behind it, you open up the computer and you can see the mother board, you can see the resistors, you can see the current that's traveling through it. So that's the hardware portion, that's the thing that's on the screen that deals with web design that deals with the way that the colors look, also graphics. That's how the light comes from the computer and hits your eyes. There's the user experience part which is when you have buttons all over the screen, and maybe this button shouldn't be like here, maybe people want it bigger or smaller, maybe they want it on the other side screen. Maybe they think that it's boring, but if you change it in a certain way so that it's more fun. So that's, all of that combined is computer science. But what most people think about when they think of computer science is actually the coding part. Coding is what happens when you have your laptop open, you open up a program and you start pushing buttons on your computer screen to write lines of code so that when you compile it, you press play, it does something for you. So for instance you can make a game, you compile the game and all of a sudden you can play the game. Or you can make, you can start coding and then when you press play, you have Microsoft Word based on the code that you wrote. So that's what most people think about when they think of computer science, they think of the program that's associated with it, but computer science is a very broad range.",Do you like being in computer science?
