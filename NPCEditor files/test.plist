<string>My name is EMC Clint Anderson. I have been in the Navy for about eight years, ever since 2000 for active duty and then eight more years as a reservist since 2008 until 2016. I went to college at the end of the tour that I did and the Navy gave me free benefits so I've been going to my bachelor's course at the University of California at Berkeley and then my master's course at the University of Southern California. I'm studying game development. I also work for the University of Southern California's Institute for Creative Technologies.</string>

<string>My name is EMC Clint Anderson, that's Electrician's Mate Clinton Anderson. I was born in Los Angeles, California. I was raised there most of my life and I graduated from high school there. A couple of years after graduating from high school, I joined the United States Navy. I was an Electrician's Mate for eight years. I served on an aircraft carrier. We went on many deployments. A deployment is when you go to war, you fight. We fought in the Iraq war. I went on three deployments and it was a really great time in my life. I had a lot of fun. At the end of the eight years, I decided that the Navy wasn't quite a career for me. So, I got out of the Navy. I started using the education benefits that we received and I started going to the University of California at Berkeley. I was majoring in computer science and afterwards, I started getting my master's degree from the University of Southern California. I also had a job at the Institute for Creative Technologies. It's been a lot of fun, this whole time. Thanks to the Navy.</string>

<string>So, I have a childhood that's pretty similar to many military people that I meet. When I was young, my parents divorced. My father, he was in the army. So I didn't see him that much. I lived with my mother for a long time. We moved from state to state. I lived in Washington for a while, I lived in Alabama for a while. Eventually, I moved back with my father instead of my mother, in California. So, I have actually seen a lot of America, thanks to their divorce. Eventually, I graduated from high school and after high school, me and my father we didn't really get along so I broke away from him and a couple of years afterwards I realized that I needed some kind of jobs help me with my finances, help me, you know find some kind of direction in life. So, that's when I joined the US Navy Reserve and the US Navy.</string>

<string>I had a great opportunity to know most of my family throughout my lifetime. My parents were divorced, so that means that I spent sometime with my mother's family, sometime with my father's family, sometime with my father's mother and sometimes with my mother's mother. So, I bounced around from household to household when I was a youth. I didn't really form any strong bonds with anyone but I did get an opportunity to see most of the world so I spent a couple years with my grandmother in Alabama. So, I got to shoot a few guns there and got to climb mountains and do all of that country stuff that, you know, a lot of people come into the Navy with. I just also lived in Michigan and it's kind of an impoverished area, if you have been watching movies and things, you probably know about this but it's developed my character in a lot of ways. Eventually, I finally moved to California and I have to say, out of all the places that I've been, which is all over America, California is the right place to be. It has a temperature that I want, the people and the diversity I want. So, maybe from now on I'll always stay in California.</string>

<string>In Michigan, it's the place that I stayed had a diverse amount of people but it was mostly crime ridden in some places. I've seen lots of things that you see on movies. For instance, drug use, some violence here and there. I've seen more graphic things like prostitution, homeless shelter and things like that. But those are things that I think maybe turned me into wanting to help my society a little bit more. Those are negative things. These are things that kind of pushed me to want to make the world a better place because I saw them. So, even though Michigan was, the part that I grew up in, Flint, isn't the, you know, ideal city, it is a good place to grow up and develop your character.</string>

<string>So, the type of student that I was in college, in high school and in elementary school, it varied. It was kind of like a sine wave. So, when I was in elementary school, I always took tests and they always said that I was like very very high achieving or something like that. I always scored really high on my IQs, so I got the impression that I was a really bright kid. In high school, it kind of dipped down. I was a little bit more independent. I stopped doing my homework. I stopped listening to teachers. I started hanging out with friends a lot more. So, my 4.0s and 3.8s started  going down to you know, very very low. That's one of the reason that I didn't go to college right away. I think many people in the nuclear field like I'm in had a very similar story. I'd say more than half the people had that story. They were bright as kids but they kind of somehow lost their way, ended up going to community college and then going to the military or some other situation. So, going through the military actually helped me out a lot because it taught me a lot of self discipline, a lot of reasons to get motivated to study a lot. So, after I finished my active duty Navy career, I went back to college and I was on par. I started doing well with the smarts that I was given.</string>

<string>Besides Los Angeles, I've lived all up and down the coast of California. So, I grew up in Los Angeles that's where I graduated from high school at and then after I did my 8 year tour in the Navy, I went to college in the San Francisco area. My college was Berkeley which is right across the bay. During my Navy stint, they sent me to San Diego. So I've had maybe two or three years in all of those cities. Those are the major cities of California.</string>

<string>During wartime, the tempo is a lot higher than it normally is. So, I fought in the Iraq war and then in the Afghanistan war and during those times we were in the middle of the ocean and days were pretty long from 6 AM to sometimes midnight very very often. We did so much training. It was a very trying time but is also rewarding because your patience is tested, your drive and your motivation is tested and eventually you fight the war and you do a lot of good things. So, it actually works out.</string>

<string>So, joining the military is a dangerous career. If you want to join the Navy but you're scared of going into battle, then there are obviously jobs for you but you have to inherently realize that being in the military is by definition a dangerous career. So, I was on a ship for the most of the time but they could have sent me anywhere. So, you have to be willing to accept that fact. However, even on the ship, there are dangers. For instance, you could be telling the ships where to go but they say that the top of the aircraft carrier is one of the most dangerous places that you can be, it's one of the most dangerous jobs. Additionally, once you're back home, you're with your family, you have a normal job but they could say, "Hey, you know what? We need more people out there in the field." So, they could just call you and you could be with the army people, with the marines people, fighting wars. But for the most part, the air force and the navy, they tend to have supporting roles to the army and the marines.</string>

<string>So, my job as an EMC, Electrician's Mate is to fix pumps, to do preventive maintenance, to work on voltage regulators, to have lots of training as well. But the Navy also provides you with releases from your job. If you do the same job the whole entire time, you might get kind of frustrated, so I actually worked in the supply department which is where, for instance, there is the veins in the ship and there's like painting that needs to be done, there's lots of cleaning that has to be done. Some people work in the tech pubs library, which means that there's books for everybody on the ship that has to do their job. So you can work there for a while. So, basically for about six months to a year, you work in your main job and then they kind of give you a break even though you're on the same ship and then you have that cycle. So, you're always doing something different.</string>

<string>So, with the Navy, they always give you training. That's something that's going to be ingrained in your heart by the end of your Navy tour. So, the ways that they train you is that they have one of the people in your unit go up and provide something from a book that you probably learn in A school, that you probably learn on the job. So, for instance, the diagram of the reactor and we're supposed to know, for instance, all the valves that are there, we're supposed to know what to do in case of a casualty. For instance, if there's a fire in one of the pumps, we have to say, "Well, you're supposed to turn off valve A, B and C", and then call it in and then we'll tell the watch officer and then ask somebody to help and then go back and fight the fire. What happens if there is like, a radiation spill? Are you supposed to, you know, do these things? So, for instance, every time that you have a casualty, which means that there is a problem in the ship, be it a fire, a flood, scram of the reactor, which means it breaks down, then you have to know what each of those steps are. And after being in the Navy for what, a year let's say, if you don't train about it, then you're going to forget it. So, they allow a little bit of forget and then they train on it so you remember it. Then, you have that cycle of training over and over and over.</string>

<string>I'm not an Officer. I'm a Chief, which is an E7 for the pay grade. The military is broken up into two portions, enlisted people who actually do the work and officers who basically manage. Now, the enlisted people, after a certain pay grade, E6 or E7, you start to supervise those enlisted people. Officers, from day one, they're automatically in charge of the whole unit.</string>

<string>I have a college degree and that allows me to apply to be an officer but not everybody who has that degree wants to go that route. So, to be an officer, you have to want to manage people, do lots of paperwork sometimes, to be in charge of the success or the failure of an entire unit and that carries a lot of responsibility. I'm an enlisted person and I do supervise the people that are underneath me. However, an officer's main goal is to become more and more important down the line. So, for instance, if you're a captain or even a commander, you could have 300-400 people underneath you and that's the main goal of most officers. For an enlisted person, you're more technically based. So, even though you have a small unit, that drive to want to lead people is slightly different.</string>

<string>So, the difference between an officer and enlisted member, they kind of meld together once you get higher in superiority but the real difference is when you start. An E1 or an E2 seaman or airman, basically their only goal, their only in purpose in life is to do a technical job whereas an officer an insign (insignia), his day one is actually managing a group of people. Obviously, they're both training but the goal of what they're supposed to do is slightly different. As you get higher, as you get to become E5, 6 or 7 for enlisted or you become a lieutenant, that's an O3 for an officer, then you start going into management and supervising people. So, at least on the ship, you would see that the E7s, the Chiefs and O3s, the lieutenants are working side by side, pretty much doing the same thing but in the lower ranks, then enlisted is technical, officers are management.</string>

<string>So, deployment life can be pretty hard sometimes. Most of the time you're working. I'd say about 75% of most days you're either going to work or coming from work or you know, sitting down preparing to go for work in a few hours. But, there is time to relax. So, many people, they join bands, they watch DVDs from the recreation center that we have there, they sit around and play cards, they kind of just sit and if it's later on at night, then you sleep, although like during the work day, you're not supposed to sleep at all. So, I remember my days would be, I would wake up at about 6:50, I would be in group, in formation at 7. It's only ten minutes I know, but you learn to be very very quick and then you're working until four o'clock. And from that point on, you could stand watch which would be another six hours after that, at least for me. Some people don't stand watch, some people do, its about half-half. Or you could be doing these trainings that come later on that night, they're called General Quarters. We were fighting a war, so they pretend like a bomb hit us or there's some kind of chemical spill or things that make you, that keep you on your feet to make sure that you have all the skills that you need to fight the casualty. So, short answer, you're working pretty much all day.</string>

<string>During your off time, while you're deployed, you have a couple things that you can do. So, I remember, personally I would always go play poker and steal people's money even though you're not supposed to but we'd find some ways to, you know, have fun with each other. We would trade, like coke bottles or trade cigarettes. Some people smoked, I didn't, but I'd still, you know, like be in the middle of trading things for cards. I also watched a lot of DVDs. So, we had an MWR, a morale recreation and welfare program where you have a choice of maybe 200 or 300 DVDs. You just tell them that's the one that you want and then you can watch it on, if you have your own personal DVD player or a laptop. I'd also just go out there on the fantail and just watch the ships go by, you know, ships go by and jets go by and maybe for going along the coast, just look at the beautiful country that we're going beside.</string>

<string>So, when you're not deployed, life is actually pretty good. So, the military comes in waves. Our hard time is when we go on deployment. That's when you give it your all, that's when you're working the hardest but when you come back then they kind of go easy on you. So, well actually, I was living in San Diego. This is an example from when I was down there and our days were pretty early so that we fight the rush hour traffic. I think they began at six and then noon, that's when we normally have our lunch but they just send us home. So, days are cut short at six hours and so you just like, actually it's five hours because the traffic is the thing that cuts most of the morning. So, days are from seven to noon and then you split and go home and go see your family. So, you have a lot more time sometimes when you get off deployment.</string>

<string>The work that I tend to do on a typical day actually depends on whether I'm deployed or not deployed. So, on deployment, then you pretty much are working the whole day and it's broken up into chunks. The first part of the day is just getting together, talking about how the rest of the day is going to be, do work orders. We write about the things that we should be doing for, maybe the next week or the next couple of hours or something like that. So the next chunk is we actually go and perform the work. So that's about another three or four hours. The next chunk is we get back and we start doing training, so we make sure that we're ready for casualties that happen, if there's a fire, if there's a flood. Then that's about the time that you get off work and you have a couple of hours just to kind of relax and hang out but later on at night, then you do this thing called General Quarters which means that you come back and the whole ship pretends like there is a big casualty happened to the entire ship. So your days can go into the night. When you are not deployed and you're stationed, you know, stateside, then your days are a lot easier. You have one part of, you know, training what we want to do later on. You have another part of training where you just open up a book and review some electronics or nuclear power things and then you have a small part where you are just doing preventive maintenance, which means that you're working on a pump, make sure that's fine, opening up regulators, making sure you know, nothing's inside and putting new equipment on the ship.</string>

<string>Now that I'm not in the active duty Navy, I joined the US Navy Reserves and I've been there for about the last eight years. So, that job isn't extremely difficult. They say that it's two days per month, two weeks per year and I've actually worked a lot more than that but it's a minimal time in the military. So, I've had a lot of time to do whatever I wanted to. I've split it between working at jobs. For instance, my job is, I'm a Japanese teacher in Japan but also work for the University of Southern California Institute for Creative Technologies and I find little pieces of jobs here and there. So, I'm a part of a start-up. A computer science start-up working with virtual reality. I also go to school. So, I'm a full-time master's student when I'm back in America and I am studying game development.</string>

<string>So, your paycheck is one of the biggest things that people really love about working for the military. Right now, I'm a Chief, so I make about $4500 per month. Well, I don't make it, I am in the US Navy Reserve but usually on active duty, Chiefs make $4500 per month and they also have this thing called BAH, Basic Allowance for Housing which almost doubles your paycheck. So, you get about like $2500 per month and if you add that up it's about $75000 per year.</string>

<string>The amount of hours that you work in a typical day actually depend on whether you're deployed or not. So, if you're deployed fighting the war, then I'd say 12 hours would probably be the average. On some days you get away with working only eight, that's including Saturdays. Many days, in fact every four days, you're working for a day and a half. So, you stand your eight hours of normal work and then you have your General Quarters, which is actually training at night time for two or three or four hours and then you could have another watch from midnight until six the next day and you could possibly have your normal work day tacked on the end of that. So, you know, some days, if you're really in it, you're working, you know, a day and a half to two. Sundays were my easiest days where I'd only work for six hours and that's like a great day for me. When you are not deployed, then days are a lot easier. You probably get to work around seven and then you leave around noon so that means your days are only five hours or six hours.</string>

<string>Problems show up every now and then. When you're on active duty, so it kind of depends on whether you're deployed or not. If you're deployed, that means things happen, you know, with any mechanical equipment. So, pumps could break in the middle of the night and then you get waken up and, you know, you have to go fix it. Sometimes you have people that come in drunk, on the weekends and when we were in port, so you'd have to make sure that, like, to get to their bed safely and that they get disciplined later on. Things like that happen on deployment.  When you are not deployed, then you still hear the drunk people coming in, you know, but because you're not, the ship isn't being used over and over and over every single day in and out, problems with the equipment doesn't happen as much. So, you just do preventive maintenance, which means that even though this pump looks fine, you're just going to open it up and check to make sure that the oil is there, and you know, that is at the right temperature and shut it. So, a lot easier time.</string>

<string>So, you probably heard of the term 'drunken sailors' and that's for a good reason. Once you are deployed and you pull into a port, which is like a little city of a new country, then the people are very very angsty and they want to get out and, you know, party a little bit. So, you probably been on the ship, in the middle of the ocean, you haven't seen another, you know, non-military soul for about a month. So, they really want to go out there and, you know, like, you know, do the opposite of what they were doing which is being disciplined. Now, they want to, you know, go be young kids. The military's basically eighteen to twenty four year olds. So, kind of like the college life. So, they go out there and do college level things. They find the first bar, they sit with each other and just, you know, find, you know, the cheapest alcohol and you could find them there the whole entire day and then they come back to the ship. The military knows this, so they have people walking around, checking into the bars, making sure they aren't caught causing fights, which they are, make sure that people aren't, you know, drinking too much which they are, make sure that people can make it home safely, you know, which means that they come back by taxi, which means that they come in handcuffs sometimes but it's all in good fun. By the time we leave, out of five thousand people or sometimes eight thousand people that are there, you only have maybe one or two that actually get into real big trouble. I personally didn't, I personally wasn't involved in that drunk culture so much. I actually liked to go out to the town and explore, you know, the museums and the scenery and things like that but I had a few drinks myself too.</string>

<string>As soon as you join the military, probably your very first week, even though you're at bootcamp, so you have no access to alcohol but from that time,you know, all the way up until you end your career, you're going to be hearing about alcohol, alcohol responsibility, the fact that you can't drink too much, the fact that, you know, alcohol ruins people's lives and it's a very big thing for our culture. So, the Navy takes some strides to kind of change this. We get lots of training. We get, for instance, when we go to ports, when we're on deployment, we have this thing called the 'buddy system', which means that you're not allowed to go out yourself. You actually have to tap one of your friends and the both of you go out to explore this new city. They want to make sure that you don't go out there and get yourself into trouble by drinking too much alcohol and then having a stranger, you know, guide you back to the ship. There are people who would rob you, there are people who will, you know, do harm to you. So, the 'buddy system' is probably the Navy's biggest way to combat alcohol misuse.</string>

<string>So, from the day that you join the Navy, you're going to find that you have similar past to people that are in your same field. So, you know, there are people who are very motivated and want to become the Master Chief of the Navy. You have some people who, maybe were criminals before and joined the military to prevent going to jail, to be given a shot for normal life before they winded up in a bad place. So, you have the whole gamut of people and different career paths, different intelligence, different motivations for being in the military. So, in general, people of a similar quality tend to hang out with the same people. So, people who like to drink all the time, you'll find that they're, you know, have this one house that they always go to, over and over. People that are very very motivated study all the time. You'll find that they probably share a house with people who want to become an officer. So, you also find that that's very apparent in the ports that you go to. So, for me, I didn't want to. I wasn't a drinker at that time. Not, not very much. So I'd go into port and I try to tap people like, "Hey, do you want to go see some place fun?", "Do you want to go climb a mountain or visit a castle? So, once we do that, then there's very limited chance of, that we'd find problems. Some of the people who, like, are really, you know, really eager to have fun, the very first place that they go to is the bar and people similar to them are there and you can get lots of people like that, then probably, you can find yourself into trouble. So, as long as you're aware of that, as long as you're not somebody that drinks all the time and you know, wants to get me in trouble who's just trying to, like, visit ports and one time, even though I don't want to drink all the time, I have to realize that if I visit people that are drinking all the time, then I might get in trouble as well. Like, as long as you can kind of, you're aware of your specific sphere, then you'll have a much better time in the military.</string>

<string>So, when you do this type of work, you get a lot of benefits. When I joined, I think I was working at McDonald's and the swap meet. Maybe the movie theater too, I think I was working two or three jobs at, you know, all around the year and I didn't have any type of direction. I knew I was smart but I just didn't have enough time to, you know, pay my bills at the time. So, I joined the military and one of their promises, they said that you could have a really high paying job at the end of your career. You know, it's a six year contract. So, I said, "Okay, well I have these skills". They taught me math, they taught me physics, thermodynamics, chemistry and by the end of my six year tour, I had enough knowledge to basically become Homer Simpson. I could go out there and work at a nuclear power plant, full of confidence. So, they give you the skills that you need to get a really high paying job or a different job. You know, depends on what you want to do.</string>

<string>So, at the end of their active duty tour, you have a lot of options in front of you. Number one, you can try to go back into the military if you like the career. If you wanted to stay in the same field, then you could. So, for instance, the aircraft mechanics. Yes, they were fixing jets and they were working on jets. So, there aren't that many jets that they could work on outside but Boeing is eager to hire those people. You can see how jets and 747s kind of, are the same thing. So, you can find something in your field. For me, personally I didn't actually like my field completely, enough to make a full career out of it. So, I changed. Instead of Electrician's Mate, I became a computer scientist which is something completely different but, all of the basic skills that I received, the math, the physics, the thinking logically about things, they still apply to my computer science.</string>

<string>So, for all the benefits that the military job provides you, you can also have a lot of frustration with the job. For most people, I think this might be the hardest that you'll ever work in your life. That's how come the military has young people do it and then, once they leave, they go on to productive careers but they'll always say, "You know what, I can do anything because I worked so hard for the military." Along with those long working hours, you're away from your family. That's a part of, having those long working hours. So, for instance, deployment is probably everyone's major reason for getting out. They want to see their kid grow up, they want to spend more time with their wife, they want to actually date and have a social life. So these are things that you have to give up by joining the military.</string>

<string>For me, personally, joining the military was one of the best things that I could've done. You will work really hard and once you get out and you become a civilian, you realize that what you did was protect the nation. You protected the people around you, the civilians and you can kind of see, even the job that you'll start to have and the jobs that they've always had, you had a large part in making that possible. So, I think it was worth it for the pride that you get for serving your country and the skills that you obtain because I didn't have any of those skills before but from that point on, I had my education paid for and I had a valuable job that, if I ever wanted to, I could flip a coin and then have a really high paying job. So, it was definitely worth it.</string>

<string>The main thing that a new Navy person has to learn is that you have to be able to follow directions. If you can do that, then you'll be fine. If you've ever seen the movie Forrest Gump, this is a person who had an incredible military career and the only thing that he did was just follow the directions that people give him and that's basically the truth. You won't get in trouble if you follow the directions that people give you. You'll do your job well just by following the procedures that are in front of you and in fact, the main reason that people get in trouble is because they deviate from that. The Chief tells him, "Hey, go on to the billet and scrub it out" and then he doesn't feel like it. So, he gets in trouble. The Chief tells him, "Hey, you know what? Read this procedure A, B, C and D. Don't deviate" and he thinks that he wants to do it really faster or really quicker or you know and so, it never works out. So as long as you follow directions, you'll be fine.</string>

<string>When I was on active duty, we get one month per year. So, that's a lot of travel that I'm allowed to do but I didn't do too much of it. Kind of just stayed at home. There's this thing called the 'military bubble' where you kind of just hang out with the people in your same unit and don't really get out that much. And it's fun for a while. You have a lot of money so you can do lots of things, you can take these things called MAC flights where you can, if you're on leave, you can travel across the country for basically free but I think I was just waiting to become a civilian to actually really enjoy myself.

<string>Since I became a civilian, I think I travel a lot more than I did in the Navy. With the Navy, you actually get stationed all over the country. Now that I'm civilian, I pretty much stay in California, that's my hometown but I have the opportunity to travel a lot more. So, I take flights to New York, just, if I feel like it. I take drives to Las Vegas, because it's kind of close to Los Angeles and I also still get to travel a lot because of the US Navy Reserve. So, in the US Navy Reserve, they send you to the four corners of America. We go to New Hampshire, to  Virginia, also to Washington and San Diego. So, pretty much every year, they actually send me there. They give you a free car and a free hotel, so it's kind of like, a little mini travel. Work isn't that difficult, so I use that as a way to get out. I was also stationed in Hawaii last year and that was really fun.</string>

<string>So, some of the lifestyle changes that you can expect: number one, get used to wearing uniform. You're going to be putting this thing on every single day. We have a couple of different styles to choose from. We can put on coveralls if we're on the ship. These are the cammies that we wear when you're walking around a normal city but we also have like, a dress whites and dress blues. They look really nice. Another lifestyle change you can expect is to be following orders. So, if you're working at McDonald's and you have a boss telling you, you know, "Go to drive thru", "Go to make some breakfast in the morning", so same thing, that's not going to change just because you're the military. In fact, it's going to get a little bit more intense you could say. So, you're going to have, you know, five or six bosses. They have a hierarchy and you're going to hear from one less than the other but you're going to be hearing, you know, what to do every single day.</string>

<string>So, this uniform that we have is, first of all, I like the colors. Makes you look really really military, if you can say that. There's this person, Steve Jobs. He used to wear the same exact thing every single day and he was very successful as a computer manager and he said that he wore the same exact thing because he didn't have to think about what to wear every single day. So, you get into that impression here, you know, like you know what you're going to wear so there's like very very little thought process of what it's going to be. Is it going to be the same thing I wore yesterday or is it going to be this new fresh one but it's going to be cammies today, so.</string>

<string>There's the Master Chief of the Navy, there's the Secretary of Defense, obviously the President and Vice-President, that's the hierarchy. Obviously if you're in active duty, then you have your Commanding Officer, you have your XO and those are, that's the President and Vice-President of your little command. But specifically, within your work center, the Chief is the guy. Chief, Senior Chief, Master Chief, those are the people that are in charge of all the enlisted people and they're your whole world. That's your mom and your dad.</string>

<string>So, I have to admit, many people who are actively working for the Navy don't really know how they fit into the big picture and that's by design. It's very specialized. So, for instance, as an E1, E2, E3, your whole entire world is to do this technical job, to fix a pump, to paint this wall and you might not see it but making sure that pump is fixed or making sure that wall is painted, makes sure that the ship can run. Making sure that the ship can run, make sure that the officer can fly a jet, making sure that that jet is fixed and that pilot knows his information, make sure that he can drop this bomb, making sure that bomb drops, make sure that the battle is won, making sure that the battle is won, make sure the war is won. So, when you are painting that wall, you don't really see how that is actually helping you win the war in Afghanistan but it does. So, the higher you get in your enlisted pay grade, the more you see that big picture. I'm an E7, so my responsibility is to know how this unit can help the civilians, make sure that this aircraft carrier runs fine and I think as officers, the higher you get, if you're a captain, you make sure that this aircraft carrier fits in this realm of the region so that, like we have power over there, we can dominate our foes. So, it depends on your pay grade.</string>

<string>So, with the military, your job is your life. You're in the military for twenty four hours. even on your weekends. So, as long as you, you know, encompass this fact, you know, make that a part of your being, then you understand why it is that at night time, you might still be working on some kind of project. So, for instance, if you're, maybe E1 through E6, you have your normal work day and then you might be called back in sometimes to make sure that a night event can go on as required and nobody ever has a problem with that but usually, for E1 through E6, they have a full-time job. When we're on deployment, which means that we're out there fighting the war, then they're called all the time. When you're back home and you have your family life, you're expected to go home every single night, then it's, it can be a little bit tricky, trying to balance both of them. Your civilian life is, it can be really tough.</string>

<string>Now that I'm not in active duty, I find that I'm still working pretty often, even though I'm not on the clock per se, I still have to bring my work home with me sometimes. So, for instance, in the US Navy Reserve, you're supposed to work two days per month, I'm sorry, two days per month and two weeks per year but I find that I'm working, sometimes Mondays, sometimes Wednesdays, sometimes Monday Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday, doing evaluations, making sure that we have some kind of lunch that we're supposed to go to, making sure that people have their correct physical training. So, it's not a nine to five job normally. When I was active duty and I wasn't on deployment and I was just stationed at my command, you still work many many cases during night time. So, as long as you just make sure that, you understand that that could happen, that your wife or your husband understands that situation, then, you realize that work is work and is what you have to do.</string>

<string>After you do your activity tour, then it really depends on what type of job you have, to dictate what you want to do afterwards. So, if you really love your job, then you'll probably make it a thirty year career if that's possible. I know a lot of people who were like spies, you know, the crypto techs, the people in human relations, the public relations officers, they absolutely love their job and they couldn't think of doing anything else. Some of the people with harder jobs, for instance, the nuclear field, maybe some of the advanced jobs like the E. T.'s or the fire control men, they might be expected to do a little bit more work and they can be a little bit more demanding, sometimes a little bit more frustrating. They have to do more sea tours, so you get to a point where you want to actually live the civilian life that you see many other people are experiencing. So, by the time your six years is up or four years, in some cases, is up, that's a pretty big milestone for you to make for your career and the turnover can be pretty sharp. My guess is that 20% of people actually stay in, while the other 80%, they actually go out and use their education benefits and live higher paying jobs, doing something that's a lot easier work.</string>

<string>So, job security is one of the military's major major positives. You're not going to get fired unless you really do something bad and even if you do something bad, as long as it's not, you know, like, short of murder, then you're still going to be there, you're still going to, you might be reduced a rank or two, sometimes I've even seen three, but they will keep you and as long as you have the motivation to get yourself back, then you will always have a job.</string>

<string>So, it depends on what your rank is but the people that are above you, they're the ones who kind of tell you what it is you're supposed to be doing. So, if you're one of the lower pay grades, then, in the morning, you kind of just sit around and you wait for them to pass out the work to everyone. A Chief will come in and say, "Okay you're on pumps today, you're on valves today, you're fixing the drains today, you're in the bilge today." Chiefs are the ones who actually tell people what to do. So, they don't need to be told what it is they're supposed to be doing because they only have one job, which is to hand out the work. On the other hand, Officers, has basically the same pay grade, the same direction of flow. So, for instance, an O1, O2, O3, they're told by the higher level people who they're supposed to be managing, "You're supposed to be tagging along with these people", or I think for Officers, their main goal is just to be, to train themselves. So, they hang out in their room or they hang out down in the plants, just studying. So, Officers have a lot more opportunity to self-study. Enlisted people, they will know exactly what they're doing for the first two or three years of their career.</string>

<string>So, for the eight years that I've been in the US Navy active duty service, I've seen everyone have high stress symptoms, I myself am in included that several times. So, these working hours can be really long and there have been many times when I just wanted to say, "Hey, you know, I just want to go to my bed and relax and sleep and not have anyone tell me what to do" but the difference between a military person and a civilian is that it's ingrained in us to take orders. So, regardless of how I feel, at the end of the day, I'm going to do my work. Maybe a civilian person would quit their job, maybe a civilian person would yell at their boss but military people, they don't do that. That's our culture. So, you live with it. You live with the stress that comes with the job.</string>

<string>So, if you're in the Navy and you find out that you don't like the job that you're doing, the best thing I can say is, at least for a short amount of time, you have to suck it up. I know some people who didn't want to be Machinist's Mates but they were given an option of like three or four jobs, they chose something else and then they were given that Machinist's Mate job anyways. So, at the end of four years, and you have to do your four years, they lived that life, they learned those things, they did that training, they did that job and at the end, then they left and did something else for the civilians. You can't really change your job after you have decided to do it. So, me, I've been an Electrician's Mate this whole entire time and there are very very few opportunities that I could actually change. I could've been an officer and then my lifestyle would have changed or I could have chosen my command later on in my career. That would have changed my lifestyle but it wouldn't have actually changed my job itself. So, I guess one big suggestion is make sure that the job that you're getting yourself involved in, is something that you think you could really do and have fun with.</string>

<string>You can change career fields after a while, either in the military because you've been doing your job for a while and you can choose your next command that you go to or you can try to do a job that just requires your pay grade but doesn't require a specific job. Like, for instance, Electrician's Mate, I am an E7, so I can do an E7 job, a Chief job that doesn't require Electrician's Mate itself but those are few and far in between. So, once you get out of the military, if that's the choice that you choose to make, then I think that the skills that they provide you, for instance, math and science and taking orders, those can be applied anywhere. So, as long as I'm in a technical field, I think as an Electrician's Mate, I can do anything from working on aircraft carriers to working in the academic field. Right now, I'm a computer science major and I'm still using some of the Electrician's Mate things that I learned. So, your opportunities to expand your career greatly widen after you get out of military.</string>

<string>When I joined, I had a couple of opportunities in front of me. I think I originally wanted to be a crypto tech but the nuclear field was very very exciting. They said that I had a good opportunity to go to the Naval Academy, they said that I'd learn physics and chemistry and thermodynamics and nuclear power, you know, very very well, they said that it's an advanced field and people out there in the civilian world know it. So, they gave all of these positives to join the nuclear field and I got to admit, that actually overshadowed any other job that I wanted to pursue. In A school, you learn, basically graduate level nuclear work, nuclear studies. So, I'd been in college and I went to master's courses and I got to admit, the military is actually more intense than college, than any college that I'd been to. They work you for eight hours per day, they give you lots of tests and it's simple, they always say that nuclear field is as hard as a pre-calc or I'm sorry, a pre-algebra class and that's actually true. Everything is written down for you in easy to read explanations and so if you could read normally as a high school student, for instance, if you got As and Bs and maybe even Cs in high school, then this learning is no problem for you. The difference is, you have to be willing to do it for a long time and if you start lacking, then you need to start doing all the homework that they tell you to do. They're not going to let you fail. The difference is, everybody that goes through this training, by the end, for the nuclear field at least, they know exactly what you're going to do, how to do the nuclear training that they've been shown and if you can't, then you have to do something else. So, there is no opportunity for failure.</string>

<string>When I joined and they told me I was going to be in the nuclear field, I have to admit, until I started going to the school itself, I did not know what a nuke was. So, did I work with nukes? The answer is no. 'Nukes' mean nuclear weapons and if you work for a submarine, for a ballistic submarine, then you do see the nukes but you're not the one who is working on them. What the nuclear field means, is that we work for the engineering portion of the nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. So, we're the engine of the ship. If you think of a car as the aircraft carrier, then we're the things that make it, you know, go 'Boom!'. We're the thing that makes it go forth through the road I guess and we're the people that make electricity happen for the entire ship, we're the people that make the CD player run, basically we're the life blood of the aircraft carrier.</string>

<string>I had a good opportunity to meet a really smart Chinese person when I was working as a, when I was education abroad here in Japan. So, I finished and I went to USC to start my master's and he finished and he went back to China to start his start-up. I had to ask him a few questions for the games I was making at USC and he was asking how to design a virtual reality program that he was making for me and we found out that we work pretty well together, you know, we both thought we were pretty smart, we both thought like, we work well together, we made each other laugh, so he said, "Hey, why don't you join my start-up?" So, I was there as a founding member and the games that we're making, we've made many in fact. One is that we used a Kinect to be combined with a Leap Motion controller and you can move around the play area in this kind of like virtual reality world, fighting dragons. Another game that I made was made with the VIVE controller and where you shoot zombies. The current game that we're making is supposed to be really really popular. It's basically a cross between Super Mario and Legend of Zelda, where you just walk in this world going up and up, trying to fight this monster at the top. It's really cool and it's a, people say it's a lot of fun.</string>

<string>When I started to go to school, I wanted to be able to speak five languages by the time I was 27. I was 21 at that time. So, that's why I wanted to join the military, to go to their world famous language schools and learn to speak French, which I knew a little bit of, German, which I knew a little bit of, Spanish which I knew a little bit of and my English. Since then, I've also learned Japanese. So, the reason that I'm in Japan right now, is so that I can actually learn the language fully, because I didn't know that many languages up until now. So, I decided, "Hey, come here, live for a long time and learn it, you know, intensively for a year."</string>

<string>When you're in the military, you're given a lot of technical training but we're fortunate that we don't really have to apply that technical training. When you're working, you have this list of things that you're supposed to do and you do it, you have this list of procedures that you're supposed to follow and you follow them and when you don't know something, that's wrong with something that you're working on, like a pump or a valve or a voltage regulator, there's already a list, a well-guided list of the procedures that you're supposed to follow. So, I didn't deal with technical problems so much in that regard, however that doesn't mean that we don't figure out technical things all the time. So, especially during your A school and your power school, you're presented with, you know, college level problems all the time. So, for instance, here is an electrical schemata and you're not getting voltage at this, at this point. So, how is that possible? Or, this is a picture of a pump and for some reason, there's water coming from this part. Please troubleshoot how you would figure out where this water is faulting at. So, after A school, you're presented with those types of problems pretty often throughout the time that you're in the Navy. You don't see them so often. When you do see it, it's a really big problem because, like, we do so much preventive maintenance and we do so much work that you're definitely not supposed to see them. But when you do have that problem, it's a big group effort and it's really hard to like, say that one person actually figured it out but you're presented with those small theoretical problems all the time.</string>

<string>Most of my time is spent with people, regardless of where you go. There's very few times that you're going to find yourself just being alone, just like I'm in port, they always have a buddy along to make sure that you don't get in trouble. When you're working, they actually have a buddy that goes with you to make sure that you follow the procedures the right way. So, you're always working with between two and five people for normal preventive maintenance that you do, and for each of those things, the only thing that we do is we work with machines.

Most Chiefs become Chiefs after about twelve years or maybe fourteen years. Some of the hot runners can become Chiefs after eight years but basically, no matter what, number one, they're really good at their job, number two, they have the support of the officers to make sure that they can take care of the plants themselves and number three, they have really good expertise and years in doing what they've been doing. So, they can be trusted to actually tell you what to do because they've done it so many times themselves.</string>

<string>So, we have this term, it's 'in port'. 'In port' means that you're stationed, you're not stationed you're actually at another country's, kind of, naval base. It might not actually be a naval base. It's a place that can hold ships. So, when you're on deployment, let's say, you're in the middle of the ocean, you're there for a month or two months. Then you finally want to, you know, put your feet on land, so you could probably stop in Hong Kong or Singapore, wherever they can hold a ship that's safe for a United States naval vessel. You can pull in and then, that's a new country for you. That's 'in port'.</string>

<string>I was fortunate enough to be in port in many countries. I got to go to Hong Kong, Singapore. I went to Australia. Three different places, Hong Kong and Tasmania. I also went to Dubai and Bahrain and Kuwait. I got to go to the Malaysia, the Golden Triangle which was really cool. My favorite place was Sasebo, Japan, which is where I am now and a couple of other places. It's really been a fun journey.</string>

<string>A school is the initial training that joining members of the enlisted branch go to. So, my A school was Electrician's Mate A school. Whatever your rate is, then you have an A school and, for initial people, C school for more advanced people. So, A schools can range from, maybe a couple of weeks to maybe, several years. Mine was six months, in fact.</string>

<string>So, the nuclear question. What experience do I have with nuclear bombs? I don't have any idea what they are. I know kind of, what goes inside them because my job particularly deals with nuclear things but the nuclear technology that's used to power an aircraft to go through the water is very different from the nuclear reaction that goes on inside a nuclear bomb. Now that's not to say that some people don't. I was on an aircraft carrier, which means that there are no nukes on an aircraft carrier. However, other nuclear technicians, they go on submarines. Now, we have ballistic submarines, so they're walking right beside those nuclear bombs. We call them tridents or yeah yeah, I don't know anything about the submarine force, you have to ask them.</string>

<string>I've been deployed three times. I joined the Navy when I was 21 years old, in 2000 and then I stayed there for eight years. So, the first two years were for school and then the last six years, that's the time I was on the aircraft carrier and during that time, I went out to the sea, deployment, for six months each, well, six months then seven months then eight months within two year sprints. So, in two years, you're supposed to go on one deployment, six months time. Then, you're supposed to come back for a year, I'm sorry, you're supposed to come back for a year and a half. So, six months deployment, one and a half years, you know, stationed at home, six months deployment, one and a half years stationed at home. So, because, I was in for six years, I did three deployments.</string>

<string>9/11 has a special place in my heart because I had just joined the Navy, well I was in school when it happened. That was, maybe the first year that I was in, I hadn't seen a ship yet. I didn't know what the military life outside of school was like but I remember walking down my steps to my roommate, when he saw, when we both saw together, the first, actually I saw the second plane hit, the first one had already been hit and my roommate called and he was like, "Hey, look at this!", so. After it got started, I remember that there was a little bit of fear that I had, you know, I didn't know how big this thing was going to be. I definitely didn't know that there was a war that was about to be started but I did realize that, that's when it finally hit me. Before, I thought, the military is a place that you go, you learn some kind of job, you have a nine to five job and you probably clean some things, you work out a little bit but after 9/11 happened, then I realized, "You know what?", there's a job that needs to be done and I'm probably going to be the one that's going to need to do this.  So, I went into protection mode at that time. That's what it meant to me, 9/11.</string>

<string>So, I'm particularly fond of the military. I joined when I was 21 and I didn't really have that many skills available to me. I graduated high school and I wasn't the best high school grad, you know, many people in the military aren't and I tried college for a while and I was very, on and off again student. I got a few Fs when I was there and because I was working two jobs at the time and you know, my days were pretty full. So, the military actually allowed me to have a semi-regular life, you know, like &lt;not clear&gt;. Because I was taking care myself, because I didn't have the support of my family, the military welcomed me with a job, a place to stay, some cash in my pocket, a skill set and that pretty much, once I got that grounding, then I was able to be very independent, very self sustaining for a long time. So, it's kind of, it took care of me in that way. So, do I love the military? You could say that I do. You know, it's the thing that allowed me to have a college education later on, it's the thing that allowed me to save up so much money and I think I'm doing pretty well for someone my age, so. As far as my job, my job as an Electrician's Mate, I didn't, it's not the job that I really wanted to do at the beginning. I wanted to learn languages and you know, travel the world a lot and I'm a nuclear technician. We weren't really allowed to do that because you're a nuke, you have to stay on the continental United States, So, I couldn't visit, I couldn't be stationed in Germany, I couldn't be stationed in France, which, you know, really, was irritating for me. And, I wasn't a very good engineer. I didn't have the engineering mindset when I joined the military at first. However, I grew to love my job because the training that they give you, they make you a real expert at it. So, once you find a job that you can do, you start doing well and then you start getting awards, you start learning more things on your own and eventually I said, "You know what? Electrician's Mate is really cool. It's one of the best jobs that you can have in the military. So, I think it's, my love for the Navy comes from all of that combined.</string>

<string>So, I'd have to admit, the military does a very good job of marketing itself to be very, very tough, very strong and very team-oriented. You can drive down any street and if you see a picture for the military, you might see someone in these, in this uniform, but in a very very movie style picture. And it's not always like that. For the most part, we're not soldiers. I'm not a soldier, I'm a sailor which is different than what many people think of the military. When you think, when many people think of the military, they think of a full-metal jacket, you know, with your hard hat, your helmet and, you know, walking around with a gun and to tell you the truth, I've never, you know, picked up a machine gun. The best I got was, like a little laser pointer in bootcamp. Otherwise, I've never, I've never seen a gun. So, the real military is a wide range of jobs. You have people working on the weapon system, you have people talking languages, you have people down in the nuclear plants, you have people that are cooks, you have people showing the jets how to move. But, what's really presented, what's romanticized is the basic soldier, you know, the Army style, the Marine style. So, the Navy's kind of different, in a good way.</string>

<string>The Navy is different than other branches in a lot of different ways but I think, about the second or third year that I was in the military, that I was in the Navy, I saw it as four different types, maybe five if you considered the Coast Guard. So, if you want to be the soldier that you hear about in the movies, then you join the Marines. They work out a lot more, they're the first people that start to fight the war. You have to, you know, be pretty strong and pretty brave, in the other branches too but more so for the Marines. If you want to be similar to the Marines but you want the tough lifestyle, you want the, you know, the rough, rugged fighting but you're more mechanically oriented, then you can try the Army. So, the Army, that's when you drive in tanks, that's when you set up communication systems in the middle of the desert. So, they're kind of Marines but they're not the first ones out there. If you want a, kind of, more civilian style job, then you join the Air Force. Air Force is known that you, it's known that you have some of the best equipment. For instance, at Travis Air Force Base, they have excellent golf clubs. They have, you have basically, a nine to five job. You can, kind of, sit in office many times. It's not always that case. You know, you can find lots of different jobs in any service but this is what was going on in my mind in the second year that I was in the Navy. So, the Navy is different from all of those. So, for instance, when you're on deployment, when you're six months, when you're traveling around in the middle of the ocean for six months, it's not like you're working out every day, also it's not a nine to five job in an office because you're working pretty much like, the whole day, you know, and it's not in an air conditioned office. It's sometimes down in the middle of the plants. The thing that the Navy has going for it is that you should be very technical. You should know your job better than any of your civilian counterparts. So, if you want to be known as someone who's like, pretty bright with when it comes to computers, when it comes to mechanical components, fixing machines, then the Navy is for you.</string>

<string>Some of the common misconceptions about being in the Navy, well, the biggest one I hear is, well, "How often do you swim?" and I'd say, "I can't even swim" and they're like "What? You know, you're in the Navy!" Yeah, you know, it's not like you're in the middle of the ocean and then you jump over the edge and you know, like, have a swim call or anything. You don't, I didn't really touch the water so much. So, the fact that you're on so many boats and you don't, you know, like touch the water at all for being in the Navy. That's a trip for a lot of people.</string>

<string>Something that I get asked pretty often about my job, being a nuclear technician is, "Wow, do you get to press the button?" and I'd always have to explain, "So, I'm an Electrician's Mate. As a nuclear technician, I don't really work with nuclear bombs." They get that confused. I didn't know. In fact, when I joined the military, I thought I was going to be working on nuclear bombs but the nuclear technology field is something different. We work on the engines and so, the nuclear technology that we're working with has nothing to do with exploding at all.</string>

<string>The Navy is very different than what I expected when I joined. I didn't really know that much about the military. My father was in the army and I should have had a better clue than what I did but I never, you know, I barely visited when he was in the army. He just came home and then, you know, took care of us. So, I had that same understanding that most people think about when they hear about them, the military, that is, that you're going to put on the hat, you're going to wear these clothes,you're going to, you know, go to foreign countries and fight wars. So, I did fight wars but I never really visited the country itself. My war was on a ship itself, on an aircraft owned by America. So, I didn't ever go to Iraq, I didn't ever go into Iran, I didn't ever go to Saudi Arabia. I didn't go to those places but I still fought the war, so that's kind of different than what I was expecting. I also bought into the mentality that everyday is going to be like P.T, physical training, good for you, good for me, but you barely work out. You are supposed to keep in shape. So, if you get overweight, then, you know, that could be a problem but for the Navy at least, as long as you meet the standards in the training which happens every six months, they make sure that you're not overweight, that you can do some push-ups and some sit-ups, then you're good to go and some people actually, they kind of skate around the system. So, people are a lot less fit than what I thought I would be doing. I thought I'd be like super buff, you know, model style but it's, that's not really expected of you.</string>

<string>When I started my career, then I was an E3, which is the third rank that you can be in the hierarchy. Not a lot was expected of me. I get to work, they say, "Go fix this pump", "Go work with that guy" and then at the end of the work day, around like four or five o'clock, then, probably not much was really expected of me. They'd say, you know, "Just go to your bed" or "We'll see you later". It depends on whether you're on deployment or whether you're stationed at home but you might have to work, maybe one or two hours extra every other day. However, as I progressed, when I became an E6, which is a first class or a Chief which is an E7, then, after that normal work day of telling people what to do, you know, you're there the same exact time as they are, you have to do, like, the follow up at the end. So, for instance, they get done at the end of the day. So, now that you have that information, while they get to go home or they get to, like, you know, have that downtime, you have to go report that to other people. You have to do the paperwork that other people are requiring. So, you have to wait till the normal work is done and then you have to add on the supervisory specialization that you have to give at the very very end. So, you work more as you get higher in the rank.</string>

<string>My view's changed for the military and a couple of ways. The first way is, that I understand the different roles of the military now. Before, I just thought we were just one big group, you go fight a war and I didn't know who did what but now, I see where we stand globally as far as, like, what branches do what service. Aircraft people, they stay pretty much on United States soil and then they send huge ships to do logistics. Marines, they're the ones who keep in really good shape so that they can go and get that first push when we start the war, when we start a battle. We have the Army people who like, provide support to the Marines and they fight themselves too, you know, but they're the ones like, shooting guns and stuff. So, like, you start to learn all of these things and later on, as a supervisor, you get more information about why we are doing things. So, for instance, why we're fighting in Iraq, why we are sending these planes over there and how the aircraft carrier can support them as opposed to like, when you're, you know, fresh on this ship, like, I don't know, I'm just here on this boat. I'm so &lt;word&gt;, fix that pump, that's all I know. So, you get more knowledgeable about things the longer you've been in.</string>

<string>I moved a lot when I was in the military and I'm really happy about that because you keep hearing about America and how it's different in different places. So, I got to visit the four corners of America and I got to see the different lifestyles. So, I grew up in Alabama which is, like, down south in a black community. Everybody around me, my neighbors, everyone was black and then, you know, you go to school that's mixed but I got to see that. I grew up some of my time in Flint, Michigan which is a very urban place but it's on the poorer side. So, that glove part, you know, I know all about that. And when I joined the military, then my first school was in Charleston, South Carolina which is another down south place but I got to see, you know, it's little bit more mixed. Then I went up to New York, Albany which is nice green country and I got to visit 'The New York City', you know, very often so that was really cool for me, to visit such a famous place. Later on, I got stationed in San Diego and it's super hot, well, it's good temperature, it can be very hot as opposed to New York which was freezing cold and it's a very big city. You know, it's my style of, I'm not a country backwards boy, you know, like, climbing mountains and hunting. I am a city guy myself. So, I got to see San Diego which is, like, I'm from California originally so that's up my tree. And then, I finally got to visit Bremerton, Washington which is in the middle of Washington state and it's kind of country, you can own bigger houses there, you know, for much cheaper. So, it's much less expensive than California and I knew a lot of people who used to be Californians but then they, you know, changed over to Washington because the life is a lot easier. They liked having a five bedroom house with a big green yard for the kids to play in and nice and quiet neighborhoods, you know, so, a lot of people change. So, I got to see all those and eventually, I realized out of all the places that I visited in America, I'm a California guy.</string>

<string>My career field is very very unique. From what I understand, 60% of the nuclear technicians out there in the world come from the Navy. So, I'm a nuclear technician. I don't think that I would have had his training had I not joined the military itself. So, being a nuke is very very specific. You know, there aren't that many places that have it, the nuclear power plants up along the edges of America and there are the subs in the ships of the United States Navy. So, that's very unique in itself.</string>

<string>Are great practitioners of this field made or born? I would say that it's a little bit of both. Now, there's some psychology here. I do believe that when you're born, you have certain innate abilities, comes from your mom and your dad, comes from your race. Some of us are different skinned, some of us are taller or shorter, some of us are, you know, stronger based on your genes and I also think that, like, your mind is, it follows the same trait, you know, like everybody's different. Some people are artists when they're born, some people are engineers when they're born. However it depends on how you grow up. So, you can take someone who's an artist as a kid and then you can train them through their lives to become a great engineer. Now, maybe they might not be the best engineer because it's not in their bodies but they can do a good job, a great job in fact. So, it's a combination of both. It depends on who your mom and your dad were. Hopefully, you got that training, whatever training that you want to be and later on in your life but if you don't, the military, who realizes this, can train anybody to do anything. So, some people will have to do a lot more work to achieve their goals. Some people can, for instance, join the nuclear field like I am and it can be a breeze for them. Some people might have to put in the work, but regardless of that fact, they can take anybody, whether you're an expert from birth or whether you need to put some time in it and they'll make sure that you do the pipeline so that you can do the job well.</string>

<string>Some of the priorities that I would suggest for someone entering the field, well, me personally, once I found out that I was going to become a nuke, become a nuclear technician, I guess I wasn't going to, for about seven months or eight months, so I took some community college classes to, kind of, brush up on some of the physics, some of the math and I have to tell you, that was a very big benefit. I didn't know anything about physics, like, for instance, I didn't know like, what happened with gravity and shooting bullets and stuff and some common things that I would have gotten wrong but because I took those college classes, that helped me prepare myself better to do well in A school. Because I did well in A school that, you know, like, set me off on a big career path later on. But it's not just like, nuclear technician, it could be, for instance, electronics technician. You might want to brush up on some of your voltage and your current and your resistors. You could be a cook. You might want to brush up on, like, the different specialties of the flavors that you're going to be using or you know, ask some other cooks out there, like, "What does it take to be good at my job?" So, just kind of understand the field that you're going into and try to learn about as much of it as you can beforehand.</string>

<string>So, the fairness in the Navy, it, I have to say that the military is fair. However, they have some intricacies that I have to say. So, for instance, let's say the economy does poorly. Then the President is to blame. Now, no one's going to say, well, "You know, President, you are the one that caused that entire city to be downgraded." It wasn't his job, you know, like, maybe it's the President before him. However, he takes responsibility for it. So, there's a lot of responsibility taking for things that you don't directly control but because it was under your guidance, you are the one that, who people look to, whether it was your fault or not. So, if for instance, my military unit has many people that aren't physically fit, then they're going to say, "Chief, what is wrong with your unit?" Now, I don't have any excuse. I could say, well, "You know, I tell them to work out and they just don't listen." I could grab them by the collar and like, try to run with them but in the end, the people that are working for you, it's their, it's under their cognizance and you just take responsibility for it. So, is that fair? In many cases, you might not think that it is fair but that's the system that we play by and as long as you're familiar with those rules, then that kind of motivates you to be more involved in the things that you're supervising, to make sure that they go right.</string>

<string>If you try your best or you follow the directions as good as you can, then you have my word, you have nothing to worry about. If something goes wrong, for instance, like, let's say that there's a piece of equipment that doesn't work the right way and you can't complete your mission, then, of course, they might say, "You know what, like, you should have done more preventive maintenance on it or you should have looked at it better", but no one's going to fault you for that. If for instance, something else goes wrong that you tried your best to complete and for some reason, it doesn't work out the way that you expect, then you might get talked to, you might get, you know, because the responsibility is there, someone has to blame someone and it could be you but you won't get punished for it, which is something that I'm very proud about for the Navy. They're not going to bash people for doing quality work.</string>

<string>So when you come into the military from day one you are provided with many opportunities to grow and expand yourself. So, even in boot camp, some of the tasks that they provide for you, that they ask you to do are kind of complex. So some people, let's say they were really good in high school. It can be very easy for them, they understand the math that's involved, they understand how how the physics works, how to tie the knot. But for some people it could be the first time that they've ever seen it in their lives. Maybe they've never even been on a ship before you know so be a lot harder for them. So, the cool thing about the navy is that it gives you all the resources that you need, hands down. So if you don't need it then you probably won't use it but if you do need it then it's all a matter of asking a chief "Hey where can I get help" or a matter of going to your local library and getting that book. The biggest thing is that there's gonna be someone to your left and someone to your right that can work with you hand in hand to make sure that you complete your job. But what the Navy doesn't want is someone who can't do their job who is trying to do their job because that's gonna get someone killed. So they make sure that whether it's tying a knot or painting a ship or it's going down and fixing the pump they're gonna make sure that you can complete your job and if there's any question to it then they're not gonna allow you to do it so.</string>

<string>The bosses that I've had in the navy have been varied. Some of them I've got along with greatly but others they- in many cases it it depends on the type of personality that they have and just like with anyone, somtimes you make friends sometimes you make enemies if you can say that. So most people are just somewhere in the middle so the people that you would have a beer with in real life, those the people you can joke around with, those are the people that understand your personality and they're the ones who respect your work the best. However I gotta say that many people think that the military can be political, so for instance you could have a work center that has like four or five people and then you can have a supervisor for them and you can see that the supervisor has a better communication with you know two or three people in the unit. So the quiet person who barely ever talks to that supervisor could get frustrated in the fact that his work isn't being recognized the way that it should. So I've had that personal problem too. But it is what it is. You just take an average of your whole entire career. Sometimes you will be a superstar and sometimes you are gonna be kinda like the bottom of the list. But for the most part as long as you you present a good effort then you'll be successful. I made it to chief, so it seems like most of what I've been doing with my bosses has been on the positive side.</string>

<string>So some of the technology that I worked on in my career as a nuclear technician, it's kind of divided into two parts because the nuclear technology field is divided into two parts. The first one is electrical things, I'm an Electrician's Mate, so I used many components like a watt meter, a volt meter, oscilloscope these are all equipment that you use to touch things around the plant to get readings on them. See what their oil level is, see what they're voltage is, see what the current is, see what the power is. So they're really used all throughout America as electricians as use them. The other part of my job, the nuclear technology field, is very specific most of the time. But if you think of Homer Simpson, he was a nuclear technologist. It only deals with things that the uranium cycle can do to make power. So some of things that I worked on deal with the nuclear part of the aircraft carrier and the way that it makes the ship run. So for instance it makes electricity. So for instance I worked with turbine generators. The nuclear technology of the aircraft carrier makes steam, so the steam will power lots of different things all around the ship. So all of the valves that it takes to make sure that the steam goes to the right places, so that a spin pumps, or to move the screws of the aircraft carrier so that it can move through the water. All of those are things I dealt with as far as technology.</string>

<string>With nuclear energy, maybe because I have a bias because I went through the program but what's really pushed upon us is that it's very safe. It's one of the safest ways to make energy that we have. Now there is a concern about nuclear waste and of course you know we have nuclear waste at the end of an aircraft carrier's life cycle, but it's controlled in a certain spot and we put in the middle of the ground as opposed so let's say charcoal which produces fumes in the air as opposed to sunlight which doesn't provide the energy for the surface area that it has , to produce as much as the nuclear power that is. As opposed to wind which requires these big things in far off places. So nuclear technology can be built anywhere in a safe manner, and in fact the navy has a history of zero incidents of nuclear failures in the navy's history, so we're really proud of that. I think that nuclear technology should be the way to go for our future energy needs; however, I do understand people's hesitation with taking on nuclear power, especially with the thing that happened in Japan-the great Japanese earthquake in 2001. So it's been a big problem to try to pick up all of the all the pieces there. They still have problems with it, even though it has been you know like eight years later. However that took a huge natural disaster to cause a problem that day, so whether it's charcoal whether it's sunlight you know no matter what, when you have a big earthquake like that then that is going to happen but otherwise nuclear power is one of the safest ways to make energy that I know of, and that's what we are taught.</string>

<string>The organizations most helpful to me number one has to be the military healthcare system so I think I hurt my thumb I also sprained my foot really bad and one thing that you don't really have to worry about being in the military is the top of this head to the bottom of your feet- it's all taken care of. You might have to pay a little bit more for your family but other than that the rates are really cheap and it's very convenient. Another thing that I think of, another association I think of when I think of the military that is actually on the fun level is MWR. Without MWR I would have a hugely different impression of the military but they throughout my whole entire career if I ever wanted to play pool, if I ever wanted to bowl, if I ever wanted to go hiking, skiing, camping, they were right there with super friendly people to make sure that our work outside of our hard military life is rewarded. And finally I have to give my credit to the USO. Whenever I go to an aircraft carrier they're the nicest sweetest people. They give me hot dogs, cakes, cookies, they provide me a place to sleep, they allow me to put my bags down, especially when I want to walk around the aircraft carrier without being over burdened. I see other people out there waiting in these long lines, back up against the wall with the kids and then I see the USO people and their military families having the time of their lives even though it's a five hour flight. So hats off to USO.</string>

<string>MWR stands for morale, recreation, and welfare. That's basically the military's leisure association, you go in there you can ask them anything from hiking equipment, camping equipment, maybe they can show you a place to shoot guns. If you're in a foreign country they can tell you all the different places around %HESITATION that you can %HESITATION enjoy yourself. So for instance in San Diego, they told us where Disneyland is, Seaworld, %HESITATION how to go to Mexico safely, how to go to Las Vegas, all the things that are around San Diego. They also give you cheaper rates than civilians can get. So basically if you're in any place that has MWR that's the first place to go when you want to try to do something fun out in the community.</string>

<string>USO stands for the United Services Organization. I don't specifically know like why they were formed but I I know that a lot of people who are associated with the military before, maybe they're veterans themselves, maybe it's the wife of someone in the military, maybe it's someone who just has a lot of respect for the military. They come and they volunteer their time to show their respect to the military in lots of ways. The way that I know is that they're at airports and they have a little building off to the side or maybe they're on the second level of the airport where you can go in and you can rest, you can eat some of their food, you can have conversations with other people on similar flights, and it's really convenient. I'm sure that they do other things as well so I wanna give them credit for that but the way that I know them is from their support at the airports.</string>

<string>You might want to try to develop yourself into the best sailor that you can be, and when you do that, when you want to try to do that, that means that you have to take on jobs that aren't usually easy. So it all began when I joined the join the military. At first I had the opportunity to take normal jobs, slightly higher jobs, and in their most advanced field, nuclear technology. So that's what I chose to do. I didn't take the easy route in that case and for me it worked out really well. As I became a nuclear technician then lots of jobs start popping up for you so again you have to decide well do I want to have an easy life, have a normal nine to five job. Do I want to go home at the end of the night or should I try this supervisory position that you hear that they have to stay on the ship later, they have more responsibly put on them, they're blamed a lot more for things. So basically you have to make your life worse some people would say, but I think it's just more responsible. Just like with any job the more responsibility you take, the more risks you have of getting in trouble now because you're taking care of this work center your blamed for that work center if something goes wrong. However if you can do your good job and have that work center be better because of you. You tell the people what to do and they have less of incidence of failure you bring your boss down there and say well this is the way it used to be but I told this person to do X, this person to do Y and now this person is better because of that. So now that supervisor that's in front of you will give you an award for that so the only way to progress yourself, to become a chief, senior chief, master chief, is to put yourself in that role to take on those risks of failure and ultimately reap the rewards.</string>

<string>I went to college after I did the military. I think that's one way to do it, but you have a wide range of opportunities for college. If you ask if you should go to college before you start serving that depends on what you wanna do. If you wanna have a very good enlisted career, and you don't plan on becoming an officer then I suggest that you join the military right away. Officers need a college degree, so if you get the college degree first then you can become an officer as soon as you join the military. You can apply to become an officer and every year thereafter, however you probably wouldn't start your career four years later. So that could be a hindrance if you wanna have a full enlisted career. For people that aren't sure what the what they want to do, I still suggest that they join the military right away because you can go to school while you're in the military. I took a few classes myself. So if you decide that college isn't for you then you didn't waste those four years. Also military college can be free in many cases. It can be very very cheap, they have the tuition assistance that can reduce the price by a few thousand dollars or ultimately make it free and you can down take lots of classes during your off time. So that means you can kill two birds with one stone, you can get the work experience and you can do college at night time. For some people like me, I didn't want the military work to interfere with my school. I wanted to get As, so that's why even though I wanted to go to school the entire time that I was in the military, I waited until I got out so I could use the Montgomery GI Bill, so I could go to a very expensive university, and so that I could really focus on my school without worrying about work in the middle. So between going to school in the beginning if you want to become an officer, going to school during your career if you're thinking about making the military a career itself, or doing college at the very end, so you can enjoy the Montgomery GI Bill, the post 9-11 benefits, and all the free stuff. You have to decide where you fit in that range.</string>

<string>I think that that the navy change the world, the military can change the world, and ultimately America can change the world if we use the money that we are spending for the military wisely. So America spends I think six hundred billion dollars per year, which is from what I understand several times more than any other country. It's maybe the next six countries combined total, that's what the military spends. So what are we using that money for I would say that it's policing the world. We make sure that we have a huge military so that there aren't huge fights breaking out all over the world like it used to be two hundred three hundred years ago because there wasn't a main force. Then you have England attack France, Iraq attack Saudi Arabia, I'm making up countries but you understand that there wasn't a global force for good making sure that everybody isn't going crazy with all the attacking. So yes America does attack itself too and there's an ideology behind that. But ultimately as long as America can control the huge fights that break out then I'd say that people for the most part in most countries will appreciate that protection that we are providing.</string>

<string>My favorite book of all time I have to say is Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse. So I grew up reading mythology, Greek mythology, and maybe magic books, and a few sports books, lots of fables and Aesop's fables, so that's what got me to read. But I didn't really I don't see any very substantial work that you know sold lots of intelligence and Hermann Hesse's work Siddhartha was just what I needed to realize that there are some really bright people out there way brighter than I am who can think of some kind of plot that's very interesting and engaging and Siddhartha, the main character of the story is a lot like me. He's introverted, he's wondering about his future, he travels the world looking for some kind of solution and the solution is, an answer is given in the book, I don't know if it's a solution, but it made me really self introspect a lot, and I started to read all of Hermann Hesse's work later on and most of it just blew me away so it's a good introduction to very intelligent reading.</string>

<string>I like a lot of the pop movies like Titanic, Braveheart, Forrest Gump like a lot of the blockbusters but I have to say that my favorite movie of all time is actually not even a movie, it's an anime from Japan. I'm in Japan so I you see lots of anime and many of them are good but one blows everything out the water. Berserk is a movie about the medieval times, and there's this character Guts who is really strong and you know he wants to fight his own personal battles by himself but not really think about anything, no purpose but he meets this person Griffin who's very charismatic and he has this huge goal to like own his own kingdom and Guts sees this so he follows him and you know there's lots of romance, lots of blood and guts, lots of intellectual conversation, and believe it or not I actually thought a lot about my own life very much throughout this movie, so hats off to those guys who made that really bright anime.</string>

<string>If I could meet anyone in the world then I think it would have to be Sam Harris. There's a lot of people I respect. There's Stephen Hawking who is a really great guy, I'm actually working on a project here at my computer science that can help him speak. There are smart guys like Neil Degrasse Tyson, he's a physicist who is really bright. He just narrated the most recent Cosmos about the planets in the world just like Carl Sagan did back in the day, so a really bright guy but those are the people that can teach me something, I don't think that I could provide anything to them. I don't think that our conversations would be on the same plane. But Sam Harris, he's a person who kinda like Richard Dawkins, he's an atheist and he has ideas about different religions and he's also a computer scientist who has ideas about artificial intelligence. He has lots of different ideas to talk about I think that can make for excellent conversation. I disagree with him about a lot of things and I think that he could actually change my mind about a lot of things which is why I wanna meet him.</string>

<string>I get lots of personal satisfaction from my job. Of course the salary is no joke I make decent money, enough to live and enough to support myself, but the skills that they provide they really go pretty far. Whenever I mention the type of work that I do, people's eyes light up and it makes me really proud of being able to say that I work with nuclear technology. Other sources of pride come in the fact that it's not everybody that can actually push an aircraft carrier through the water and I can actually say that my hands touched something that made this huge multibillion dollar piece of equipment go through the water to fight a war. It was me. If I push it twisted this way it would've stopped or did it this way it goes fast. So that's a once in a lifetime experience and adventure.</string>

<string>When recruiters look for new people to come and join the navy, they're looking for special special ideology not a special skill set. You can come in with nothing. You can come in with your GED, you can come in with C's like I did from high school and they will train you, that's not a problem. The ideology that I'm talking about is the fact that you need to be able to follow instructions. So for instance if you always got in trouble all the time and you can't follow directions, then that is a hit. A lot of people that would have went to jail still join the military because the judge thinks that they have the potential to follow directions if in the right situation. So the biggest quality that recruiters look for when they ask people to join the navy is "Will you do what I tell you to do? Will you do what your supervisor tells you to do? Are you going to be drunk and get kicked out of military right away?" If you sexually harass people then that's a big no-no. So someone who is moral, someone who follow directions, that's what they're looking for.</string>

<string>The major problem that I see military people having working in the field today is that they can probably expect to go to more wars if our current leadership doesn't take the right actions to prevent that. We're supposed to be policing the world in a way that prevents large drawn out wars but unfortunately, with a lot of things that are happening in the Yellow Sea right now, with a lot of things happening with North Korea with their buildup of their weapon arsenal, with some the things going on in the Middle East. We can see that the policing that we're doing isn't fully effective in the way that we are seeing decreases in the level of violence around the world. We are seeing the same or even more than when I was in the military, so that could be something that we can look forward to in the military from now on.</string>

<string>In my profession as an electrician I look up to a lot of people. At least in my work center of course I'm always going to be turning to the person right beside me, the senior chief or even the master chief of the command to kind of give me directions so that I can become a better chief myself. I expect them to tell me when I'm messing up. I expect them to kinda correct me in a lot of situations and to give me lots of advice. So, in my work center it's going to be the next person, next enlisted person in front of me. However, as an electrician I also have a lot of respect for the academic side of the science. So for instance when I read about things, read about nuclear technology things and the way they are improving from MIT or from Berkeley or from other places that, you know, promote nuclear technology then I'm really proud of them as well, and that's why I started becoming a university student myself because I want to follow in that direction. I see our tech, our engineering field has a lot of room to expand and I want to be a part of that. So I look to people promoting engineering marvels.</string>

<string>One of the fun stories that I have was when I was in Australia I started, I started to gamble. I never gambled before I wanted to see if I could take one thousand dollars and make ten thousand dollars. I said you know, I'm going to into this five star hotel you know, gambling on the bottom and I said I can stop. Ten thousand dollars that's enough for a car. I will come back and I won't gamble anymore I'll go out into the world. I had this trick that I could do for roulette which is like you take one dollar and if you lose it then you bet two dollars, if you lose it then you bet four dollars, if you lose then you bet eight dollars and eventually you're gonna win you know. Even if you lose lose lose lose lose lose lose lose lose, if you win on that tenth time as long as you keep doubling then you get all your money back and you know. So anyways I tried this trick. So we went to Australia and I was down in the bottom of the hotel and I was there for maybe seven hours six hours on my roulette wheel. So I started off with a hundred, I actually did Black Jack and I got into like two three hundred and I started roulette you know with my special trick and I got it up to two thousand dollars. So I'm like "ah I'm on my way you know it actually does work." So I went up to my room for that night, I was drinking champagne in the bathtub like watching TV you know and then I thought like wait a second I'm in Australia. Clint. Did you just spend your whole day in the gambling in a little you know off to the side hotel and gambling spot you know like like you can gamble in Las Vegas come on you know you should you should get out there and try to explore the country some. So the next day I go back down there and it's so funny there's this old lady who was there and she was there the night before, right. I went up to you know like take a nap and drink and I came back and she was still gambling right. So she was gambling on the hundred dollar chip tables and before I was doing like ten, ten dollar tables so I was like you know what? Here is my money let me go ahead and you know try to get this ten thousand dollars as fast as possible. So I go to right beside her, you know she is the only one at the table. Start betting hundred dollars, hundred dollars, hundred dollars. It's all gone. Whoop- bye two thousand dollars. I mean I left and I enjoyed Australia so. I like that story because it taught me to not be scared of losing money. Money didn't have that power over me that I did when I was, when I was a kid.</string>

<string>Japan, for me, has been one of the most awesome experiences of my life. This is the third time that I have come here. The first was with the military, I want to Sasebo which is at the very bottom of Japan kind of like a country version of Japan, but I did go to a big city, Fukuoka, and it was really big, really huge they have amazing stores. The electronics store that I went to it was, it had like ten floors and one of the floors is like Best Buy in America. Best Buy is America's most most most, it has the most electronic stuff that America can provide and it's on one big you know humongus floor but Japan has eight of those guys like if you want a camera at Best Buy well here's a stand you know you can see below there's fifty cameras, oh cool. No no, you haven't seen cameras until you go to Japan where they have an entire section of a floor devoted to cameras. You want a laptop okay at the you know Best Buy has this there's the apple section there's like you know twenty, twenty laptops over there you know. Japan is the place so. As far as the food goes, I switch over. When I'm in America I love ice cream, when I'm in Japan it switches over to ramen. Ramen is the best delicious food that has every went into my body it's so good. There was one time I ate ramen every single day. Also enemy is, it's abundant over here so I don't really watch anime here. It's amazing that I watch anime more in America than here, cause it's kind of kid like here, but you see it all, on all places like whenever you are walking down the street you can see like a cartoon figure and all the pop characters you know, they have places like na-na-na-na you have to, you have to go visit it, it's so funny. Just being in this different culture, it's way different than America, and I'm digging it.</string>

<string>Computer science is broken up into basically two different forms. The first one is computer science itself, which is everything that's associated with the laptop that's in front of you. That includes the theory that's behind it, the abstractions that are associated with thinking about the way that you know, computers should work. That involves the electronics that are behind it, you open up the computer and you can see the mother board, you can see the resistors, you can see the current that's traveling through it. So that's the hardware portion, that's the thing that's on the screen that deals with web design that deals with the way that the colors look, also graphics. That's how the light comes from the computer and hits your eyes. There's the user experience part which is when you have buttons all over the screen, and maybe this button shouldn't be like here, maybe people want it bigger or smaller, maybe they want it on the other side screen. Maybe they think that it's boring, but if you change it in a certain way so that it's more fun. So that's, all of that combined is computer science. But what most people think about when they think of computer science is actually the coding part. Coding is what happens when you have your laptop open, you open up a program and you start pushing buttons on your computer screen to write lines of code so that when you compile it, you press play, it does something for you. So for instance you can make a game, you compile the game and all of a sudden you can play the game. Or you can make, you can start coding and then when you press play, you have Microsoft Word based on the code that you wrote. So that's what most people think about when they think of computer science, they think of the program that's associated with it, but computer science is a very broad range.</string>

<string>When there's something that's, that's really difficult, there's some kind of obstacle in, in my life then the thing that I fall back to most are the people around me which is my, my, my friends and a lot of people they have a family to support them. Unfortunately I don't have any family that's around me but I do have a close group of friends that I can confide in whenever something is bugging me.</string>

<string>The biggest advice that I could present to somebody who went through a tough life similar to me. My life wasn't extremely tough, it's the way that I looked at it, other people would say that I had a tough life. I mean I've seen roaches in my bathroom I've had mice crawl over my feet. I've, I've smelled gunpowder you know, from outside. I've had a pimp you know, hit his prostitute outside my door. These are things that I've experienced and I gotta say you know, as much as, as strong as I want to be for saying you know, it didn't affect me I'm strong but I think that you know, it really changed my life and I know that a lot of people, especially ones that join the military have had similar careers you know my story is not unique. So I think one of the things that has helped me in order to look at my past better is to have different experiences. Another thing that I'm proud of is the fact that my dad was in the army and I got to go to Germany. So just being in that other environment, being surrounded by German kids, needing to speak the German language, you know eating bratwurst you don't like, having that different experience allowed me to come back to Flint and say you know, this isn't life, this is one part of life, but there are people in Florida that are you know going to Disneyland, people in Germany you know doing Octoberfest, there are people in Japan you know eating Ramanan watching anime. This is just one small sliver, and if you can somehow escape from that environment, or even maybe do something within that environment to make it better you know, then you can see that you don't have to be disheartened by your, by your surroundings. It's just what you make of it.</string>

<string>When I was a kid, I used to wear these glasses, I used to be a lot skinnier than I am, I'm a big chubby guy now but I was your scrawny nerd so I had my two or three friends you know, we used to play video games and dungeons and dragons all the time and yeah you know that's ripe picking for bullies. But I think I've been in you know a couple fights in my life, just barely you know like little scuffs and no big deal. However I happen to think that I was at least a decent looking enough to where girls would kinda like me too, so it didn't really affect my personal you know, my personal idea of myself. I just thought well you know one day I'm gonna get older, I'm probably gonna have a good job I'm gonna have nice cars, and you know so, the bullies are picking on me you know, it's, they're probably gonna become losers later on in life. So that's the way that I thought when I was younger so.</string>

<string>The advice that I have for someone being bullied, it depends on how you want to look at it. My advice that I did for myself was that I just stayed in my own little world. Yeah I wasn't very sociable as a kid, but something else that I did that actually changed it, I don't suggest this but this is what happened for me, and it stopped me from being bullied, was that I changed myself. I realized that after I put in contacts and took off my glasses, and I start working out you know, I was working out, I was on the track and field club so I ran all the time and I could notice my muscles getting bigger, my chest you know I could shake them. I had a six pack you know, I realized that after I did that, all of the bullying stopped. I don't suggest that because you should be whoever you want to be. I mean because I didn't change myself like that to stop the bullying, I changed myself because that's the person that I wanted to be, you know. I liked not having glasses you know hurt my nose, I liked working out because you know it made me more energetic, but %HESITATION whether you stay yourself or whether you have a different personality or you know you change your look or your feel, all that doesn't matter. The only thing that I can suggest if you are getting bullied is to realize that you're somebody, that you're gonna be somebody great later on in life if you, if you apply yourself and to not let those words sink in.</string>

<string>Currently at the moment, I don't have any close people around me, I don't really have a family. Of course everybody has a mom and a dad but I, like so many other people in the military had a dysfunctional family when I was growing up. My mom and my dad split when I was young, and so I had to live with my mom's mom, my dad's mom, my mom, then my dad and then I did that again you know. So I lived with each of them like two years, two years, two years, two years, then did that one more time and then when I was eighteen I kind of just went my own way and I didn't really talk to them anywhere after that.</string>

<string>If you have a spouse, a husband or wife, or even another boyfriend or girlfriend who you are very close to doesn't really understand the requirements of the navy, I would suggest that the military person present them with some of the support that the military provides. You have MWR, Morale Recreation and Welfare that can show the spouse or significant other, number one, ways that they can divert themselves. If your, let's say husband is out in the ocean you could find yourself very bored, you can find yourself wanting to be around them, to call them all the time. So MWR can show you how to like mingle with other military people, with other military spouses, with other people in the community to kinda like take your mind off  ofthem. They can also provide them with legal support if they're running into some problems while the the husband or wife is away. So as long as the military person shows the spouse all of the support, then they shouldn't, they can overcome their problems.</string>

<string>Personally I love wearing this uniform in particular. The reason I love this uniform is because it doesn't need to be ironed. To tell you the truth you just throw it in the wash machine and then as soon as it comes out you just "whosh" and put it on a hanger and then it's ready to wear. Sometimes I iron it just to make sure there's absolutely no wrinkles, wrinkles, creases, wrinkles but I think that it's very warm. I like the way that it looks. And it's very easy to maintain.</string>

<string>So a regulator, it has different meanings depending on what type of job you're doing. So if you ask a mechanic what a regulator is, it's something that regulates some kind of flow. So for instance you could have water going in this direction and then you maybe turn a switch or apply some, some setting to a control mechanism that separates it into different, different paths. So let's say need a little bit of water and you have a lot of water over here then you regulate it so that only a little bit flows out. But let's say you need lots of water here, then you regulate it so that there's lots of water that comes out. So the same thing happens with an electrician, my job. We have voltage regulators so let's say you have a pump that needs twenty volts and you have a machine that can provide all of that, you just don't wanna pump all of the current from that machine into that little, little box, right. So you have a regulator that provides the right voltage so that that voltage will just allow the correct current to go through that machine. That's a voltage regulator.</string>

<string>The Naval Postgraduate School is basically the Navy's main school for officers who probably came from the Naval Academy or maybe ROTC, that are advanced in their career enough maybe after four years or six years, to go back to graduate school to get an advanced degre. So they allow Master's courses and things from security to operations management, basically lots of war things. I was thinking about going there myself to get a degree in modeling virtual environments and simulation, it's a computer science field but there are things like applied math, things that keep our Navy in tip top shape for the people that are really controlling things at that level.</string>

<string>The most important things that you can put on a resume are, number one how you worked as a team concerning the job that is being applied for. So for instance if I was applying to be a mechanic on a submarine, then I'd have to look at my past and say okay well what things are associated with the submarine, right, and then that I did in my past life, and then how did I work as a team to make that project better. So maybe you were a car mechanic before and you're trying to apply for this mechanical job, then you're gonna talk about the other teammates on your car engineer team that you talk to, that you provided support to, that you supervised, and obviously the dates so that they can see that you have a big range of experience with that.</string>

<string>There are many opportunities for internships if you're going into the stem field. I know that I had an internship myself at the Department of Defense. I worked at the Naval training station in Orlando and it was my first internship, it dealt with computer science. I was working on making speech more understandable for a computer as you talk to it, so that was really good. So I think the Department of Defense, I think you just Google DOD internships and press enter and then there's, probably the whole first there's lots of different postings for you. So at every military installation, let's say in California at Corona, at San Diego, at SWRMC (South West Regional Maintenence Center), at even the San Diego Naval base. There's probably some opportunity for high school students and college graduates to get a little bit of taste of what the federal government and what the military can offer for military careers.</string>

<string>The best information that I could give you if you're trying to understand what you should do for your future career is to learn as much information about it as possible. So for me I joined the nuclear technician field and I didn't even know what they did. I thought we were going to be working on nuclear bombs and I think if I would have known a little bit more about it then I would've had better jump start for my career. So for instance if I knew about like, that the nuclear technology field dealt with the internals of making nuclear power with uranium, then I would study more about that, and my schooling would had a better, I would've understood my schooling a lot better. If I would have picked up a little bit of electrician knowledge beforehand, like for instance, I had no idea what the difference between voltage and current was until I was midway in my A school, my initial school learning. So it would be really nice if I would have understood some of those basic concepts before I started the school. My grades would have been higher, I would have gotten more awards, maybe I would've understood the material, the complex material that was being presented to me in a much, in a much better way if I would've had like fifty or sixty percent knowledge beforehand. So I wouldn't have missed out on all of those like. those minor advanced topics during class. So I guess my advice is learn about your job before you go into it.</string>

<string>Trying to find what you love to do, it has two brought answers for me. The first of which is you hear this very often, follow your passion. So personally my passion was music and art. I wasn't an engineer person per se, when I was a kid all the way up until a couple years after I joined the navy. That's right, I joined as an engineer and I wasn't an engineer until after I got to my first ship. I, to tell you the truth, I didn't even like it too much. I like talking languages, and you know conversing with people, and you know writing stuff, and typing on the computer. I did not want to see oil, I did not want to touch a wrench you know, that wasn't for me, but in the end, it brings me to my second point. Try to become really good at the skills that you possess. So for me, I think I'm a good electrician. I became a supervisor after some time, and it's not because I had a passion for electrician things, it's because I found that I was good at it, and that gave me motivation to learn more and more about it, and once I started doing that then it became easy for me. And after it becomes easy for you, then you can start explaining things really well, you can start reading a book and learning more about it really well, you start getting awards for it, you start you know wanting to know more about it. So yeah those two things: follow your passion and if that's not for you, then follow the skills that are provided to you.</string>

<string>If you don't know what job you want to do, then my suggestion is that try to push yourself to try to do as hard a job as possible. You can always go down but in many cases it's very hard to go up. So for instance if you pick a simple job like let's say picking plants. I don't mean to discredit any plant pickers out there, but if your job is to pick plants, and then all of sudden you want to be a computer scientist, let's say, it might be hard to try to make that switch. You don't have the skills to do computer science, you don't have the background, you might not have the right way to think about the world. However, I think as a computer scientists, if I wanted to, I could be a very good plant picker, so you can always go down but it's hard to go up.</string>

<string>The best people to talk to if you're unsure about what you want to do is the people in the field if you can. So I know many people will ask their their dad "Hey dad should I join the Navy?" And I gotta say if your dad has never been in the Navy, then although his advice should be considered, he might not know what he's talking about. The best thing to do would be to ask someone who's been in the military, and the longer the time the better. So for instance, you don't want to ask your cousin Joe who just got back from boot camp what the military's like. He's probably not gonna give you a fully formed answer. You want to ask the senior chief who can give you from the outs and in, the deployments, to the ward, to the sitting at home, to the long days, to the long nights, to the easy vacations and the full spectrum. So get people with experience.</string>

<string>The person that gave me the best advice about joining the military I'd have to say would be my father. He was in the army and although I never saw him while he was at work, well just barely, it was as a kid you know, I sit in the corner playing video games or something with my gameboy. But he did tell me you know, when he came home what his day was like. He'd say some of the things about the work they have to do, the PT that he had to do, the people he had to supervise. I also saw the type of life that we lived in. I know that like it was a very nice clean environment, he showed me his corvette outside and we took it for a spin a few times. We would always be going on vacations, and he'd tell me like these are the benefits that are associated with the military, any he'd develop my pride and my motivation to join later on you know. If he wouldn't have been in the army, maybe who's to say that I would have joined myself, but military families have a high rate of convincing other people around them to join.</string>

<string>So one thing that I regret when I was growing up is that, although I was a really good student when I was in elementary school, when I was in middle school, and even high school, then things started to kind of fall off and kind of whither away. I didn't have a strong relationship with my family so I kinda just did my own thing, I was very independent and unfortunately I wasn't really good at doing homework and stuff. So yeah, I got the first F in my life when I was a senior, first D's you know as a junior, and you know I mean, if I would have just kept being an awesome student throughout high school, then who is to say that my life wouldn''t have gone in a completely different direction. Maybe I could have wound up at an Ivy League school or something. Who knows? But because I didn't listen to my mom and dad tell me to do my homework and you know eat my vegetables, then I had, I was almost forced to join the military. I'm glad that I did join the military, it gave me an option to you know make something of myself, but I think I would have had a lot more opportunities if I would have listened to my parents.</string>

<string>When I was a kid, I went to the library one day and I got this book, and it showed me all of the salaries that people make. I was a musician at that time, I never played any music or instrument, but like I knew that you know, like I was really involved in music and I wanted to. So then I saw how much musicians make and it's very very low, and okay well I'm artist at least you know like maybe about drawing, I get my art history from my mom and I looked at their salaries and it was very low. So then I set shut that book and then I kind of gave up on looking at salaries for awhile. A question that I would have, a question that I wish I would asked someone, is what are the different salaries that people can make and how can I become more involved in getting those high paying, those high paying jobs. And not only that, let's say I wanted to be an artist or a musician, how do I enter that field without being discouraged by their salaries. So how can I follow my passion without being disheartened by financial figures.</string>

<string>Something I wish I would have known before I chose nuclear technology, is how cool computer science could be. When I was a kid I was just thinking computer science what you know, they type all day and there's like ones and zeroes and it's terrible and you know lots of math, very complex for no reason. That's what I thought, but after I got out I realized woah wait a second, I can make games? And it's not that difficult, you know there are tools to help you so you aren't dealing with ones and zeroes, you can deal with like normal conversation when you code? Aw man. So I wish number one, I wish my dad would have bought me a computer when I was a kid, and that didn't happen. So number two, before I joined nuclear tech, as a nuclear technologist you know as an Electrician's Mate, and I wish someone would have told me about other computer science fields, because that's what I'm doing now that's my passion, you could say.</string>

<string>The most, the most challenging part of my job is probably being able to manage everything that's given to you without really fussing about it. Some things you agree with, some things you won't agree with, and you have to make sure that the part that you agree with, you know you say it very, very clearly to your people. The parts that you don't agree with, sometimes you have to actually tell your boss hey you know what it's better this way, and whatever answer you get is whether you know you can convince him or whether you have the materials that it takes to convince him, otherwise you have to be strong in whatever your convictions are and present it to your people. So it's very good to take all of your input, everything that everybody's trying to tell you, and make sure that you understand it correctly and that you can present it correctly. That's probably the most challenging part of my job.</string>

<string>The biggest barrier to entry, to join the navy, and basically the military in general, is that you have to be able to follow directions. And even though that sounds like a very small task, it shows up everywhere in everything that you do, from from doing the simplest of tasks to writing your name to you know making a list of things to do in a complex procedure you know, and everything that's in between those two, those two distinct elements. So of course the people who are really bright, they get the more complex jobs you know, the Navy is really good about that, but no matter what your job is, you're going to find yourself faced with a complex situation, and it's very important to follow directions because people's lives are at stake. You can actually get someone killed with some of the things that you do. Even if you're a painter or a boat driver or an electrician, no matter what you do it's gonna affect somebody some way, and you're not really familiar with exactly how it's going to affect people. So you have to really do the job that people tell you to do because you can't see all the dangers that are associated with it.</string>

<string>I first became interested in joining the military back in the day when my father used to come back from his work in his uniform from the army, and he'd tell me about all of the things that he had experienced. I grew up in the fifth sixth and seventh grade and part of the eighth grade in Germany, and although I didn't really see the military part of it, I did see some of the things that like you could have outside of the work. So I saw the nice house that you could live in, I saw the cool car that he was driving, I saw many times you know people PTing, exercising outside, PT is physical training. So I kind of got the impression of like what the military lifestyle would be like compared to all the civilian lifestyles that I saw back where I'm from, and I gotta say it was really impressive.</string>

<string>I first became interested in computer science when I was in community college. I did eight years in the navy as an active duty Electrician's Mate and I learned a lot about engineering, and I thought I was going to go to college to do electrical engineering. However, some of the classes that you learn with electrical engineering are computer science, and I went to a research internship. It wasn't an internship it was just research for UC Berkeley, and I thought I was going to do electrical engineering, but they had so many cool computer science topics and professors and little things around campus that really empowered me to kind of consider computer science as a career. So when I went back home, when I was done with the research and I went back home, I really focused on my computer science classes and I just realized, hey you know out of all the classes that I am learning, math, science, english, the computer science classes were some of the most fun, and I just thought you know, if I want to make my own business, if I was doing electrical engineering I'd have to go to radio shack, I'd have to buy resistors, I'd have to spend lots of money, I'd have to like spend lots of time. But with computer science, you have your own business right in front of you if you just open up your laptop. You can have a million dollar idea just opening your laptop and typing on some keys. So that sold me.</string>

<string>For me particularly, I chose the Navy as a career because it seemed like a very easy and straight forward step to begin a career. So at the time I was just graduated from high school, I was working at McDonalds, and you know various odd jobs, Swap Meet, a movie theater, used to sell knives, used to sell home alarm systems, I was bouncing all over the place. And I kept coming back to the thinking you know what, the military is a good way to start. I knew about their money for education, I knew about, after you do your tour you could have a really good professional career outside of the military you know. So these things were in the back of my mind. Unfortunately, I tried to join in high school and my eyesight is really bad, so they had disqualified me from joining. So I spent two years outside of high school trying to you know make my way through community college, make my way through various odd jobs, and it just wasn't for me. So like the military was a good step to, I tried again and I was accepted. So that was really step to start me off on a good career.</string>

<string>If I had to rejoin the Navy, and considering the different options that I could have, I think that being an electrician really opened up some doors for me. It actually like alllowed me to think about different things than I would have otherwise. I know about nuclear technology, I know about electricity things, voltage, current, resistors, and about power and watts. I know about lots of things that I had never even considered myself interested in before. So does that help me, in a sense, I think it does. It gives me a better perspective. Would I do it over again? So the thing that I'm lacking from doing my nuclear technology path, is I don't have a long history with computer science. So I think if I would have joined like for instance the IT field, the information technology field, then after eight years I'd be really really bright about computer science and networks and what's going on in the, on the interior of a computer. However, the problem would be that I wouldn't know the electrical portion of it. So I think I'm happy with my decision, but I would probably try to do something more computer science oriented if I had to do it again, knowing that I would do it in the future.</string>

<string>When I was a kid, I think I was more interested in like the humanities side of life. So I tried to do a little bit of piano when I was a kid. Me and my brother would go to piano lessons and I you know was a part of a black gospel choir. So I would always look at the guys that are sitting there you know dabbling on the piano really fast, and I thought you know what I can make songs like that. I had, I listened to rock and pop you know, Prince, Michael Jackson. So I thought, you know I'm listening to these songs and it gives me this feeling in my heart, so maybe I'm a musician. As it turned out, my brother didn't want to go to piano lessons anymore, so my grandmother didn't want to just take me by myself you know. So she cancelled our lessons and that was the end of that musical career. My mother was an artist, so I would always be like sketching on pads and stuff I would be drawing like animated characters X-Men and Spiderman and I was getting up there in my ability, but it also failed out. So yeah when I was young I actually wanted to do like you know like the non engineering, non STEM things, but life has a way of like throwing you in a different direction.</string>

<string>So even though I wasn't really a jock in high school, I actually had a lot of interesting activities. So I ran track and field and I was varsity material, unfortunately I sprained my ankle during my junior year so that ended my college aspirations. But I also ran cross country you know, cross country first you know running three miles at our meets and then track and field in the spring, where you run fast. I also tried my hand at other things like I guess wrestling for a day or two, basketball I tried and I didn't get accepted but also I was involved in things like SADD, Students Against Drunk Driving, Amnesty International, and a cornucopia of other things.</string>

<string>The food in the military it's, I have to say it's outstanding. Maybe not many people would agree with that because it's kind of plain and bland. So you have your cafeteria style you know, style food. You go there, I want some meat, I want some potatoes, I want some broccoli, you know. And they provide a good selection for you. They don't really season it so much because so many people come through you know, it's not like it's Applebee's or anything. They allow you season it yourself, so as long as you kind of realize that you know, then they give you big portions for little cost, or no cost if you're active duty, and technically it is healthy you know. In fact I think that they recently took salt away from the table so like you have to try to be healthy when you eat your food, and it delivers.</string>

<string>When I first joined the military I thought, okay, I'm going to be exercising all day and I'm gonna be shooting guns all night but fortunately, neither of those really came to pass. You do have some time to exercise but as far as shooting guns, it's not really something that's really popular here. Especially when you're out on deployment, which is six months in the middle of the ocean. Some people, the military police, the MPs, they have guns but it's not like they're practicing all the time you know, like it's, they practice back at shore. And when you're on shore, I basically do my job as an Electrician's Mate, it's not like I can practice. But there are opportunities to practice, there are shooting ranges that people go to, and I won my ribbons, in fact.</string>

<string>The military has a really good system for acknowledging the accomplishments that people do. So if you go out in the middle of the ocean, and you come back in, that's a tour. Then you get a little ribbon right here. You can't see on this uniform but on other uniforms you wear, your dress blues, your dress whites, other like nice uniforms that you wear, you can have like little emblems. They go three by three by three and you can get them for various things. If you shoot a gun really well, then you can get an expert ribbon. If you do something really really productive for the ship that you're on, then you can get like the Navy achievement medal let's say. Or if you go to a specific place in the middle, in the world, and you fight a certain war, then you can get another ribbon. So as you, the longer that you're in, you start acquiring these ribbons any you can kind of see who's been, number one in the longest time, and number two, who's had the most success in their job by the amount of ribbons that they have. You can really see lots of admirals with like really big huge stacks of ribbons.</string>

<string>Some of the ribbons that I've received include the pistol ribbon and the rifle ribbon, both experts. I received the sea service deployment ribbon, which means that I went on a ship. Some people in the Navy don't do that, so the ones who do, they get that. I've also received a expeditionary ribbon for my ship because we did a really good job out there when we were doing training, and I was a big part of that. I've won a few other ones, in total I've won about thirteen more.</string>

<string>We definitely don't get to swim in the middle of the ocean. So, I actually did get to swim in the ocean but that's not very common. One day it was like really hot, we had been out to sea for a month, two months, people were getting antsy. So we had a swim call. So what happened was our aircraft carrier was, it came to a full stop, we had navy seals in boats around the water with guns to shoot sharks, and we could jump from the elevator, the aircraft elevator, which is really far far up. It's about like a five or six second drop, once you drop over the edge. It's kinda like a diving board. So you jump over the edge, you go down in this beautiful bath water, and keep going then it gets really cold, then you come back up and it's warm again, and then you're supposed to swim to the back of the ship. So it's about another maybe, minute more to go to the back, and then you have to get out. So it's not like you can like hang out there you know swim, throw a frisbee around, like play volleyball or anything. It's like you jump across, go down in the water, and then you come out, and you swim to the back. You can do that many times you know, but I did it once just to see. I think I actually did it twice. It was kinda fun, I can barely swim so that's good enough for me.</string>

<string>You don't have to be the best swimmer to join the military. That's a common question, it's like what, you're in the military and you can't swim? It's like yeah, so I learned to swim while I was in the navy, but when I first started I could barely doggy paddle. So the requirements for boot camp are you have to jump into some water and you can't hold on to anything, you have to be afloat for two minutes, and then you come back up. So if you don't know how to do that then there are some, there's a little bit of practice that you can do, and so basically everybody passes. If you definitely can't pass, then they have like specific training for you, but most of the time that's not a problem to pass, to just do two minutes.</string>

<string>Deployment is what it's called when a Navy vessel goes to an extended deployment to fight a war or do some training. So my ship, the USS John C. Stennis, we actually went from our home port in San Diego and we went to the Middle East and swam in the ocean there. We didn't swim we rode on the boat right, but around the Arabian gulf, around the surrounding islands, maybe around Singapore. And just in that general area while the war was going on and we stayed there for six months, and then we come back home to San Diego. So once you're home to your home for then you do go out on the ship sometimes, but you don't go out for that long, and you don't go out that far. But deployment is, that's when your family comes, you know you say goodbye to your significant other, you know you tap your kids on the shoulder and say you know be good to your dad or your mom, you pack your bags up and then it's a big farewell ceremony you know and then everybody there waits for you to come back six or seven or eight months later.</string>

<string>Something that a lot of people don't really realize about computer science is just how easy it is. Yes it can be very difficult. You sometimes have to figure out algorithms you have to figure out the best way to put the light that comes on the screen based on the moving of the characters, and you have to like, you have to understand that the computer is like calculating thousands of things per second you know, actually millions of things per second. So you have to like tweak and optimize the things that are, that you tell the computer to do to make it. So all that's very very difficult. However, some of computer science is really really easy I know that some people who had never done computers at all, can you know study for a week or two, and then put things on the computer like web design or something. So then based on what they learn over the next like a few weeks they can actually make a career out of that, and that's computer science as well. So it ranges from very easy to very hard, and lot of people think aw, computer science is so difficult. Eh, it's as difficult as you can make it. It's as difficult as how hard you're willing to try.</string>

<string>The person who gave me the best advice about my career would probably be the people that are really close to me when I was going through each of the jobs that I was going to be. So for instance it would probably be the people beside me when I was going to school. That would be like maybe the teachers or the instructors. Once I got to my first ship it would probably be the chiefs and the senior chiefs who kind of gave me at least some kind of motivation to be like them. They didn't really teach me, well I didn't get the advice from the things that they showed me, but it's more like the way to be a chief, the way to be in the military you know. That part is like more valuable for me wanting to stay in the military and keep in the military rather than like this is how you charge an electrical device or something like that so. After I got out of the military, I actually was looking more towards the people not even in the military. So I'm in USC's, University of Southern California's Institute for Creative Technologies, and I've gotten a lot of really good advice for my military career from people who aren't even in the military themselves. Just because they have, they understand what it takes to be in the military and where the future of the military lies. And kind of without that advice, I guess I wouldn't think about the military in a civilian type of way. So I'm really thankful to all three of them, the instructors, the chiefs and senior chiefs, and the civilians who had an influence on my life and my military career.</string>

<string>The way that you can be the best at your job, the way that you can work smarter is open up the books. I have to say you know, I wasn't really a STEM engineering type myself you know. I think everybody had an upper hand on me when I first joined, but the difference between me and a lot of other guys and girls while we were going through, the reason that I can really rise through the ranks is because I was opening the books all the time. There's these things called watches that you stand, where you kinda sit in a chair and you like watch gauges and make sure that you know nothing's like exploding. But that's kinda like free time you know, so you can't like read comic books, you can't watch a movie there, so with that spare time they actually tell you, open up the books you know. Open up and keep your training going yourself. So that's what I used to do, that's what I did, and it's, I found out that month after month you know, year after year, my knowledge was steadily improving, and I think it has a lot to do with the fact that I was reading a lot during my watches.</string>

<string>If you wanted to get in good with your bosses or your chiefs or your senior chiefs, or if you're an officer, the superior officers, number one it would be good to have a good personality. Now everybody hates the fact that you know jobs like the military, pretty much any job is political. But that is, nobody likes to work around people that they don't like. If you're an introvert, it would be good for your career if you can kinda like express yourself a little bit you know, kind of be friends with the person that's working beside you. You know you might watch a lot of military movies and see guns, see people fighting and shooting, and you know like eventually you can see that they become a band of brothers you know even if they're girls but band of brothers right, that's the saying. And if you can try to you know live up to that movie stereotype, then that would work very well with your superiors because the key word, the only word that really matters for the military is teamwork, and the more that you can show that you're a team, the more that you can like relate to your peers, then that would look really good with your superiors.</string>

<string>Throughout your whole military career you basically are going to be taken care of regardless of whether you're an E1 or whether you're an admiral. They provide your housing in a different type of way, they provide your food in a different type of way. So this is what I mean. When you just join the military, they know you don't make that much cash, so what they do is they, some people they have to make them stay on the ship you know to sleep. After you make it to around like E5, the second class petty officer level, then they start giving you this thing called B.A.H. It's basic allowance for housing. They say if you choose to, you're allowed to find an apartment out in the world and we'll give you money for it. In other locations if you're second class petty officer, then they might allow you to stay in the houses on base. Especially if you are staying in a foreign country then you know you're probably staying on base. As you get a lot higher in rank, like for instance if you're a chief, senior chief, or master chief or if you're an officer, then they probably give you lots of cash and they probably allow you to find a much bigger house. Because chances are, those people probably have much bigger families.</string>

<string>I've stayed in a lot of different places since I've been in the military. One was Charleston, South Carolina, then I moved up to Albany, New York, then I moved down across the country to San Diego. Then I moved up from there to Birmington, Washington. Now they all had a different flavor. One was a really good climate with lots of people, that's San Diego. Birmington was kind of more to the countryside, but you can have bigger houses and you can do hiking and skiing you know  but it got pretty cold and rainy. New York was close to New York City, but Albany is lots of green trees everywhere you know. The houses are really big, but nothing was around that area. There was no building more than like five stories high you know, that's Albany for you so it's a very quiet town. And in Charleston, South Carolina I guess it's kind of like old style, and more south. So out of all those places that I've been since I've been in the military, I'm a California person, so I gotta do the San Diego thing.</string>

<string>So the Navy did provide some opportunities for me to live overseas, I just never like really capitalized on it. So my job is a nuclear technician, and unfortunately we're only allowed to stay domestic. However they do give you opportunities to change your roles. Not your job, I'll always be an Electrician's Mate, but your roles throughout your career, they understand that they can't just put somebody on a boat you know for twenty years and think that he'll retire. He'll go crazy, right? So after your tour of maybe four years, then they provide you some opportunities to do different type of work. So they can send you to a shore command, let's say in San Diego where you can kinda like just chill at one of the facilities there, no boats, just a nine to five job. They also, they offered me to go to Italy to work on a sub tender, which is kinda like being on a little boat, you get lots of port calls and stuff so that's one opportunity to go overseas, but if you do like four years on an aircraft carrier, then a couple more years on another boat, that's a lot of sea time. So that was one opportunity for me. They also had another aircraft carrier that was stationed in Japan, it was called the USS Kitty Hawk. However it like, that's where I was going to go, I was in camp like let you know four places in America or send me to Japan? I'm going to Japan, that's where I'm going to go you know, but nah unfortunately we weren't able to go on that. No nukes go on the Kitty Hawk anymore, so we were just on domestic soil for that whole time, dangit.</string>

<string>So everybody joins the military as an E1 in boot camp, regardless of your rate. So once you join the military you get some kinds of incentives to join, so being a nuclear technician we're allowed to become E3s immediately. But in boot camp everyone's E1. So as soon as boot camp ended, then I was promoted to a fireman, which is the the engineering side of E3 right, and I did that for school, I was in school for six months, and by the time I graduated that school after six months, I was promoted to a first class petty officer, which is E4. Then I was, I went to nuclear power school, and then prototype training. They're both six months and six months, then I went to my first ship. Now when I finally got to my first ship, that's when I had been in for two years and also because of my rate, nuclear technician, they offered us to automatically be promoted to second class petty officer, that's E5. And that's what I did, they offered us some cash, I got forty thousand dollars in cash, and it was tax free because we were fighting the war and I got automatically promoted to E5. So up until that time that for the first two years I'd always been automatically promoted either by school or just by joining, or just by signing a contract for an additional two years. That automatic promotion to E5 was because I extended my contract from six years to eight years. After that time, after that two years, then I was, I got promoted four years later to E6. So I was promoted E5 in 2002 promoted E6 in 2006, and then I guess I spent two more years in the military, and then I got out after eight years as an E6, which is first class petty officer. Then I made chief, which is what I am now, E7 in 2010, so that's four more years after. So again the time line is I joined boot camp, that's E1, after boot camp, which is about three months, then I was E3, a year and a half later I was, I'm sorry six months later I was E4, at my two year point I was an E5, and then four years later I was an E6, and four more years after that I was E7, chief.</string>

<string>So my salary obviously it changes every time I get promoted. It also changes every two years, so the longer that you're in the military you get a little bit more money. So right now I'm a chief and it depends on which, which city you live in, which is gonna dictate your BAH your basic allowance for housing, but everybody makes the same basic pay. So my basic pay right now is $4,500 per month, if I were to be active active duty service, and I also get another couple thousand dollars are for my BAH which is the money that they give you for housing. So all in all it's about $75,000 per year with 16 years in. A person who just barely comes in, he's not going to get, he or she is not going to get that BAH. They will probably just be living on a ship or something like that, and as far as the basic pay, it's probably just a couple thousand dollars maybe $3,000 when you talk about outside of boot camp. So it's about $35,000 to start. So one year in the military you're at $35,000, 16 years you're at $75,000, and that's from an E1 to a chief, it ramps accordingly.</string>

<string>The military is divided up into two parts. You have the enlisted and you also have the officers. Officers are people who have been to college, who have a degree, and who have been awarded a commission, which means their job is to take care of people, their job is to have a command underneath them. So the people that they hire are called the enlisted people. Enlisted people just have to have a college degree or, sorry not college degree, a high school degree or a GED, and then you're able to join the military. You're sent to a vocational school, it's called A school, and from that time then you are actually like the performer, the technical person, the person who drives the ship, or the person who makes the pump, or the person who checks the voltage. So the officers are the people in charge, the enlisted people are the ones who do it. So the enlisted people have a ranking from E1 to E9. An E1 is, it could be, well there are three types. There are the people that deal with aircraft things, people who deal with ship type things, and then people who are engineers. So the engineers are called firemen, the ship type people are called seamen, and the airforce jet type people are called airmen. So there's airmen recruit, then you go airman apprentice, and then you have just a regular airman for E3. That's E1, E2, and E3. After that, E4, E5, and E6, those are called petty officers, so E4 is called third class petty officer, E5 is second class petty officer, and E6 is first class petty officer. And then you have three more which is are chiefs. So I'm an E7 which is a chief and they have a slightly different emblem for their uniform. They're all gold and you can see that this is an anchor. So if you just have this, that's a chief, if you have a star right here that's a E8, that's a senior chief. If you have two stars right here, that's a master chief. So again, E1, E2, E3, petty officer, third class, second class, and first class, and then chiefs: chief, senior chief, master chief. Officers they're their own beasts.</string>

<string>The officers have a step system just like the enlisted sailors do. So for the officers you have O1 which is Ensign, you've probably heard those from the movies and things like that. For O2 that's Lieutenant JG, Lieutenant Junior Grade. For O3 there's a Lieutenant. O4 is Lieutenant Commander. O5 is Commander.O6 is a Captain and Captains are the ones, they're basically really really high in their officer community. They're the people that command the ship, command the aircraft carrier, those are Captains. After that, then you have people who have been Captains for a long time and they're super senior people that you see on TV, those are the Admirals. So you have Rear Admiral Lower Half, Upper Half, Vice Admiral and Admiral. That's O7, O8, O9, and O10.</string>

<string>For me the living quarters in the navy are outstanding. A lot of people that join they think well it is my first place that I've been staying you know. So like no matter what it is, they'll have a lot of complaints but I realize, I grew up in Flint, Michigan you know, so the fact that they gave me a nice clean bed with clean furniture and a desk right there you know, and that's all they give, and a closet you know. It looks like a tiny little hotel you know, like kind of a cheap hotel, but for me that's you know and the fact that it's free like really blew my mind away. So the other place that you can stay at, for instance the Navy Gateway Inn, or the Navy lodge, they're some of the highest quality hotels that you can find. For instance I was in Hawaii a couple of years ago and I stayed at like this expensive like $300 hotel, and it was nice you know there's a bed, king size bed and you know. But then you stay at the Navy lodge down the street and it's like a huge room with nice fans and there's like, the bedroom has its own door. The bathroom is like you can swim in it, you know you go outside and there's like three couches and there's like TVs for every room, it's crazy. It has its own separate kitchen so like they realize that you know the military people that are traveling across the country, they need a nice place to stay. So it's some of the best places that I've stayed at. Now the place that the military provides for the sailors, it's very quaint. But those places that you go on for vacation, or the places that the Admirals stay at, or the places that you have to pay for that's not, that isn't for official work, they're some of the nicest in America.</string>

<string>Some of the crimes that people commit when they're in the military almost always deal with drinking. So for instance, let's say there's a robbery, chances are there's alcohol involved. If there's a crash, there's probably alcohol involved. If there is a fight, chances are there is alcohol involved. So I say that the common crime is drinking alcohol, but that's not a crime in itself. The other things are kind of collateral damage, so yeah if you're on a ship for a year, then you will see that somebody has robbed, one person on the ship has robbed somebody out there in the world, you will hear about four fights, five fights that got people demoted, and you will hear about three drunk driving's. Maybe there was no crash but they just got caught for it. So those are the common crimes that I see committed.</string>

<string>You can receive a cash bonus if you enlist depending on the needs of the Navy. So if we're about to fight a war, or if we're in the middle of a war, then you can expect that they're trying to increase the size of the military, and for that then they provide a bonus. If there, if it's kinda peacetime or if they're downsizing the Navy, then obviously they offer less. So it's a size shaping tool that the Navy has to get people to come in and leave. With that said, in most cases for their advanced jobs, they almost always have some kind of incentive. It ranges in the amount, but it's there nonetheless. So the amount that I received, they gave me the choice, they said I could have $12,000 in cash, you know minus taxes, or you could have a really big educational bonus. It was $50,000. So I knew I was going to go to college and I wanted to make sure that I didn't you know like spend the money early so I said give me the educational bonus at the end. A lot of people that I knew like I guess the first year I was in you know, people had new cars they put down payments on like nice musical equipment and stuff like that. So some other jobs that you could have that provide bonuses, are obviously a lot of the STEM jobs. So there's Electrician's Mate, that's not inside the nuclear field but just regular electricians. There's Fire Controlmen FC's. So those are the ones who fix like all of the, from the engineering plants up. That mean's like the top part of the ship, not dealing with the nuclear side, just from engineering and up you know. They have to be pretty bright too, so they get bonuses. And Cryptological Technicians that learn languages, they're the spies, the ones who like listen, try to find out what foreign people are are up to, they get cash bonuses. So jobs like that, they're the ones who tend to get the biggest bonuses.</string>

<string>The Navy has some of the best retirement packages in the United States, that's hands down. After you've been in for twenty years, then you're allowed to have retirement. At the end of your twenty years, you can either on say I would like to retire, or you can stay in up to thirty years. So every year that you're in you get to have two and a half percent longer than twenty years. At twenty years you get half of your basic pay, so this is what I mean. The Navy gives you lots of money while you're in based on certain things. Sixty percent of what you make is your basic pay, then you get a little more for sustenance, which is just the basic things that you need for your home. You also get a little bit more for if you're on a submarine or not. Also you get some more basic allowance for housing for your housing costs. But sixty percent of that is your basic pay. So the navy gives you half that at a twenty year point. I'm a chief, I make $4,500 per month so they give me half of that at twenty years. If I chose to stay in longer then the add on another two and a half percent, two and a half percent, two and a half percent. Depending on what I retire as, it can be up to thirty years, so at thirty years that'll be seventy five percent of your basic pay. Now because I'm a chief I make $4,500 per month, but they basically take your highest three months of earning, and that's the cost that that they provide you for your retirement.</string>

<string>Whenever you want to join the military, then you have to go to one of the different service branches. So there's one in every major city, sometimes there are two. So you go into whichever one you feel you might most be fitted for. I actually tried to join the airforce at first, but I ended up in the Navy. There's gonna be somebody behind a desk that's going to you know say can you please have a seat, so why do you want to join? What kinds of things interest you? They'll ask lots of questions about like how did in high school, what your interests are, and see if you're a good fit. They're also trying to see if you have a kind of criminal background and if you seem maybe uncommitted, they'll probably push you to the side. But they want to give everybody a chance so after you have your initial conversation with him, he'll ask you to take a practice test. It could be right there at that same time. So the recruiter will guide you to another room and the test is kind of like a little mini scholostic achievement test, a mini SAT. It has a little bit of physics there, math there, a little bit of english there, just general things. So you don't have to be scared of the test, it's not a pass or fail. It's more like what types of jobs you can have. So you take the test and where you score he'll say he has a list of maybe sixty, seventy jobs these are the ones that you qualify for. If you don't qualify for the job you want, then you're allowed to practice a little bit more. He'll give you some resources that you can use to study. But by that time if you are decided on the type of job that you want, that you're willing to do, then he will take you to, he or she will take you to this thing called MEPS, it's military entrance processing place that you can go to with lots of other people who are interested in joining the military to take the real test. The real test is nice and quiet, it's a lot longer, it's very comprehensive, and that's when they can offer you the real job. They'll probably serve you some breakfast in the morning it's an all day thing, and assuming that you pass the test on that same day, they can also have, get you through medical at that time which means that they'll check your eyes, check your dental, make sure that you're physically fit to go through it, and maybe the entire recruiting process could take maybe a week, maybe even a couple of days I have heard. But for me it took several months. They have you in this thing called delayed entrance processing where you do your test, you figure out the job that you want and maybe you don't have to join the service until a good time for them, which could be like a year later or maybe after your high school, after you graduate high school or after you finish your job or something like that.</string>

<string>After you get done with your initial entrance processing for the military, then you're onward to boot camp. Boot camp is about three months, and they train you on simple things, tying knots, communicating with other people, how to do drill formations, things that you see in Full Metal Jacket. If you want to watch the first half of that movie then you understand what boot camp tries to be like. After that, then you're onward to your first vocational school, which is called A school. It ranges in size my school was six months, but it could be as short as two weeks. In general it's a couple months. After that time, then you're supposed to go off to your ship unless your in an advanced program like I was, in which case you'll go on to another school. My next school was a nuclear power school for another six months, and then after that I had prototype training, which means that they sent me to a real prototype to train on the real thing with people watching me, of course and that was six months. Then I went to my ship.</string>

<string>Boot camp is the initial training that all military members go through. So you go to this place near the Chicago area and they put you in a division, it's about maybe thirty people or so. It's very very strict there. Everybody's in bunk beds and be teach you how to make your bed, but it's in a very special way. All the creases have to be aligned perfectly, all of the sheets have to be super clean and facing the same way. So it's not, when they teach you to make this bed, it's not the fact that they want you to make a bed this way, it's the fact that they're looking to make sure that you can follow directions. They give you a list of steps and they make sure that number one you don't talk back to them, number two that you do it at the time that it is supposed to be done, at six o'clock or at five o'clock in the morning, with you standing outside of your bed with it already been made. They make sure that there's nothing on the bed or inside the bed, or that it's all made the same way. So there's a lot that goes into making this bed. So I'm mentioning this bed part because everything about boot camp is the exact same way, from the books that you train on, to the knots that you're making, to the way that you do your drills. It's not that they're trying to teach you these things, they are but they're actually filtering out who has no problem with following directions and who needs a little bit more time to train in these things, and for some reason like let's say you come from a bad neighborhood, you don't like being talked to and yelled at, those are people that would have problems if they go out into the real service. So they take those people to the side, maybe they're in boot camp for a little bit longer or maybe they actually get kicked out of boot camp. But by the time you get done with your three months or four months of boot camp, you should have a good idea of what discipline is like, and how to follow directions from the simplest of tasks to the more complex tasks.</string>

<string>Computer science is a really broad field so whether you like to work with your hands or whether you like to work with your mind, there's something for everybody. So for the people that like to get into the machine, you can do hardware, computer hardware, and that's when you open it up and you look at the motherboard, you check the voltage of it if you're going to be like fixing it. Or gonna try to figure out like how to design everything in a nice ten inch by eight inch little square you know, like so that it all fits. So how to put the USB in a certain spot. If you want to deal with the way that the computer looks, that could be like web design. There's this thing called Cascading Style Sheets where they make regular text like "my name is Clint" and you can make it like big, blue, bright, colorful and you know make it dancing all along the screen. So it doesn't take that much computer science knowledge to do web design, that's what's it's a really popular field for people who are just getting into computer science. Now if you're mathematically inclined then you can start thinking about the way that the letters dance on the screen, or the way that Marla jumps, or the way Marla being a video game character, or the way that an operating system like does the process that it's doing behind the scenes. So like let's say there's a little bit of math that goes into it, nothing too complex we're not dealing with calculus here but we are dealing with very, it's hard to describe, and when you think of computer scientist being smart then your thinking about programmers. Those are the ones who I'm talking about. Programmers are the ones who open up an application and they start typing inside and they tell the computer, computer listen to me can you please open this application and make this jump, and make this, when I press the enter key make sure that the program closes and another program opens, and this is the first word that shows up on the screen when I do this. So programmer are, they actually program the computer to work. Another thing is graphics, where this is the way that the light reflects from the computer. So you kind of think about the way that TV screens have looked throughout the ages. First they came in black and white, then they had a little bit of color, and then they had a lot more pizzazz and they're very very sharp now. TVs now, they look like real life people as opposed to like the blurry ones from before. So the people in graphics, they're the ones who constantly make sure that the programmers do the right code so that the computer knows how to do it really fast, and so that the light that reflects doesn't make the computer slow and that it looks really clear to the viewer. So those are several of the many computer science jobs that are available ranging from the really hardware based to the graphics to the programming to graphics, there are many more.</string>

<string>If you're thinking about becoming a computer scientist yourself, I would have to say that the first thing you should do is probably look online to find out about what different types of jobs there are and what it is they do. With a little bit of experience, with a little bit of browsing around on Google, you can kinda get an idea about it. But it they don't really tell you exactly what they do, so the next person would be probably someone in the field obviously. If you can find a NASA computer scientist then go for it you know, but any university student who's your junior, senior level, they have your basic programming skills they have your basic idea of what computer theory involves. So just asking a couple questions you know, whether it's been hard for them, whether anybody with a with a normal high school degree can kinda do this work, whether the job that they're doing is really really complex. It ranges so they might not be the guide you the best, but they can give you an idea of like kind of where you fit in, and whether it's a career that you want to try yourself.</string>

<string>Our uniform ranges a lot from clothes that you wear everyday like this, these are camouflage, this is a camouflage shirt that I'm wearing and matching pants and really hard, rock hard boots to make sure that you don't stub your toe. And you can go on up to your dress blues which is like when you're going to a very special occasion, maybe some kind of ceremony, that you need to look very presentable, you wouldn't work in your dress blues. So other uniforms that we wear, I wear khakis. Chiefs which is E7, E8, E9 and officers they've wear things call khakis, which is like a nice pressed uniform, it's brown with white instead of this blue, and matching pants. You can work in them but generally those are people that kind of oversee people working. The workers on the other hand they can wear these things called coveralls, which is it brings you back to your five year old days, which is like a one piece body suit. You can put one leg in, one leg in, put your arms in, then zip it all the way up and coveralls look like the things that people that change oil, their clothes, they wear. So if you think about someone changing your oil, he gets on that like sliding machine thing, then goes up under the car. That whole entire uniform is, that's what coveralls look like, and they're all blue, except they're for the Navy.</string>

<string>Since you're going to be in the military, you have to make sure that you're on time for things. So if you show up late, then people will look at you "Hey you know come on time next time." You show up late twice then you get scolded, come late three times then chances are you could be sitting in front of a chief having him and other chiefs like come down on you, and you do it four times then you probably get written up with the counseling check, which means that like I said "Hey like I told this guy it's a cause for being fired from the military so make sure that you don't do it again." So yeah if that's not  your deal you know, you show up whenever you want, then you should erase that from your vocabulary because the Navy's pretty tight with their schedules.</string>

<string>The field that you want to work in is specifically guided by how well you did on the test. So basically you rate. So it's very important to kind of, if you do want to work in a demanding field, to try to score as high as you can. If you don't get the job you want when you tried first tried, then before you join try to you know bump it up a little bit you know, to try to get that job. So once you're in the military, then there's gonna be a big range of jobs that you can do. You can work in the library, you can work you know with electrical components, at least for me as an Electrician's Mate I had a wide range of things that I could do. So if you're trying to ask which job I can do, which job can I apply for, a lot of it's kind of political. A lot of it's well you know like we've known him for a while, he's been on the ship for a long time so like he has a choice. Since you just come to the ship then like this is the only job that we have for you you know. You could be painting this deck or scrubbing this floor, right that's the job that we have for you. But if you've been in for a lot longer then you have a little bit of leeway in asking for jobs, and again you know within your rate, it depends on how high you score. So for instance there's going to be people who will be providing work to other people who are going to be writing it down, writing their job descriptions down and providing it. We need those people to be some of the brightest so if you don't have a good work history, then you might not be able to apply for for that job. So number one try to score as high as possible, and number two try to learn on the job as much as possible, and that's how you can get the best job that you want.</string>

<string>The most difficult part of training I gotta say, it's probably the material, at least for nuclear technology. I wasn't a very good student. I got good grades but it was really difficult for me to learn the material myself. Like for instance one of the things that we learned is what grounds are you know, and it took me so long to figure out what a ground is, like ground they say it's the earth you know. Like what do you mean by that? Eventually you find out that ground means that that's a plane of neutral electricity so that you can have high voltage and low voltage and ground means, and there is a way to learn it but it just took me a really long time to learn it because I wasn't really technical. So that's a really simple thing I learned that you know like I had to catch up on, but they're a lot more complex things you know, like when you learned about multiplexes, you're learning about the way that the voltage regulator really works on the inside you know. Those can be really difficult so it's a wrap your head around, but eventually with enough opening the pages and putting your eyes on it over and over and over, it become simple. Everything becomes simple with lots of practice.</string>

<string>The most difficult part about learning what computer science is and getting into it is getting past the first block that you have, that I had thinking that it's difficult, thinking that computer science is something for other people. Think about, thinking that it's for smart people, for math people, or for people that got 4.0's in school you know. It's not you know, you have a wide range just like any other job out there, so once you get past that then you have to realize the book that you're reading maybe is written by computer scientists themselves you know. So there could be a time when you have to close the book and go you know prep yourself a little bit more you know, find some material online, find some easy to understand topics that can kind of prep you to go back to the more difficult book that you're reading in your hands. So yeah the material can be hard sometimes, the projects that we have can be you know really demanding, but with enough time you know, they say seven years you become an expert. Ten thousand hours you become an expert so you put in that time, then you will learn computer science.</string>

<string>The Navy for me has just been one big university Greek life style, it's just a whole bunch of you know young kids getting together, drinking on the weekends, kind of partying on Sundays. Coming in you know like ready to work on Monday through Thursday but you know the weekend is theirs and even after the hour is done you know, even after the working time is done, they're still there's lots of video games going on, there's lots of card playing that that goes on you know during the work day. There looking at each other and making jokes you know doing you know a lot of like childish things all the time. So they keep it fun sometimes and just like with all young kids you know, like there's lots of arguments, lots of, they make enemies just like any other. It's basically high school all over again in some cases with more discipline for the things that require the discipline.</string>

<string>The salaries that the military people make, they kind of range in how they compare to what civilians make. So officers kind of make slightly less than their civilian counterparts. That is, an officer you can take any officer and put them in a civilian job and they'd probably be making about ten to twenty thousand dollars more in the civilian sector. However, there's a lot of job security that comes with being in the military. You're not going to get fired unless you like really messed up. Now that you're protecting our country and you're doing it in an efficient manner you know, you're doing it effectively. So there's a cost with that and the cost is our salary, so there is a saying that the military don't make that much, and it can be true in some cases. However if you do it with pride and you enjoy you work and you think about the excellent retirement benefits that they give you, you'll see that maybe by the end of your twenty years you know, you didn't make that much less, however you have a much more fulfilling career. For enlisted people, it could very very similar or even better than your civic counterparts, at least for nuclear technicians we made a lot less than our civilian counterparts.  In fact many people get out after six or eight years and then they start working and they could easily make double what they're making. That is they leave as a first class petty officer making about sixty five or seventy thousand dollars a year and then they can make double that working as Homer Simpson you know down at the nuclear power plant. Other things like maybe a cook or Boatsmen's Mate or let's say a weapons handler, they can find very very similar jobs out there so then they have the choice. Do I stay in the military that I've already put in like maybe six or seven years, or I do I become a civilian, maybe have to start all over, but start at a higher rate and higher job position than I would have if I would just join from high school. So many people in that position they probably stay in military because the retirements, and the amount of time they put in as far as their pride you know. All of that makes them stay in so.</string>

<string>Everyone in the military that is on a ship will be deployed at sometime. So our schedule is we do one and a half years on the shore, and then we do six months at sea. We do that twice and after that time, after that four year period, then you're scheduled to go work on a short command, and that should be anywhere from two to three years. So it depends on whether we're at war or not, whether the up tempo is really high or not, whether the ship that you're on has been out to sea a lot, but that's generally, the two year, the two year ship shore schedule is generally what it is.</string>

<string>When you're on your ship you have a lot of opportunities available to you. Now I won't lie, the bigger the ship you're on the more opportunities that are available. So you have a really small ship let's say a destroyer, that's not small but like the destroyer is I guess a ship that has maybe a couple thousand people on it. It's kind of like a high school you could say, the size of a high school. And there aren't that many things to do. I've never been on a destroyer but I just know from my experience with the aircraft carrier. It has to have less than what I had and at least for an aircraft carrier which has five thousand people usually. When we're on deployment we have, it goes up to eight thousand people when you add all the people that come in with airplanes, and the people that take care of the airplanes, and the extra officers and enlisted people. Eight thousand people is the size of a small city. So on an aircraft carrier we have our own post office, we have our own little recreation center. We have a couple of places for fitness, but in general it is a war craft vessel. Therefore there aren't that many, there are limited places that you can do, that you can have on the ship that cater to entertainment. So people find their own entertainment. So for me, my entertainment on the ship was I'd watch movies all the time. So everybody has their own little laptop or their DVD player, you can rent movies from the little recreation center that's there. They had bands in little hidden spots of the ship. So there would be drums and guitars and you know like even keyboards all hidden, but that did they make space and you know they play as loud as they want. Obviously the fitness centers are there, and you can see card playing all over the place. Whenever there is a rack, a living quarter, then there's this little table outside you know like three or four of them. With couches to watch TV to watch movies and to play cards right there, so that's how we spent our deployments.</string>

<string>I chose to be a part of the navy yes because I wanted to further my career and have you know a good salary, all the benefits, but I also feel that you have to serve your country at sometime in your life. Now I know that sounds cliche, but that's the way that I feel. I came from a really military family. My uncle was in the military, my dad was in the military, my brother was in the military, and me too, and although yes I could of just been a civilian, like I was on that path. It felt like, at least for me in particular, it felt like something would've been missing from my life, something I can't be on my death bed and say that I never protected my country the way that I saw my family protect it. So it was a calling for me. Why would other people join the military especially if you don't have military people in your family, you have to think. Well first you have to trust your politicians. You'd have to think that they're going to war and they're defending America for good reason. So the wars that we fight we hope will bring stability to the world. You might see on TV that you know children are bloodied and people are you know like running for their lives, running from terrorism, running from lots of different things, you know you've seen the news. So if you wanna be a part of bringing that to an end, then military is one way that you can at least try. Also defending the nation, now we've been safe for a long time. Yes we had 9-11 and yes there are domestic terrorists but compared to other countries in the world, you might realize that America is a pretty safe place to live. When you're considering foreign powers trying to come in and influence us. So we have that strong military to thank for that. So if you want to be a part of that team you know, and have the stamp of veteran for your character for as long as you live then the Navy would be a good spot to start.</string>

<string>When you think about your future career computer science could be one of the funnest things that you can do. I know for me I took some english classes in college and math classes and lots of other classes. And the one that I actually wanted to do homework for, the one that I finished the homework assignment and I wanted to keep working on it afterwards despite what the you know, despite my grade, despite you know like whether I did good on it or not, and despite whether I'd be graded on it or not, it was computer science. That's one of the only ones that affected me like that. If you want to maybe make your own business with your laptop based on things that are in your mind, things that you're coming up with on the fly, then computer science would be a good choice. If you want to be in the music industry and work on like different sounds and processes and, I guess computer science has a has a big deal with music as well and movies as well. My job for my major at University of Southern California is game development, and as it turns out, games are actually more, turn out more profit than movies nowadays. So if you like games, then computer science could be the way to go as well.</string>

<string>The impact that you can have as an engineer and particularly computer scientists are amazing. So when I was in the military I did a job and I noticed that whatever I did on January 1st wouldn't really be recognized on December 31st, it's because I'm doing the same job. That's fine for a lot of people, but for me I chose to try something different than the military job that I was doing because I wanted my job to be persistent. So this is what I mean. Right now I'm with the University of Southern California's Institute for Creative Technology making this video. This video could be seen by thousands, hundreds of thousands, hopefully millions of other Navy people. I could affect those lives. These are things that are going to be happening you know five years from now, ten years from now. So I can actually affect my world. Many engineering communities are like that. If you're making a robot right, if you make that robot on January 1st, hopefully December 31st you're shipping that robot, and that robot will go to Afghanistan and find a bomb you know. If you're an electrical technician, maybe you're making some kind of new component for a car and later on that car is gonna be faster because of the component you made. So for a lot of engineering jobs you work and then you create a component, you create a product, and then you can see that product in action, and that's one of the biggest benefits of being in a STEM field.</string>

<string>There's a lot of socialization that happens outside of the military for military members. This is what I mean. So you're with these guys from the morning until you know work ends at like four, five o'clock and you would think that hey you know what, in a civilian job you take off you know do my own thing. But it turns out that when these are your friends you know, these are the guys that you're joking around with, these are the guys that you've been on deployment with and you have to see them everyday. You become very much like family you know, very much like brothers and sisters. So as soon as work ends, these same guys are going to be going to the local bar and drinking and chatting and maybe then going to somebody's house and playing video games and stuff so it's very very close here.</string>

<string>The gender mix is very male oriented, just like any engineering job. any engineering academic field, they sway over to to men. So the Navy's pretty good about that, the Air Force is the best I think, they're you know getting close to like sixty forty percent maybe even higher, male to female ratio. I think the Navy is a little bit lower it's from what I understand, maybe my aircraft carrier was one quarter female, at least that's kind of what I saw, and that's about what it was. But it could be lower, maybe twenty percent is probably what I'm guessing. The engineering field of the Navy is, on submarines depends you know which ones you're going on. If it's a fast attack submarine I think they just barely started just a couple years ago started allowing females on, and if you're on a ballistic submarine, which means they shoot nukes off, nuclear weapons off, then they don't have females on there at all.</string>

<string>The Navy is pretty diverse. I think it also depends on which location you're in, because people tend to go back to where they come from. So let's say South Carolina which is very white then it probably has a higher percentage of white people there. In California, which is very very diverse, then you have a lot more of a diverse mix there you know so, but despite that wherever there's a military town, it's much more diverse than the outlying area by far so you don't really have to worry about being in a select group in the military, it's it's all over the place. So I think from what I saw, there's, percentages would probably go maybe five percent Filipino, maybe ten percent black, maybe fifty percent white, twenty percent Asian, and then the rest is a kind of mix. But like I said it really depends on what your rate is. For maybe the higher level rates, it tends to be mostly white and Asian, and it also depends on which city you live in, for there's people that want to come back to live around their family.</string>

<string>There are a lot of reasons that people leave the military. The military has a lot of great reasons to stay, the retirement benefits, the job security, serve the country. However, I think especially when people want to make a higher salary, and they find a good job outside and they want to just try to do something else, then that can be a good motivating factor. The military can be very dangerous, especially like for the people that send the planes off. If you do that you know every single year, month after month, day after day, then that could affect your hearing. You can be in many dangerous situations and some people just don't want to do that type of job anymore, that can be risky. Another reason that people leave the military is because they want to see their family grow. When you're on deployment that's a good six months that you don't see your daughter grow. You don't see your son grow, you're not with your wife, you're not with your husband. So after a few of those deployments, you kinda start to miss that, you actually want to see when your spouse has their kid you know. If your wife is pregnant you want to actually see it be born. And I know a lot of people who weren't there for that, so that's the third reason that I see a lot of people leave the military.</string>

<string>I've been in CS ever since 2008 and it's 2016, so about eight years and I wouldn't say I'm really perfect at it. I think to be one of the, to make a high salary in computer science you have to be really good at it, that's hands down. If you're just kinda average then you'll make an average salary so, but having a really good job is on the top of every computer scientist's mind, but not everybody is so great at it. So me I'm in Japan, I'm studying a lot I open books and watch online tutorials to try to get to that point. If I don't get to that point, then maybe I would try to do something similar to computer science, but maybe not specifically on, there's web designing, there's Electrician's Mate, there are lots of jobs that like, for instance a director. Those could be jobs. So I think if other people, if other computer scientists are like me, then I guess they might become discouraged because the job that they're trying to do is difficult, and it's hard to learn those difficult things.</string>

<string>I think that there will be two major things that anybody who knows you would kind of think about you after you join the military. Number one is they'll give you a lot of respect. They know what the military does you know, everybody knows like how the military you know fights these wars and if they're Americans then they probably have, they give a lot of credit for risking your life for them. Number two they will probably be scared. They'd be scared for your life, especially if you're going to go fight a war, and they'd be scared for your safety, because the military has a lot of dangerous places outside of war. So respect for you and fear for you. If you can kind of manage those two, then you can kind of convince them hey you know like the military could be the right choice, and as much as you want my safety, you have to realize like the job I'm trying to do is for everybody's benefit.</string>

<string>Once you join the military then you're a part of a group that really wants you to succeed, especially educationally. So we have this thing called tuition assistance, it provides you $2,500 per month, actually $2,500 in one year to take any community college class that you want. We also have the Montgomery GI Bill, which was changed to the 9-11 educational benefit for people who have served and who get out of the military and want to continue on their, continue their education. You can use it while in the military but it's kind of a waste because they don't give you as much as people who get out actually get. There's also Ihis thing called CLEP (College-Level Examination Program) it's basically they allow you to take some courses that provide community college course credit, that's specifically for the military, and many of those CLEP courses are free. So you can actually like work towards your college degree with those CLEP courses for like while you're on deployment, which is when you're out fighting a war for six months, or when you're back home on shore during your off time. You can also like do some kind of online community college courses or you can take university courses. They provide lots of veterans benefits, maybe free benefits that you can take the class or a reduced price.</string>

<string>The advancement potential that you have when you're in the military really depends on the job that you have. So I'm an Electrician's Mate, nuclear trained. So at the end of six or eight years, many people actually leave the service, so because that happens there's a wide open range for people that want to keep progressing, because like the top is open, so that means that you know they train and then once they get to that point, because nobody  is ahead of them, then they get the rate. There's also lots of Electrician's Mates available, like jobs available. So if you're in a job that has only a few spots available, like let's say it's a very specific job for a specific ship, or a job that's really really nice, really comfortable and no one wants to leave, then that means that those higher positions are staying there, they don't retire after eight years or ten years, they stay until twenty. That means that that's gonna block. So it would be helpful for you to figure out which job you're getting and try to ask about the advancement potential early on so that you know that you're in a job that can promote easily and fast.</string>

<string>When you're transferring to civilian life, it really depends on what type of job you had when you were in the military service. So I was an Electrician's Mate, which means that the word electrician is a part of lots of jobs out there, so it shouldn't be too difficult to find a job that kind of fits my job on the ship. I was also a nuclear technician and obviously there are much fewer jobs out there for that, but they can be found. So every job in the military has a basic breakdown of all the things that they performed in very general categories. So some are more transferable than others. If you worked on nuclear weapons then chances are there aren't that many jobs for you. Comparatively there aren't that many jobs out there. However, if you're a cook let's say, then you know every city, every town, every shop, every place that that has shops for cooks has a job that you can apply for. So it really depends on the type of job that you get.</string>

<string>A story that really shows what it's like to be in the military, I have to say will be Oliver Stone's Full Metal Jacket. If you haven't watched it, go ahead and watch it because then you'll understand what boot camp is like, and the time that he had after the boot camp scene was during a war and it depends on when you're watching this whether you are in a war or not, but I think everything from the way that they talk to each other to the uniforms that they wear, to the jokes that they make, it's very very similar to how military people act. So you should watch that movie and then you'll have a much better idea about what the Navy is like.</string>

<string>I'm in the military reserves, and it is exactly what the name says. It's a reserve, so we don't actively fight the wars. What we do is we, number one make sure that we are prepared to fight, and number two we train a lot to make sure that our mind is ready to fight. For me I was in the military for eight years, and then I got out joined the reserves. What that means is that the reserves call me at any time and they'll have somebody with eight years of active duty experience being able to fight. That means I know what a ship is, I know how to read the label plates to find out what I'm looking for, I know how to fix these pumps, and I know how to drive the ship, I know the valves to close when you're trying to shut off steam. So these are things that they don't have to teach me, as opposed to a civilian who has no experience, no training, and maybe that doesn't have the discipline to come and fight the war right away. So if we're going to fight a war, first people that go over are the active duty people. If you need more people then they call on me, the reservist people, a reserve person who stops his normal civilian job and becomes an active duty member for the amount of time that the Navy tells me to be. It could be anywhere from a few months to several years. After that time, then I'm supposed to come back to my civilian job, hopefully the civilian job is still there for me when I get back. If there's a huge war, then that's when we start calling the real civilians.</string>

<string>To become an officer you need two basic things. Number one you need a college degree time, that's a requirement. Number two you need to be able to present a good managerial style, people need to think that you can lead. Just because you have a degree doesn't mean that you have the authority or, doesn't mean that you have the presence of command to get people to follow you. So once you're going through the officer training program they either teach that to you or they don't allow you to join the military service. They would basically kick you out, so you need a college degree and you need to be able to supervise other people.</string>

<string>With any job it's incredibly important to have a good source of feedback for the jobs that you do. If you're in a position where like you supervisor doesn't give you the the feedback that you need, he doesn't show you the right way to do things. What the Navy is really good for is having multiple resources to go to. So of course if you have one chief above you and you're an enlisted person and he's not listening to you, then what they say is that you can go above him. It's not generally expected that you do that, but it is possible you know. Everybody from the captain of the ship all the way down for the most part has an open door policy, which means that if something is on your mind you can come talk to them. Generally they like you to follow the hierarchy. So the first question that they are going to ask is "did you ask the person underneath me?" so beside you, if you have a problem with someone above you, you talk to the people to your left or right. Then you talk to the people, let's say it's a chief that you're complaining about, then you talk to another chief. And then, if neither of those listen, then maybe the senior chief or maybe the officer of the unit and onwards up. So if you have a problem your feedback, then there are lots of resources that you can go to.</string>

<string>Some of the most important decisions that I've faced have to do with morality I would say. So here's what I mean. The most important thing that you can do in the military is follow directions, but not everybody does that, unfortunately, and your tasks as a supervisor is to confront these things and take care of them appropriately. So this is what I mean. Let's say that there is somebody on the ship, coming onto the ship any he's drunk and he's not supposed to be drunk. What do you do? So you could either grab him by the collar and take him to the local Master at Arms this person in trouble right, and that's the right thing to do. Another right thing to do would be to chastise him, to handle it in house to make sure that he doesn't do it again to kind of supervise and mentor him, if you think that he's that type of person so you don't have to necessarily ruin his career. So basically it's a morality question, the type of personality that you have and how willing to stick to the books you are to make sure that you do the right thing. When it comes to things that are going on in the plants, things that are going on in the engineering field there's no morality involved. If that thing is leaking you don't think hey you know like should I fix it or not, it's not that big. No if it's leaking, if X then Y. But when you're dealing with people, people with personalities, people with emotions, people with families, you have to really take all of that into consideration and to determine the wise thing to do, not necessarily the thing that's written in the book.</string>

<string>The person who probably gave me the best advice about my life I have to say, it would be my friends, especially my Navy friends. I have a good friend he was a fellow nuclear electrician with me, we've been learning computer science together, we fought through our electrician trainings together, and he went off and did his own thing and just a conversation that we had you know like sitting around with some coffee or some beers, we talked about like well what do you want to be? Well I wanna be this. What do you want to be? For instance he actually taught me a lot about mortgages and stuff. I read this book that he presented its called Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki, and after reading that book then I kinda got ideas like okay rather than the cubicle thing I probably want to make my own business or something. I'd rather you know like have some kind of other income rather than a nine to five job. Or rather we would talk about his prior relationship and the fact that like his wife maybe didn't want to work so much. And we thought about like the income and outcome of his of a one working party system. You know like if one person doesn't work and the other person just takes care of the kids, then I guess you can't be as rich as you normally would be. So that had an effect on me, the person that I wanna meet in the future. Do I want like a housewife, which is fine you know. She could have a decent life making kids and you know making dinner and you know folding clothes. Or do I want a someone who's working, in which case like my clothes would suffer, my kids who suffer, my household chores would suffer you know. So like things like that are very very important to consider and to consider wisely and the fireside chats with my friend actually got me to think about my life, my future life very very very hard.</string>

<string>The most important lesson that I've learned about life, I don't know if it's true or not, but I say that you should follow your passion. That's what I'm doing myself. Hopefully I'll eventually reach that goal or at least you know fight the good fight or smiling until my death bed trying to follow my passion. I guess if I were following my passion then I would probably be in a nice paying job with a nice car and a nice house down the street in a nice cul de sac. But for some reason I feel like what I wanna do is, I want to own my own business one day, or I want to make some really outstanding computer science product. So because I'm doing that, it feels like my life is worth doing. Rather than me working for someone else, helping someone else make their dream come true, making the best Pepsi can in the world, or making the best table in the world, or making power for people of Orange County you know. All of those are are honorable professions, but it's something that I didn't come up with, it's not something that I wanted to do. So I'll try to do something I want to do and so far I'm glad that I'm doing it, so that's my suggestion for other people as well.</string>

<string>Something that's really important in life, although I don't really have it in abundance myself. It's your connection with other people, be it your family, be it your close friends, be it your coworkers. You should really try to put yourself out there in the world, try to become you know a part of this world. I know that sounds very theoretical, but like if you're living in isolation, yes you're playing your video games, yes your studying all day and all night, and if you don't have that much interaction with other people in real life, then I think that you're missing out on something that is a really really really critical to make this world go round you know. I think you'd find yourself smiling a lot more every day and finding a better peace when you don't have any enemies around you, when you are looking out for your brothers and your sisters beside you.</string>
