For reference, these are the commands needed to get the website running. This was done on Ubuntu EC2 before dokerization happened (Python was already installed).
However, I recommend you use 

sudo apt-get install docker.io
sudo apt install nodejs-legacy
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo apt install npm
git clone https://github.com/benjamid/MentorPAL.git
cd MentorPAL/website_version
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install keras
pip3 install tensorflow
pip3 install gensim
pip3 install sklearn
pip3 install nltk

copy over/get vectormodel
copy to root of website the mentors files

Also install nltk dependency with python:
python3 (to open shell)
import nltk
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')

sudo node app

**note an ec2 Micro needs a swap file as well to get enough memory (about 1.5gb total ram works)
