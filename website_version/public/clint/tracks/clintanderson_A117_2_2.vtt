The most important things that you can put on a resume are, number one

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.400
 how you worked as a team concerning the job that is being applied for. So

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.670
 for instance if I was applying to be a mechanic on a submarine,

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.940
 then I'd have to look at my past and say okay well what things are

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.210
 associated with the submarine, right, and then that I did in my past

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.490
 life, and then how did I work as a team to make that project better.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.760
 So maybe you were a car mechanic before and you're trying to apply

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.030
 for this mechanical job, then you're gonna talk about the other teammates

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.300
 on your car engineer team that you talk to, that you provided

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.580
 support to, that you supervised, and obviously the dates so that

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.850
 they can see that you have a big range of experience with that.
