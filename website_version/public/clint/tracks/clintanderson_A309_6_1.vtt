00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.490
If you're going to be in engineering then chances are you gonna be on

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.120
 the higher end of the salary spectrum so you shouldn't really let money

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.760
 be the goal, be the, be the reason that you choose a field however

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.400
 from what I understand I think petroleum engineers probably make

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.030
 the most money followed by chemical engineers, computer science is pretty

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.670
 high up there I think last time I saw we were like third on the

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.300
 list or something followed by electric electronics engineers, electrical

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.940
 engineers, mechanics but no matter what you're, if, if you've

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.580
 been in for several years you're probably looking at $100,000 per year

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.210
 or more regardless of whatever engineering field you start with.
