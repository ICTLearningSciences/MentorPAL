00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.480
Personally I have not really traveled so much in planes and trains and

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.110
 automobiles in the military. Basically you just go to work and it's

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.740
 just like a full time job. You go there, you do your job ,and you go

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.380
 home in your own car. However there are some opportunities you know,

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.010
 few and far between, that you do get to ride in the cool, or at least

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.640
 see the cool military vehicles. So for instance when I got to my

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.270
 first aircraft carrier I did something that most people don't do,

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.900
 I actually flew in because they were fighting the Iraq war. I actually

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.530
 flew in on a huge jet to land on the aircraft carrier. Mostly only

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.170
 the officers do that, they're the ones who take off in the jets on

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.800
 the aircraft carrier. Also if you're on leave, you can actually take

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.430
 off in a jet to go to different places in America and across the world

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.060
 as long as you're on leave and you have the right permission to.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.690
 So you can go from a military base, we call Space-A flights, and it's

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.320
 either cheap or very very free. But otherwise you don't really get

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.960
 to do it so much. The thing I used to do was I would go up on vulture's

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.590
 row, which is like one of the highest points on the aircraft

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.220
 carrier, and you see the jets take off. So that's about as close as

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.850
 I could get to dealing with Navy jets.
