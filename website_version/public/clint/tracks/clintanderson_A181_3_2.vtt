The gender mix is very male oriented, just like any engineering job. any

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 engineering academic field, they sway over to to men. So the Navy's

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.850
 pretty good about that, the Air Force is the best I think, they're

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 you know getting close to like sixty forty percent maybe even higher, male

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.850
 to female ratio. I think the Navy is a little bit lower it's

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.850
 from what I understand, maybe my aircraft carrier was one quarter

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 female, at least that's kind of what I saw, and that's about what it

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 was. But it could be lower, maybe twenty percent is probably what I'm

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.850
 guessing. The engineering field of the Navy is, on submarines depends

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.850
 you know which ones you're going on. If it's a fast attack submarine

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.850
 I think they just barely started just a couple years ago started

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 allowing females on, and if you're on a ballistic submarine, which

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.850
 means they shoot nukes off, nuclear weapons off, then they don't have

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.850
 females on there at all.
