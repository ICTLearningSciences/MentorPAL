00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.680
The most difficult part of training I gotta say, it's probably the material,

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.520
 at least for nuclear technology. I wasn't a very good student.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.350
 I got good grades but it was really difficult for me to learn the

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.180
 material myself. Like for instance one of the things that we learned

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.020
 is what grounds are you know, and it took me so long to figure out

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.850
 what a ground is, like ground they say it's the earth you know. Like

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.680
 what do you mean by that? Eventually you find out that ground means

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.520
 that that's a plane of neutral electricity so that you can have high

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.350
 voltage and low voltage and ground means, and there is a way to learn

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.180
 it but it just took me a really long time to learn it because I

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.020
 wasn't really technical. So that's a really simple thing I learned that

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.850
 you know like I had to catch up on, but they're a lot more complex

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.680
 things you know, like when you learned about multiplexes, you're

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.520
 learning about the way that the voltage regulator really works on the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.350
 inside you know. Those can be really difficult so it's a wrap your

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.180
 head around, but eventually with enough opening the pages and putting

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.020
 your eyes on it over and over and over, it become simple. Everything

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.850
 becomes simple with lots of practice.
