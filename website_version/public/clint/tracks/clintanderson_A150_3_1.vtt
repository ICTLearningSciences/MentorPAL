00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.850
The person who gave me the best advice about my career would probably

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 be the people that are really close to me when I was going through each

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.850
 of the jobs that I was going to be. So for instance it would probably

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 be the people beside me when I was going to school. That would

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.850
 be like maybe the teachers or the instructors. Once I got to my first

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.850
 ship it would probably be the chiefs and the senior chiefs who kind

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 of gave me at least some kind of motivation to be like them. They

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 didn't really teach me, well I didn't get the advice from the things

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.850
 that they showed me, but it's more like the way to be a chief, the

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.850
 way to be in the military you know. That part is like more valuable

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.850
 for me wanting to stay in the military and keep in the military rather

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 than like this is how you charge an electrical device or something

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.850
 like that so. After I got out of the military, I actually was looking

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.850
 more towards the people not even in the military. So I'm in USC's,

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.850
 University of Southern California's Institute for Creative Technologies,

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.850
 and I've gotten a lot of really good advice for my military

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.850
 career from people who aren't even in the military themselves. Just

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.850
 because they have, they understand what it takes to be in the military

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.850
 and where the future of the military lies. And kind of without that

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.850
 advice, I guess I wouldn't think about the military in a civilian

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.850
 type of way. So I'm really thankful to all three of them, the instructors,

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.850
 the chiefs and senior chiefs, and the civilians who had an

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.850
 influence on my life and my military career.
