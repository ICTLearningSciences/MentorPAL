00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.680
So, I have a childhood that's pretty similar to many military people that

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.520
 I meet. When I was young, my parents divorced. My father, he was

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.350
 in the army. So I didn't see him that much. I lived with my mother

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.180
 for a long time. We moved from state to state. I lived in Washington

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.020
 for a while, I lived in Alabama for a while. Eventually, I moved back

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.850
 with my father instead of my mother, in California. So, I have actually

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.680
 seen a lot of America, thanks to their divorce. Eventually, I

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.520
 graduated from high school and after high school, me and my father

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.350
 we didn't really get along so I broke away from him and a couple of

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.180
 years afterwards I realized that I needed some kind of jobs help me

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.020
 with my finances, help me, you know find some kind of direction in life.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.850
 So, that's when I joined the US Navy Reserve and the US Navy.
