STEM careers range all types of ways, it's very stressful, it's very fun,

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.560
 it's very communicative, if you want it to be, a just like any job

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.920
 it depends on the company that you're working for and what what product

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.280
 they are producing so for instance you can work for a company

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.640
 that is making games and you're sitting at a table and there could

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.990
 be five to ten other people at that same table you know there's no walls

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.350
 you just study with them and talk with them to chat with them and

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.710
 play video games during during lunch time. There are other companies

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.060
 where you have your own cubicle and if you don't want to talk to

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.420
 anyone the whole entire day, eat lunch by yourself, then you're more

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.780
 than welcome to do that. So it depends on what project you're working

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.140
 on, whether you're making an aircraft, whether you're making a video

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.490
 game, whether you're making the newest electronics and the people

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.850
 that you're working with.
