00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.850
To become an officer you need two basic things. Number one you need a

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 college degree time, that's a requirement. Number two you need to be

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.850
 able to present a good managerial style, people need to think that

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 you can lead. Just because you have a degree doesn't mean that you have

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.850
 the authority or, doesn't mean that you have the presence of command

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.850
 to get people to follow you. So once you're going through the officer

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 training program they either teach that to you or they don't

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 allow you to join the military service. They would basically kick you

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.850
 out, so you need a college degree and you need to be able to supervise

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.850
 other people.
