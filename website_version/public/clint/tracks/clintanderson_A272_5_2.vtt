00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.780
If you do something bad in the Navy, then your punishment can range from

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.720
 just having extended watch, which means that you have to work a little

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.650
 bit longer at the end of the day, or doing extra cleaning duties,

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.580
 getting a write up that says hey you know what he did this on this

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.520
 date with this thing and you know from now on he has to make sure

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.450
 that he doesn't do it again and if he does then the punishment will

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.380
 be more severe. That's a report. However, depending on how severe it

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.320
 is, for instance, it goes up after that. If you were caught drinking

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.250
 underage, then you could be behind bars, down in the brig, you might

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.180
 not be reduced in rate. If it's even worse, for instance if you

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.120
 desert the ship during time of war you could actually be put to death.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.050
 Those are few and far between and that's, they haven't done that

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.980
 for a long time. But those are the ranges of the punishments that you

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.920
 can have. Either almost nothing, you know just a day's worth of work

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.850
 to death.
