MWR stands for morale, recreation, and welfare. That's basically the military's

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.760
 leisure association, you go in there you can ask them anything

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.210
 from hiking equipment, camping equipment, maybe they can show you

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.670
 a place to shoot guns. If you're in a foreign country they can tell

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.120
 you all the different places around that you can enjoy yourself.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.580
 So for instance in San Diego, they told us where Disneyland is, Seaworld,

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:39.030
 how to go to Mexico safely, how to go to Las Vegas, all the things

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.490
 that are around San Diego. They also give you cheaper rates than

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.940
 civilians can get. So basically if you're in any place that has MWR

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.400
 that's the first place to go when you want to try to do something

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.850
 fun out in the community.
