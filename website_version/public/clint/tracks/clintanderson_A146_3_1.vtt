00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.320
We definitely don't get to swim in the middle of the ocean. So, I actually

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.800
 did get to swim in the ocean but that's not very common. One day

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.270
 it was like really hot, we had been out to sea for a month, two months,

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.740
 people were getting antsy. So we had a swim call. So what happened

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.220
 was our aircraft carrier was, it came to a full stop, we had navy

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.690
 seals in boats around the water with guns to shoot sharks, and we

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.170
 could jump from the elevator, the aircraft elevator, which is really

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.640
 far far up. It's about like a five or six second drop, once you drop

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.110
 over the edge. It's kinda like a diving board. So you jump over the

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.590
 edge, you go down in this beautiful bath water, and keep going then

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.060
 it gets really cold, then you come back up and it's warm again, and

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.530
 then you're supposed to swim to the back of the ship. So it's about

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.010
 another maybe, minute more to go to the back, and then you have to

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.480
 get out. So it's not like you can like hang out there you know swim,

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.960
 throw a frisbee around, like play volleyball or anything. It's like

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.430
 you jump across, go down in the water, and then you come out, and

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.900
 you swim to the back. You can do that many times you know, but I did

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.380
 it once just to see. I think I actually did it twice. It was kinda

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.850
 fun, I can barely swim so that's good enough for me.
