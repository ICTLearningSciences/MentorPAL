00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.850
I've been in CS ever since 2008 and it's 2016, so about eight years and

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 I wouldn't say I'm really perfect at it. I think to be one of the,

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.850
 to make a high salary in computer science you have to be really good

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 at it, that's hands down. If you're just kinda average then you'll

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.850
 make an average salary so, but having a really good job is on the top

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.850
 of every computer scientist's mind, but not everybody is so great

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 at it. So me I'm in Japan, I'm studying a lot I open books and watch

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 online tutorials to try to get to that point. If I don't get to that

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.850
 point, then maybe I would try to do something similar to computer

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.850
 science, but maybe not specifically on, there's web designing, there's

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.850
 Electrician's Mate, there are lots of jobs that like, for instance

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 a director. Those could be jobs. So I think if other people, if other

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.850
 computer scientists are like me, then I guess they might become

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.850
 discouraged because the job that they're trying to do is difficult,

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.850
 and it's hard to learn those difficult things.
