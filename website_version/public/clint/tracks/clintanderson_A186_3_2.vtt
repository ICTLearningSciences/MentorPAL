00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.750
Once you join the military then you're a part of a group that really wants you

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.650
 to succeed, especially educationally. So we have this thing

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.550
 called tuition assistance, it provides you $2,500 per month, actually

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.450
 $2,500 in one year to take any community college class that you want.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.350
 We also have the Montgomery GI Bill, which was changed to the 9-11

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.250
 educational benefit for people who have served and who get out of

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.150
 the military and want to continue on their, continue their education.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.050
 You can use it while in the military but it's kind of a waste because

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.950
 they don't give you as much as people who get out actually get. There's

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.850
 also Ihis thing called CLEP (College-Level Examination Program)

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.750
 it's basically they allow you to take some courses that provide

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.650
 community college course credit, that's specifically for the military,

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.550
 and many of those CLEP courses are free. So you can actually like

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.450
 work towards your college degree with those CLEP courses for like

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.350
 while you're on deployment, which is when you're out fighting a war for

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.250
 six months, or when you're back home on shore during your off time.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.150
 You can also like do some kind of online community college courses or

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.050
 you can take university courses. They provide lots of veterans

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.950
 benefits, maybe free benefits that you can take the class or a reduced

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.850
 price.
