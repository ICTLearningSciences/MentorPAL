00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.970
For computer science, we're always changing things, all the time. So,

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.090
 this is the difference between the people that survived the dot crash

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.210
 and the people that had to go. So, an example would be, let's say

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:21.330
 Kodak, Kodak is a maker of cameras. They had the Polaroid camera. However,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.450
 eventually people started using digital cameras. People started

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.570
 using their phones for cameras and rather than take advantage of

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.690
 this technology, Kodak, kind of, just sat with their usual product and

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.810
 as we can see, where people started to switch over their photo taking

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.930
 format, Kodak started to decline. Another example would be Netflix.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.050
 So, I'm sorry, Netflix is an online video producer, who took over

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.170
 the big reign that Blockbuster used to have. Blockbuster was a big

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.290
 building that you go inside, you choose whichever video you wanted

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.410
 to, you take it up to the front, you pay your money and and you take

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.530
 the video for three days, then you're supposed to bring it back. If

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.650
 you don't bring it back, then you have to pay these fees. And Netflix

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.770
 kind of saw that and then they made an online video retailer store.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.890
 And Blockbuster didn't follow suit with that and that's why they,

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.010
 kind of, like, I think, went belly-up. Maybe they're still around

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.130
 but they didn't get with the times. So, my point for saying this, with

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.250
 Kodak, with Blockbuster, you have to look a couple years in the future,

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.370
 maybe even longer and wherever you see technology going, that's

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.490
 where you have to change. Now, there's a big impetus for people to

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.610
 have a working product and say, "This is our goal, this is the thing

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.730
 that we do." But if you don't switch, if you don't change, then I'm

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.850
 sorry, technology is going to run you to the ground.
