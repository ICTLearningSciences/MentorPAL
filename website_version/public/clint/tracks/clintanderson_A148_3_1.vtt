00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.290
Deployment is what it's called when a Navy vessel goes to an extended

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.730
 deployment to fight a war or do some training. So my ship, the USS John

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.160
 C. Stennis, we actually went from our home port in San Diego and

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.600
 we went to the Middle East and swam in the ocean there. We didn't swim

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.040
 we rode on the boat right, but around the Arabian gulf, around the

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.470
 surrounding islands, maybe around Singapore. And just in that general

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.910
 area while the war was going on and we stayed there for six months,

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.350
 and then we come back home to San Diego. So once you're home to

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.790
 your home for then you do go out on the ship sometimes, but you don't

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.230
 go out for that long, and you don't go out that far. But deployment

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.660
 is, that's when your family comes, you know you say goodbye to your

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.100
 significant other, you know you tap your kids on the shoulder and

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.540
 say you know be good to your dad or your mom, you pack your bags up

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.970
 and then it's a big farewell ceremony you know and then everybody there

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.410
 waits for you to come back six or seven or eight months later.
