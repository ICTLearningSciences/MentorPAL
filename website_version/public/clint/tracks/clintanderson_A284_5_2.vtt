00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.710
The typical education level that you can experience in the military, it

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.560
 really depends on well number one whether you go enlisted or officer.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.420
 Starting with the officers because they're easy, in order to be

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.280
 an officer you automatically have to have a degree. There are some officers

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.140
 who don't, but ninety-nine percent of them, they start off with

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.990
 a degree. You can become a lieutenant and even higher, there are

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.850
 many captains who don't have advanced degrees. However, to get very

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.710
 high, you are generally expected to get a master's at least. That's

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.560
 around the O5/O6-ish level because they like to see education. Going

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.420
 to enlisted people, you don't need any degree for the whole entire

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.280
 time that you're in. However, education is looked upon highly and if

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.140
 you do have a degree your chances for promotion to be honest, are

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.990
 a lot higher. Up to my rate, E7, it's really not looked on as being

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.850
 a requirement. However, from my rate and above, that's E7 and above,

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.710
 so that's E7, E8, and E9, they really spur on the education. So education

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.560
 in any way, if you've taken vocational classes, that's a check

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.420
 mark. If you have your degree while you're in the military, that's

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.280
 another big check mark too. So any education at all, whether it's from

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.140
 a traditional college, whether it's your own personal learning and

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.990
 you took CLEP (College Level Examination Program) classes or online

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.850
 classes, anything will set you apart from the others.
