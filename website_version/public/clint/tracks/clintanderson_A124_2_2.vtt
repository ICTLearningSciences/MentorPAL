00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.200
So one thing that I regret when I was growing up is that, although I was

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.560
 a really good student when I was in elementary school, when I was

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.910
 in middle school, and even high school, then things started to kind

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.260
 of fall off and kind of whither away. I didn't have a strong relationship

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.610
 with my family so I kinda just did my own thing, I was very independent

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.970
 and unfortunately I wasn't really good at doing homework

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.320
 and stuff. So yeah, I got the first F in my life when I was a senior,

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.670
 first D's you know as a junior, and you know I mean, if I would have

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.030
 just kept being an awesome student throughout high school, then who

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.380
 is to say that my life wouldn''t have gone in a completely different

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.730
 direction. Maybe I could have wound up at an Ivy League school or

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.090
 something. Who knows? But because I didn't listen to my mom and dad

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.440
 tell me to do my homework and you know eat my vegetables, then I had,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.790
 I was almost forced to join the military. I'm glad that I did join

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.140
 the military, it gave me an option to you know make something of

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.500
 myself, but I think I would have had a lot more opportunities if I would

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.850
 have listened to my parents.
