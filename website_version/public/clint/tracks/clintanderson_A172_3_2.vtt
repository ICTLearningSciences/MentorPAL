00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.500
The most difficult part about learning what computer science is and getting

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.140
 into it is getting past the first block that you have, that I

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.790
 had thinking that it's difficult, thinking that computer science is

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.440
 something for other people. Think about, thinking that it's for smart

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.090
 people, for math people, or for people that got 4.0's in school you

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.730
 know. It's not you know, you have a wide range just like any other

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.380
 job out there, so once you get past that then you have to realize the

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.030
 book that you're reading maybe is written by computer scientists

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.670
 themselves you know. So there could be a time when you have to close

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.320
 the book and go you know prep yourself a little bit more you know,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.970
 find some material online, find some easy to understand topics that

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.610
 can kind of prep you to go back to the more difficult book that you're

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.260
 reading in your hands. So yeah the material can be hard sometimes,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.910
 the projects that we have can be you know really demanding, but with

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.560
 enough time you know, they say seven years you become an expert.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.200
 Ten thousand hours you become an expert so you put in that time, then

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.850
 you will learn computer science.
