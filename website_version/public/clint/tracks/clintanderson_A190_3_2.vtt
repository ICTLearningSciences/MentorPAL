WEBVTT FILE:

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.210
I'm in the military reserves, and it is exactly what the name says. It's

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.580
 a reserve, so we don't actively fight the wars. What we do is we,

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.940
 number one make sure that we are prepared to fight, and number two

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.300
 we train a lot to make sure that our mind is ready to fight. For me

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.670
 I was in the military for eight years, and then I got out joined the

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.030
 reserves. What that means is that the reserves call me at any time

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.400
 and they'll have somebody with eight years of active duty experience

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.760
 being able to fight. That means I know what a ship is, I know how to

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.120
 read the label plates to find out what I'm looking for, I know how

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.490
 to fix these pumps, and I know how to drive the ship, I know the valves

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.850
 to close when you're trying to shut off steam. So these are things

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.210
 that they don't have to teach me, as opposed to a civilian who has

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.580
 no experience, no training, and maybe that doesn't have the discipline

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.940
 to come and fight the war right away. So if we're going to fight

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.300
 a war, first people that go over are the active duty people. If you

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.670
 need more people then they call on me, the reservist people, a reserve

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.030
 person who stops his normal civilian job and becomes an active

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.400
 duty member for the amount of time that the Navy tells me to be. It

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.760
 could be anywhere from a few months to several years. After that time,

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.120
 then I'm supposed to come back to my civilian job, hopefully the

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.490
 civilian job is still there for me when I get back. If there's a huge

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.850
 war, then that's when we start calling the real civilians.
