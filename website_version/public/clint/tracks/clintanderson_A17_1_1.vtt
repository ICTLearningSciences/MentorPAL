00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.000
So, my job as an EMC, Electrician's Mate is to fix pumps, to do preventive

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.160
 maintenance, to work on voltage regulators, to have lots of training

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.310
 as well. But the Navy also provides you with releases from your

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.470
 job. If you do the same job the whole entire time, you might get kind

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.620
 of frustrated, so I actually worked in the supply department which

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.770
 is where, for instance, there is the veins in the ship and there's

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.930
 like painting that needs to be done, there's lots of cleaning that

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.080
 has to be done. Some people work in the tech pubs library, which means

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.230
 that there's books for everybody on the ship that has to do their

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.390
 job. So you can work there for a while. So, basically for about six

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.540
 months to a year, you work in your main job and then they kind of

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.700
 give you a break even though you're on the same ship and then you have

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.850
 that cycle. So, you're always doing something different.
