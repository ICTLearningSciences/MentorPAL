The food in the military it's, I have to say it's outstanding. Maybe not

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 many people would agree with that because it's kind of plain and

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.850
 bland. So you have your cafeteria style you know, style food. You go

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 there, I want some meat, I want some potatoes, I want some broccoli,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.850
 you know. And they provide a good selection for you. They don't really

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.850
 season it so much because so many people come through you know,

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 it's not like it's Applebee's or anything. They allow you season it

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 yourself, so as long as you kind of realize that you know, then they

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.850
 give you big portions for little cost, or no cost if you're active

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.850
 duty, and technically it is healthy you know. In fact I think that

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.850
 they recently took salt away from the table so like you have to try

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 to be healthy when you eat your food, and it delivers.
