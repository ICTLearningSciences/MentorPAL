00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.300
So you should probably keep looking at the job that you want to persue

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.760
 there's a lot to learn and I've been doing this job for a long time

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.210
 and there's always things that I can still learn but you want to have

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.670
 a solid foundation so that if someone asks you what an electrician

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.120
 does what a computer science does then you can respond in a decent

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.580
 way even though you might not have done it before or know about it

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.030
 yourself personally as long as you can give that that saying to someone

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.490
 then you're on the right track after that go on the internet you

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.940
 know browse what different people do that might not help so much because

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.400
 for instance you can type in Mark Zuckerberg and you'll see that

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.850
 he does all these things but you don't know exactly how he does it

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.300
 so the next best thing would be to see the things that professionals

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.760
 do and then start doing them. So for instance, computer scientists

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.210
 they learn a language C#, C++ so probably start on you're own language

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.670
 the kind of engineers they work on little robotic stuff movable

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.120
 things so for instance find something at Radio Shack that you can start

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.580
 working on you want to have some kind of portfolio that you can

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.030
 if you can manage it  you want to have some kind of portfolio that

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.490
 you can show to other people to prove that hey ya know like I'm interested

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.940
 in this career and I think from that point on the next thing

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.400
 that you're suppose to do are gonna start falling down like dominoes.
