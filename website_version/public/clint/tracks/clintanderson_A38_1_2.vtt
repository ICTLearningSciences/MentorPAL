00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.050
The main thing that a new Navy person has to learn is that you have to

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.250
 be able to follow directions. If you can do that, then you'll be fine.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.450
 If you've ever seen the movie Forrest Gump, this is a person who

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.650
 had an incredible military career and the only thing that he did was

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.850
 just follow the directions that people give him and that's basically

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.050
 the truth. You won't get in trouble if you follow the directions

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.250
 that people give you. You'll do your job well just by following the

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.450
 procedures that are in front of you and in fact, the main reason that

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.650
 people get in trouble is because they deviate from that. The Chief

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.850
 tells him, "Hey, go on to the billet and scrub it out" and then he

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.050
 doesn't feel like it. So, he gets in trouble. The Chief tells him, "Hey,

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.250
 you know what? Read this procedure A, B, C and D. Don't deviate"

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.450
 and he thinks that he wants to do it really faster or really quicker

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.650
 or you know and so, it never works out. So as long as you follow

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.850
 directions, you'll be fine.
