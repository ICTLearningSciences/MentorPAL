00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.970
Some of the ribbons that I've received include the pistol ribbon and the

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.100
 rifle ribbon, both experts. I received the sea service deployment

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.230
 ribbon, which means that I went on a ship. Some people in the Navy

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.350
 don't do that, so the ones who do, they get that. I've also received

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.470
 a expeditionary ribbon for my ship because we did a really good job

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.600
 out there when we were doing training, and I was a big part of that.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.730
 I've won a few other ones, in total I've won about thirteen more.
