If you have a spouse, a husband or wife, or even another boyfriend or

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.780
 girlfriend who you are very close to doesn't really understand the requirements

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.250
 of the navy, I would suggest that the military person present

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.720
 them with some of the support that the military provides. You

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.180
 have MWR, Morale Recreation and Welfare that can show the spouse or

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.650
 significant other, number one, ways that they can divert themselves.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.120
 If your, let's say husband is out in the ocean you could find yourself

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.580
 very bored, you can find yourself wanting to be around them, to

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.050
 call them all the time. So MWR can show you how to like mingle with

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.520
 other military people, with other military spouses, with other people

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.980
 in the community to kinda like take your mind off  ofthem. They can

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.450
 also provide them with legal support if they're running into some

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.920
 problems while the the husband or wife is away. So as long as the military

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.380
 person shows the spouse all of the support, then they shouldn't,

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.850
 they can overcome their problems.
