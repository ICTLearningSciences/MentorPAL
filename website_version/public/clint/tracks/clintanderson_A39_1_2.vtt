00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.850
When I was on active duty, we get one month per year. So, that's a lot

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.850
 of travel that I'm allowed to do but I didn't do too much of it. Kind

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.850
 of just stayed at home. There's this thing called the 'military bubble'

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.850
 where you kind of just hang out with the people in your same

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 unit and don't really get out that much. And it's fun for a while. You

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.850
 have a lot of money so you can do lots of things, you can take these

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.850
 things called MAC flights where you can, if you're on leave, you

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.850
 can travel across the country for basically free but I think I was

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.850
 just waiting to become a civilian to actually really enjoy myself. So,

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 I just hoarded all my travel days till the very end.
