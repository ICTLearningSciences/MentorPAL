00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.550
The biggest and brightest stars that we have in the STEM fields, obviously,

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.250
 are the ones who are good at math and science but in the general

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.950
 sense, it's more your ability to think about things logically. So,

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.650
 if you're good at puzzles, if you get some kind of question that you

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.350
 don't know the answer to but you're willing to, kind of, research

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.050
 that until you find the solution, then STEM is a good career for you.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.750
 This is what I mean. For me, as an electrician, there isn't that

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.450
 much math that I did and there's not that much science that I did. However,

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.150
 when I'm looking at a circuit and I see that one part is open

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.850
 and I'm familiar with most of the things on the circuit. Well, this

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.550
 is a short, this is a motor, this is a generator, this is a capacitor

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.250
 but there are some things on there that I don't know. If I put down

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.950
 the circuit and say, "Well, I guess that's it." Then, maybe STEM

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.650
 isn't good enough for me, well, maybe I'm not good enough for STEM.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.350
 However if I can look at it and I realize that I don't know the situation

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.050
 and I can turn around to other people or I can look in the book

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.750
 myself and figure out, "Okay, well, so that's what this thing does.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.450
 Well, let's look at the power. I don't understand the way that this

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.150
 math works." So, let me again look to see, like, "Okay, well this

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.850
 goes up, this goes down, this is the function for this" and then look

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.550
 at another book, it's like,"Oh, okay" and then I can backtrack all

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.250
 the way to that component to kind of figure out what it does at the

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.950
 end. If I'm willing to do that process, then STEM is for me. It's

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.650
 kind of like a goose chase. If you like goose chases and the goose chase

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.350
 that you're doing is math and science oriented and that's fun for

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.050
 you, that sounds like something that's fun, then STEM is for you.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.750
 If you just look at a problem and you get really frustrated and you

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.450
 want to throw the book out the window, if you found yourself doing

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.150
 that a lot, then there are other jobs that you might find more interesting

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.850
 and more fun, more satisfying than STEM.
