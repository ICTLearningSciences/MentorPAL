00:0:0.0 --> 00:0:4.0
- I have two favorite foods. When I am in the United States,

00:0:4.0 --> 00:0:8.0
-  my favorite food is ice cream. Haagen Dazs

00:0:8.0 --> 00:0:12.0
-  all the way. But when I'm in Japan, it switches over

00:0:12.0 --> 00:0:16.0
-  to ramen, because they make delicious ramen here.

00:0:16.0 --> 00:0:20.0
-  It doesn't even compare in the US.
