The way that you can be the best at your job, the way that you can work

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.470
 smarter is open up the books. I have to say you know, I wasn't really

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.790
 a STEM engineering type myself you know. I think everybody had an

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.100
 upper hand on me when I first joined, but the difference between me

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.410
 and a lot of other guys and girls while we were going through, the

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.730
 reason that I can really rise through the ranks is because I was opening

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.040
 the books all the time. There's these things called watches that

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.350
 you stand, where you kinda sit in a chair and you like watch gauges

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.660
 and make sure that you know nothing's like exploding. But that's

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.970
 kinda like free time you know, so you can't like read comic books, you

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.290
 can't watch a movie there, so with that spare time they actually

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.600
 tell you, open up the books you know. Open up and keep your training

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.910
 going yourself. So that's what I used to do, that's what I did, and

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.230
 it's, I found out that month after month you know, year after year,

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.540
 my knowledge was steadily improving, and I think it has a lot to do

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.850
 with the fact that I was reading a lot during my watches.
