00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.350
There's a lot of socialization that happens outside of the military for

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.850
 military members. This is what I mean. So you're with these guys from

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.350
 the morning until you know work ends at like four, five o'clock

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.850
 and you would think that hey you know what, in a civilian job you take

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.350
 off you know do my own thing. But it turns out that when these are

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.850
 your friends you know, these are the guys that you're joking around

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.350
 with, these are the guys that you've been on deployment with and you

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.850
 have to see them everyday. You become very much like family you know,

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.350
 very much like brothers and sisters. So as soon as work ends, these

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.850
 same guys are going to be going to the local bar and drinking and chatting

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.350
 and maybe then going to somebody's house and playing video

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.850
 games and stuff so it's very very close here.
