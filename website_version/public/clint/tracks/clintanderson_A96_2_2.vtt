00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.120
My favorite book of all time I have to say is Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse. So I

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.380
 grew up reading mythology, Greek mythology, and maybe magic

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.650
 books, and a few sports books, lots of fables and Aesop's fables,

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.920
 so that's what got me to read. But I didn't really I don't see any very

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.180
 substantial work that you know sold lots of intelligence and Hermann

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.450
 Hesse's work Siddhartha was just what I needed to realize that

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.720
 there are some really bright people out there way brighter than I am

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.980
 who can think of some kind of plot that's very interesting and engaging

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.250
 and Siddhartha, the main character of the story is a lot like me.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.520
 He's introverted, he's wondering about his future, he travels the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.780
 world looking for some kind of solution and the solution is, an answer

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.050
 is given in the book, I don't know if it's a solution, but it made

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.320
 me really self introspect a lot, and I started to read all of Hermann

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.580
 Hesse's work later on and most of it just blew me away so it's

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.850
 a good introduction to very intelligent reading.
