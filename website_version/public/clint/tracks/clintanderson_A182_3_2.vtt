The Navy is pretty diverse. I think it also depends on which location

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:12.720
 you're in, because people tend to go back to where they come from. So

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.650
 let's say South Carolina which is very white then it probably has

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.580
 a higher percentage of white people there. In California, which is very

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:30.520
 very diverse, then you have a lot more of a diverse mix there you

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:36.450
 know so, but despite that wherever there's a military town, it's much

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.380
 more diverse than the outlying area by far so you don't really have

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:48.320
 to worry about being in a select group in the military, it's it's

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.250
 all over the place. So I think from what I saw, there's, percentages

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.180
 would probably go maybe five percent Filipino, maybe ten percent

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.120
 black, maybe fifty percent white, twenty percent Asian, and then the

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:12.050
 rest is a kind of mix. But like I said it really depends on what your

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.980
 rate is. For maybe the higher level rates, it tends to be mostly

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.920
 white and Asian, and it also depends on which city you live in, for

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.850
 there's people that want to come back to live around their family.
