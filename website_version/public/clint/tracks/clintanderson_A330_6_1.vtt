00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.030
I think I'm really fortunate to be born in America. I've had the opportunity

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.210
 to travel all over the world I've been to Kuwait and Bahrain

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.400
 and Dubai Japan Malaysia I've been lots of other places and I've gotten

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.580
 a chance to see the way that different people live. Some are well

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.760
 to do, some not so well to do, and being in the military I kind of

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.940
 see America's role in that and I also see the way that they live compared

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.120
 to other countries and I gotta say just being born in California

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.300
 puts me at such an advantage in the world and I'm very grateful

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.490
 for that, if I can I'll try to help other people as much as I can I

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.670
 feel like I'm doing that I'm hoping that I'm doing that but that's one

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.850
 thing I'm very very grateful for.
