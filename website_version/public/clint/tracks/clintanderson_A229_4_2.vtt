00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.540
There was one time in my career as a Chief, I think it was, like, the

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.220
 second year that I was a Chief, as a supervisor, that my commanding

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.910
 officer made it clear that he wanted to keep people over the time, of

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.590
 the time they were supposed to be leaving, and it was four o'clock.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.280
 I guess we kept people until, like, four thirty or five. I realized

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.960
 that people have to go and so, everyone was sent home. There was something

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.650
 slightly off about one of the sheets of paper that I was supposed

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.340
 to give him. For instance, maybe the name was supposed to written

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.020
 in signature but it was, like kind of, misspelled or something

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.710
 like that. So, something very very small and my commanding officer was

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.390
 really adamant about his people not leaving home so early. So, because

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.080
 I had let them go home early, he wanted them to come back. Now

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.760
 I called and I realized that the person that I let home early was an

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.450
 hour away. My commanding officer wanted him to come back. So, I said

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.140
 it's not in the best interest of that person to drive all the way

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.820
 back just for something small that I could correct. I could have whited

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.510
 it out and typed it on a typewriter and then given it back to him

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.190
 and that paper would have been just as good. So, even though I had

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.880
 a direct order from my commanding officer, "Hey, I want you to come.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.560
 Get him back into this office." As a Chief, one of our main goals

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.250
 is to look out for people to, kind of, make sure that, you know, our

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.940
 morale is kept very high. Those are the type of people that want to

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.620
 work for you. Those are the type of people that say, "You know what?

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.310
 Not only is he my supervisor, but he acts as a human being." So,

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.990
 that's one of the times that I had to, like, stand, you know, at attention

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.680
 and, you know, make it clear, you know, talking to my commanding

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.360
 officer as a person, "Yes, there's this rule and you have this choice

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.050
 but, you know what, here's another option that I'm presenting."

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.740
 And even though I was yelled at, eventually that person didn't have

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.420
 to make the, you know, the two hour trip, just to make a small correction

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.110
 and the job still got done. So, things like that happen all

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.790
 the time as a Chief and you have to, kind of, weigh the amount of risk

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.480
 that you're taking with your own personal career and your own personal

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.160
 evaluation, compared to the kind of morale that you save by acting

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.850
 as a human to your sailors.
