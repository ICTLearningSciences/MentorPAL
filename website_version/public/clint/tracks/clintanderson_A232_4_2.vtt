00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.130
The plan that I have to reach my life goal is to live, and what I mean

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.410
 by that is, I'm doing it right now. I'm doing it today. The goal for

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.680
 me, it has already been accomplished, which is waking up every day,

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.960
 enjoying what it is that you doing. For me, I like going to school,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.240
 I like doing research and I am doing that right now. For the military,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.520
 I like being a supervisor and making sure that the people that

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.790
 I work for are, don't have any problems, can come to me with their questions

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.070
 and I have a ready answer for them. So, my goal has already

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.350
 been fulfilled. Of course, I want to, you know, progress even further

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.630
 in my career and the sky is the limit. I want to be a billionaire,

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.910
 I want to eat nice food and travel all over the world but if I don't

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.180
 make those goals, yes I'll be disappointed but I won't be disheartened

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.460
 because I'm enjoying the life that I have already. So, because

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.740
 I don't have, because I'm already doing what it is I want to do, you

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.020
 might think that I'm not motivated to continue to try to become something

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.290
 better, but it's the exact opposite. It's because I like the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.570
 challenge of whatever I'm doing right now that makes me want to, you

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.850
 know, become even higher later on in life.
