00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.990
GPA your grade point average, for 90% of jobs, doesn't matter at all.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.140
 They just care if you, the fact that you graduated is more than enough.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.280
 Whether you got a C or B or an A, chances are, most of the stuff

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.420
 that you learned in college, you're not going to be using anyways and

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.560
 employers know that. They just want to know if you can have a structured

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.710
 regimen that you follow from beginning to completion, along

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.850
 with other people to succeed in the class and if you'd done that, then

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.990
 good enough. However, some jobs do require you to be an expert in

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:47.140
 your field and although it's not the perfect indication, your grade

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.280
 point average is a high indicator of that success. 3.8s, 3.9s, 4.0s

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.420
 are the things that some of the places are looking for. Google, they

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.560
 take the top. Facebook, Twitter, at least for programmers, they take

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.710
 the top. However, those jobs are only 5%. For the vast majority of

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.850
 the time, GPA doesn't matter.
