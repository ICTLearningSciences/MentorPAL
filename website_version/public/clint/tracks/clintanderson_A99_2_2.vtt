00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.100
I get lots of personal satisfaction from my job. Of course the salary

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.350
 is no joke I make decent money, enough to live and enough to support

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.600
 myself, but the skills that they provide they really go pretty far.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.850
 Whenever I mention the type of work that I do, people's eyes light

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.100
 up and it makes me really proud of being able to say that I work with

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.350
 nuclear technology. Other sources of pride come in the fact that it's

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.600
 not everybody that can actually push an aircraft carrier through

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.850
 the water and I can actually say that my hands touched something that

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.100
 made this huge multibillion dollar piece of equipment go through

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.350
 the water to fight a war. It was me. If I push it twisted this way it

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.600
 would've stopped or did it this way it goes fast. So that's a once

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.850
 in a lifetime experience and adventure.
