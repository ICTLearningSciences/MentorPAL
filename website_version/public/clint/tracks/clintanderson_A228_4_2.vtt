00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.570
In the military, there are rules all over the place. Sometimes it's in

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.290
 the best interest of yourself and the people you work with to break

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.020
 the rules. This can be when you're giving some instructions and you

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.740
 yourself know the right thing to do. In those cases, you have to break

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.460
 the rules. So, this could be, an example could be, let's say you're

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.180
 supposed to do preventive maintenance on these three panels and

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.910
 because your time is, kind of, short, maybe the supervisor says, "Only

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.630
 just do those two. Forget about the third one." Or, "You're supposed

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.350
 to do all three of them and you're supposed to read the notes but

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.070
 just do it as fast as possible" you know, and he tells you that you're

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.790
 supposed to do it in a time that you can't possibly do it in. So,

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.520
 it's okay to break his rules in order to do the procedure correctly.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.240
 You should never disregard the procedure though. If it's written

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.960
 down somewhere in words, don't ever break those rules. If you want

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.680
 to get trouble, if you want to get kicked out of the military, then

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.410
 be my guest, break those rules and, you know, you're going to be the

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.130
 first one out. But when it comes to the things that aren't black and

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.850
 white, when it comes to things that are, kind of, morally right or

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.570
 wrong, then you have to think about it yourself and think, "Well, what

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.290
 was I thought, that's right?"  and so, for instance, an example

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.020
 would be, if you're out and you're at a bar and there's this drunk person

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.740
 and you're supposed to, let's say, bring him home, bring him back

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.460
 to the ship. But you know if you bring him back to the ship, that

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.180
 he's going to get in lots of trouble, maybe he will be kicked out

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.910
 of the military or something like that. Maybe, in that case you'll probably

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.630
 be wise to, for instance, not show him around the town, not

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.350
 show everyone that he's a drunk sailor, not bring him back to the ship

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.070
 so that, you know, he can be, you know, court martialed or something

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.790
 like that. Probably better, you know, think about it as a wise person

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.520
 to break the rule in that case. Find a nice hotel for him and

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.240
 then call your Chief as soon as possible to ask what the right thing

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.960
 to do is. Even though it's past your curfew time, you know, it's better

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.680
 to, you know, think smartly and wisely what's in the best interests

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.410
 of the United States military and do things that take common sense

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.130
 rather than, you know, this is the rule, you have to stand by. So,

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.850
 things like that happen all the time in the military.
