00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.270
I had a good opportunity to meet a really smart Chinese person when I

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.690
 was working as a, when I was education abroad here in Japan. So, I finished

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.110
 and I went to USC to start my master's and he finished and he

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.530
 went back to China to start his start-up. I had to ask him a few questions

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.960
 for the games I was making at USC and he was asking how to

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.380
 design a virtual reality program that he was making for me and we found

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.800
 out that we work pretty well together, you know, we both thought

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.220
 we were pretty smart, we both thought like, we work well together,

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.640
 we made each other laugh, so he said, "Hey, why don't you join my start-up?"

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.060
 So, I was there as a founding member and the games that we're

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.480
 making, we've made many in fact. One is that we used a Kinect to

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.900
 be combined with a Leap Motion controller and you can move around the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.320
 play area in this kind of like virtual reality world, fighting dragons.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.740
 Another game that I made was made with the VIVE controller and

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.170
 where you shoot zombies. The current game that we're making is supposed

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.590
 to be really really popular. It's basically a cross between Super

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.010
 Mario and Legend of Zelda, where you just walk in this world going

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.430
 up and up, trying to fight this monster at the top. It's really cool

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.850
 and it's a, people say it's a lot of fun.
