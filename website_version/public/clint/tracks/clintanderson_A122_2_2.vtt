00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:11.700
The best people to talk to if you're unsure about what you want to do

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:22.540
 is the people in the field if you can. So I know many people will ask

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:33.390
 their their dad "Hey dad should I join the Navy?" And I gotta say

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:44.230
 if your dad has never been in the Navy, then although his advice should

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:55.080
 be considered, he might not know what he's talking about. The best

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:05.930
 thing to do would be to ask someone who's been in the military, and

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:16.770
 the longer the time the better. So for instance, you don't want to

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:27.620
 ask your cousin Joe who just got back from boot camp what the military's

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:38.470
 like. He's probably not gonna give you a fully formed answer. You

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:49.310
 want to ask the senior chief who can give you from the outs and in,

00:01:49.310 --> 00:02:00.160
 the deployments, to the ward, to the sitting at home, to the long

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:11.000
 days, to the long nights, to the easy vacations and the full spectrum.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:21.850
 So get people with experience.
