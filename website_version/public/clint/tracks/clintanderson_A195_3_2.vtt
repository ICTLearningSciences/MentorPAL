00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.240
The most important lesson that I've learned about life, I don't know if

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.630
 it's true or not, but I say that you should follow your passion. That's

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.020
 what I'm doing myself. Hopefully I'll eventually reach that goal

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.410
 or at least you know fight the good fight or smiling until my death

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.790
 bed trying to follow my passion. I guess if I were following my passion

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.180
 then I would probably be in a nice paying job with a nice car

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.570
 and a nice house down the street in a nice cul de sac. But for some

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.960
 reason I feel like what I wanna do is, I want to own my own business

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.350
 one day, or I want to make some really outstanding computer science

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.740
 product. So because I'm doing that, it feels like my life is worth

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.130
 doing. Rather than me working for someone else, helping someone else

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.520
 make their dream come true, making the best Pepsi can in the world,

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.910
 or making the best table in the world, or making power for people

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.290
 of Orange County you know. All of those are are honorable professions,

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.680
 but it's something that I didn't come up with, it's not something

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.070
 that I wanted to do. So I'll try to do something I want to do and so

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.460
 far I'm glad that I'm doing it, so that's my suggestion for other

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.850
 people as well.
