00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.280
The military is a great opportunity for people of all different lifestyles.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.710
 If you find yourself poor or you don't really know what you're

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.140
 going to be doing, then the military is a great option. If you're poor

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.560
 then they're going to give you a salary that takes care of you from

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.990
 day one. You're never going to have to worry about housing. If you're

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.420
 financially responsible from that point on, you'll have a steady

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.850
 income. You'll have a place over your head. You'll know what job

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.280
 you're going to have the next year. You don't have to worry about being

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.710
 fired. If you weren't a good student in school, of course there's

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.140
 a limit that you have to be smart enough to join. You have to be able

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.560
 to pass the tests that it takes to get there. However, if college

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.990
 isn't in your future, and if you don't want to do a job that you feel

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.420
 is very very below your level, then the military can be a great

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.850
 option, because they have so many different jobs available to you that

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.280
 you don't need a college degree for. If you're interested in writing,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.710
 if you're interested in playing music, or even being an engineer,

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.140
 many of those jobs require some kind of advanced degree or some kind

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.560
 of specialized training. But the military, as long as you can pass

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.990
 the test and that's an option available to you, then you can take

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.420
 it. So people that don't know what they want to do, people that need

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.850
 some kind of financial security, people that even want to go to college,

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.280
 the military has great opportunities for you to further your

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.710
 education. Be it by getting your degree, by getting advanced certificates,

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.140
 by just having the vocational experience. For instance, if you

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.560
 want to join a job later on, you say, well I used to fix aircraft

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.990
 for the military. You don't even need a degree for that, they can say

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.420
 that experience is good enough to join this job. So people that want

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.850
 job expereince, military is a great option.
