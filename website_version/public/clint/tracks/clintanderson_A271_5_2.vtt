You are allowed to quit the military on very special occasions. For the

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.350
 most part, you're on contract. The contract could be anywhere from

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.100
 two years to four years, I think the maximum is six years. My contract

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.850
 was four years and then I did a two year extension. During that

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.600
 time if I wanted to stop the military, I didn't really have that choice.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.350
 There are ways you can get out if you do something bad or if you

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.100
 do something that's against the rules, also if you have a family emergency

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.850
 if you can present your case the right way, then you can ask

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.600
 the commanding officer who you know sends it up to the big Navy to

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.350
 try to get you either, give you temporary leave or full leave. But

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.100
 for the most part you have to stick with your contractÂ and it'sÂ generally

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.850
 four years.
