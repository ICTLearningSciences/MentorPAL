00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.660
When recruiters look for new people to come and join the navy, they're

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.470
 looking for special special ideology not a special skill set. You can

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.290
 come in with nothing. You can come in with your GED, you can come

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.100
 in with C's like I did from high school and they will train you, that's

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.910
 not a problem. The ideology that I'm talking about is the fact

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.730
 that you need to be able to follow instructions. So for instance if

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.540
 you always got in trouble all the time and you can't follow directions,

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.350
 then that is a hit. A lot of people that would have went to jail

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.160
 still join the military because the judge thinks that they have the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.970
 potential to follow directions if in the right situation. So the biggest

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.790
 quality that recruiters look for when they ask people to join

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.600
 the navy is "Will you do what I tell you to do? Will you do what your

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.410
 supervisor tells you to do? Are you going to be drunk and get kicked

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.230
 out of military right away?" If you sexually harass people then that's

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.040
 a big no-no. So someone who is moral, someone who follow directions,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.850
 that's what they're looking for.
