00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.250
The button, the infamous button. So, there is no such thing as a button.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.650
 There's a difference between the nuclear navy and the weaponized

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.050
 nuclear navy. If you're on a ballistic submarine, then they do have

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.450
 nuclear weapons on it and technically there is a button on that, that

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.850
 shoots off the weapons. I've never seen it. I didn't work on the subs,

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.250
 so I'm not one to talk about it but the ship that I was on, an

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.650
 aircraft carrier, there's no such thing. Nuclear technicians on an aircraft

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.050
 carrier, we just deal with making the ship go through the water,

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.450
 providing electricity, doing all of the things that a power generation

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.850
 station would do for a city. There is nothing to explode.
