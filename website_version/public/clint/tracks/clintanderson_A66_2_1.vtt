A chief wears this anchor right here. A Chief is basically the supervisor

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.760
 of the enlisted side of the operational portion of the ship. He's

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.210
 actually been in the Navy for a long time. Most Chiefs become Chiefs

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.670
 after about twelve years or maybe fourteen years. Some of the hot

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.120
 runners can become Chiefs after eight years but basically, no matter

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.580
 what, number one, they're really good at their job, number two, they

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.030
 have the support of the officers to make sure that they can take

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.490
 care of the plants themselves and number three, they have really good

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.940
 expertise and years in doing what they've been doing. So, they can

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.400
 be trusted to actually tell you what to do because they've done it

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.850
 so many times themselves.
