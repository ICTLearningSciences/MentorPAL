00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.580
Now that I'm not in active duty, I find that I'm still working pretty

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.320
 often, even though I'm not on the clock per se, I still have to bring

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.050
 my work home with me sometimes. So, for instance, in the US Navy Reserve,

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.780
 you're supposed to work two days per month, I'm sorry, two days

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.520
 per month and two weeks per year but I find that I'm working, sometimes

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.250
 Mondays, sometimes Wednesdays, sometimes Monday Tuesday Wednesday

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.980
 and Thursday, doing evaluations, making sure that we have some

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.720
 kind of lunch that we're supposed to go to, making sure that people

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.450
 have their correct physical training. So, it's not a nine to five job

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.180
 normally. When I was active duty and I wasn't on deployment and I

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.920
 was just stationed at my command, you still work many many cases during

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.650
 night time. So, as long as you just make sure that, you understand

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.380
 that that could happen, that your wife or your husband understands

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.120
 that situation, then, you realize that work is work and is what you

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.850
 have to do.
