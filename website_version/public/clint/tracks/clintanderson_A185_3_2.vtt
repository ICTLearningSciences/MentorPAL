00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.420
I think that there will be two major things that anybody who knows you

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.990
 would kind of think about you after you join the military. Number one

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.560
 is they'll give you a lot of respect. They know what the military

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.140
 does you know, everybody knows like how the military you know fights

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.710
 these wars and if they're Americans then they probably have, they

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.280
 give a lot of credit for risking your life for them. Number two they

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.850
 will probably be scared. They'd be scared for your life, especially

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.420
 if you're going to go fight a war, and they'd be scared for your safety,

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.990
 because the military has a lot of dangerous places outside of

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.560
 war. So respect for you and fear for you. If you can kind of manage

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.140
 those two, then you can kind of convince them hey you know like the

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.710
 military could be the right choice, and as much as you want my safety,

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.280
 you have to realize like the job I'm trying to do is for everybody's

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.850
 benefit.
