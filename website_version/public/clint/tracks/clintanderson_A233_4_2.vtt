00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.880
One of the biggest fears that I had joining college was that I wasn't

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.910
 good enough. When I started going to Berkeley, I just barely started

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.940
 computer science. So, I was a noob. I was just a very new person with

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.970
 computer science and during the orientation, there's is this guy

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.000
 that's, you know, kind of, explaining what the campus is like, what

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.030
 life is going to be like, what you can expect from the liberal campus

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:36.060
 and I was sitting in the computer science group and to my left and

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.090
 right were two of my newest friends. To my left, there was a Java programmer,

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.120
 he'd been programming for eight years, he was an expert in

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.150
 this field, he'd, you know, made several programs and, like, he explained

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.180
 all of this to me and I'm like, "Okay, we're going to be going

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.210
 to the same class, alright" and to my right, there was somebody very

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.240
 very similar. He was, like, accepted to Stanford and he went to

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.270
 Berkeley because it's cheaper but, he had been programming since he

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.300
 was twelve, when he made his first computer, you know, like, blah blah

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.330
 blah and I was like, "Okay, so this is the average people going to

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.370
 my university and we're going to be taking the, all right, I got some

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.400
 work for me to do." So, that was what was on my plate when I first

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.430
 started going. For the military, I would say that something similar

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.460
 was going, I felt was going to happen. I joined the nuclear technology

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.490
 side of the Electrician's mate course and I had never liked engineering

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.520
 things at all, at all. I was the opposite. I liked driving

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.550
 my car but if you told me to change my oil, I would say, "I don't think

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.580
 so. I'm going to take it in to Midas." I don't like grease, I didn't

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.610
 like screw drivers. The biggest accomplishment I'd done, as far

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.640
 as, like, mechanical type things was, I had put shingles on a house

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.670
 and yeah, I was outside and yeah, you know, the air smelled fine but

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.700
 those mechanical type jobs, I just didn't feel at that time was for

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.730
 me. So, that's one of the reasons I actually joined the nuclear side

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.760
 of the Electrician's Mate. It's because, I actually wanted to challenge

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.790
 myself in that. I wanted to, kind of, see what that side was

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.820
 like, so. But when I joined, I'm pretty sure everybody there had a

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.850
 big head start over me that I had to overcome.
