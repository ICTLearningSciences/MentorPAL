00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.780
There's not one right answer to the best STEM field to go into, I started

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.710
 off as an electrician for the Navy but I eventually changed to computer

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.640
 science because after thinking about it I thought you know with

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.560
 all the other engineering rates you actually need to invest some

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.490
 kind of money if you want to make a robot you need to go to Radio Shack

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.420
 and buy all those equipments, if you want to work on planes then

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.350
 eventually you're going to need to go find a plane to work on. But

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.280
 computer science for me was one of the only jobs that you can have

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.210
 where you can have a Macbook, you can open it up and based on just your

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.140
 own mind and this laptop you can come up with a million dollar product

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.060
 and that to me was incredible so that's why I switched but electrician

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.990
 is a great job I had sometimes I had fun with it and I can

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.920
 see that other people that I saw the mechanics the like electronics

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.850
 engineers they they engineers generally are pretty happy people.
