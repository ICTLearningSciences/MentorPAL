00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.430
The main beneficiary of the work that I do, I'd probably say, are the

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.020
 youth of today. I sound like an old geezer but yeah, if you're 12, if

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.600
 you're 15, hopefully some of the things that I'm thinking about, they're

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.180
 probably not going be done, you know next year or you know, three

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.770
 years from now. I'm trying to do things that are to take like five

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.350
 years, you know things that are like, for instance things with virtual

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.930
 reality where I want you to live inside that world, things, you

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.520
 know, for movies and they don't come so easily, you know, it takes

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.100
 years and years of work. So, by the time it reaches its fruition,

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.680
 maybe the kids, you know, that are in middle school right now will probably

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.270
 be in university and the, really witnessing the Marvel that

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.850
 I created. I think those are the main beneficiaries.
