00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.380
In my profession as an electrician I look up to a lot of people. At least

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.910
 in my work center of course I'm always going to be turning to the

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.440
 person right beside me, the senior chief or even the master chief

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.970
 of the command to kind of give me directions so that I can become a

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.500
 better chief myself. I expect them to tell me when I'm messing up. I expect

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.030
 them to kinda correct me in a lot of situations and to give

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.560
 me lots of advice. So, in my work center it's going to be the next person,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.090
 next enlisted person in front of me. However, as an electrician

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.610
 I also have a lot of respect for the academic side of the science.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.140
 So for instance when I read about things, read about nuclear technology

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.670
 things and the way they are improving from MIT or from Berkeley

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.200
 or from other places that, you know, promote nuclear technology then

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.730
 I'm really proud of them as well, and that's why I started becoming

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.260
 a university student myself because I want to follow in that direction.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.790
 I see our tech, our engineering field has a lot of room to expand

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.320
 and I want to be a part of that. So I look to people promoting

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.850
 engineering marvels.
