00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.400
The organizations most helpful to me number one has to be the military

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.940
 healthcare system so I think I hurt my thumb I also sprained my foot

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.490
 really bad and one thing that you don't really have to worry about

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.030
 being in the military is the top of this head to the bottom of your

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.580
 feet- it's all taken care of. You might have to pay a little bit more

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.120
 for your family but other than that the rates are really cheap and

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.670
 it's very convenient. Another thing that I think of, another association

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.210
 I think of when I think of the military that is actually on the

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.760
 fun level is MWR. Without MWR I would have a hugely different impression

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.300
 of the military but they throughout my whole entire career if

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.850
 I ever wanted to play pool, if I ever wanted to bowl, if I ever wanted

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.400
 to go hiking, skiing, camping, they were right there with super

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.940
 friendly people to make sure that our work outside of our hard military

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.490
 life is rewarded. And finally I have to give my credit to the USO.

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:09.030
 Whenever I go to an aircraft carrier they're the nicest sweetest

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.580
 people. They give me hot dogs, cakes, cookies, they provide me a place

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.120
 to sleep, they allow me to put my bags down, especially when I want

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.670
 to walk around the aircraft carrier without being over burdened.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.210
 I see other people out there waiting in these long lines, back up against

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.760
 the wall with the kids and then I see the USO people and their

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.300
 military families having the time of their lives even though it's

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.850
 a five hour flight. So hats off to USO.
