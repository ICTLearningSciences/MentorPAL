00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.520
When I was in college, I actually did a couple of internships and they

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.180
 really helped me out a lot. The very first one that I did was when

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.850
 I was in community college. It was right before I was accepted to my

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.520
 university. It was at the Naval Training Center in Orlando, Florida.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.180
 So, I was in the military before so that's probably a big reason why

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.850
 they accepted me for this internship but we were studying something,

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.520
 we were doing work on something called the MSAT. It's this big huge

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.180
 screen that Marines, kind of, like, sit in front of, with their

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.850
 guns, facing the screen and they're supposed to be talking to a helicopter

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.520
 and the helicopter is supposed to be dropping bombs on something.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.180
 So, if they didn't have this screen, they'd actually have to do

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.850
 it in real life. They'd actually have to be on the desert and talk

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.520
 to a real helicopter to tell them to drop bombs on this place and the

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.180
 helicopter costs money, the people in the helicopter and the pilots

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.850
 cost money. Being out there in the field, you know, it all costs money

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.520
 but if you're doing virtually, then you save so much cash. So that's

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.180
 one of the first things that I was doing. The internship was to

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.850
 look at the code and help write the script so that when the person

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.520
 talks to the computer, that it understands what he says. So, if he

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.180
 says, "Drop an illumination bomb on set XYZ in 300 yards. Explosion."

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.850
 Maybe the computer might not exactly understand what he said. Maybe

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.520
 the computer hears, ''Alarmination instead of illumination" and without

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.180
 that word, it wouldn't do the right thing. So, my goal was to

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.850
 say, "Well, hey, sometimes people say illumination, sometimes people

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.520
 say illumination, sometimes people say illumination but no matter what

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.180
 they say, as long as they say il-la, then the computer should understand

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.850
 the rest of what he's trying to say because there's only one

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.520
 type of bomb." So, that's, kind of, like, the first internship that

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.180
 I had. The next internship that I had was at the University of Southern

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.850
 California Institute for Creative Technologies where I was a quality

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.520
 assurance specialist. That's where I look at a game and I make

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.180
 sure that it's, all of the things are supposed to be working the right

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.850
 way, the sound works the right way, the colors work the right way,

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.520
 the listening of the computer works the right way and another internship

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.180
 that I had, it wasn't quite an internship but it was a job,

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.850
 as a Residential Computing Consultant for the University of California,

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.520
 Berkeley where I just go around, making sure that all the students

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.180
 had the right operating system, could get onto the wireless network

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.850
 and didn't have any viruses.
