00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.540
The person that influenced me the most, I would have to say is, probably

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.230
 Hermann Hesse. Hermann Hesse is an author from Germany who wrote

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.930
 a few books. He wrote Siddhartha, which is one of my favorite books.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.620
 Demian, which is another. If you've ever heard of Steppenwolf, he's

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.310
 the one who created that, you know, the band called Steppenwolf was

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.000
 named after one of his books and I've read most of his works. It taught

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.700
 me, well, his works taught me that, number one, there are really

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.390
 some bright people out there who are masters at their craft and I

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.080
 kind of got faith in humanity because of him. Now, I'm a STEM person

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.770
 and he is as humanities as you can get but despite that, I like the

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.470
 way that he presented what was on his mind through paper, to me. That's

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.160
 kind of the way that I try to make my code. I try to think, "Well

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.850
 someone's going to be looking at my code later. So I have to make

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.540
 it very very clear. Even though it's a complex thing that I'm writing,

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.230
 someone has to be able to, like, look at it without me talking to

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.930
 them physically and understand what it is that I'm trying to, that

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.620
 I'm trying to present." So, yeah it's a big jump to go from literature

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.310
 to computer science, you know, thinking of it the same way but he

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.000
 developed me mentally, based on the logic that his characters, you

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.700
 know, went through, like, I've had, like, difficult times in my life

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.390
 and I saw that his characters, even though, well this is 60-70 years

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.080
 ago, his characters went through some of the same things that I am

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.770
 going through. So, it's kind of, like, watching a really good well-written

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.470
 movie when I read his books. He's pretty much the only novelist

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.160
 that I read. So, Hermann Hesse would have to be someone that really

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.850
 inspired me.
