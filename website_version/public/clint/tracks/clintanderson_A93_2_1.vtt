00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.630
You might want to try to develop yourself into the best sailor that you

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.410
 can be, and when you do that, when you want to try to do that, that

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.180
 means that you have to take on jobs that aren't usually easy. So it

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.960
 all began when I joined the join the military. At first I had the

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.740
 opportunity to take normal jobs, slightly higher jobs, and in their

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.520
 most advanced field, nuclear technology. So that's what I chose to do.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.290
 I didn't take the easy route in that case and for me it worked out

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.070
 really well. As I became a nuclear technician then lots of jobs start

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.850
 popping up for you so again you have to decide well do I want to

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.630
 have an easy life, have a normal nine to five job. Do I want to go

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.410
 home at the end of the night or should I try this supervisory position

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.180
 that you hear that they have to stay on the ship later, they have

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.960
 more responsibly put on them, they're blamed a lot more for things.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.740
 So basically you have to make your life worse some people would say,

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.520
 but I think it's just more responsible. Just like with any job the

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.290
 more responsibility you take, the more risks you have of getting in

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.070
 trouble now because you're taking care of this work center your blamed

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.850
 for that work center if something goes wrong. However if you can

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.630
 do your good job and have that work center be better because of you.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.410
 You tell the people what to do and they have less of incidence of

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.180
 failure you bring your boss down there and say well this is the way

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.960
 it used to be but I told this person to do X, this person to do Y and

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.740
 now this person is better because of that. So now that supervisor

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.520
 that's in front of you will give you an award for that so the only way

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.290
 to progress yourself, to become a chief, senior chief, master chief,

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.070
 is to put yourself in that role to take on those risks of failure

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.850
 and ultimately reap the rewards.
