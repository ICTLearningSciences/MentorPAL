USO stands for the United Services Organization. I don't specifically

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.160
 know like why they were formed but I I know that a lot of people who

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.310
 are associated with the military before, maybe they're veterans themselves,

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:21.470
 maybe it's the wife of someone in the military, maybe it's

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.620
 someone who just has a lot of respect for the military. They come and

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.770
 they volunteer their time to show their respect to the military in

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.930
 lots of ways. The way that I know is that they're at airports and they

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.080
 have a little building off to the side or maybe they're on the second

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.230
 level of the airport where you can go in and you can rest, you

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.390
 can eat some of their food, you can have conversations with other people

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.540
 on similar flights, and it's really convenient. I'm sure that

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.700
 they do other things as well so I wanna give them credit for that but

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.850
 the way that I know them is from their support at the airports.
