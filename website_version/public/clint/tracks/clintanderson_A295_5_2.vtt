00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.400
For me, personally, because I'm such a senior individual, many days are

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.940
 pretty repetitive. A lot of the training I've seen so many times before,

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.490
 that's why I'm an expert. A lot of the manuals, I've read so

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.030
 many times before that's why I'm an expert and some things, I could

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.580
 quote by heart. So, there's not that much extra learning that I need

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.120
 to do but then again, that's why I'm a Chief. We're the people that

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.670
 you're supposed to go to. What I see in newer people that come, for

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.210
 instance, they've just been in for a year or maybe two years, during

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.760
 working hours, I see them having the book open, turning page by page,

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.300
 learning new material. If they have questions, they come to me,

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.850
 they ask, well, first classes or more senior people to them. For me,

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.400
 as a Chief, even though I've seen a lot of the things very often, there

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.940
 are things I do, for instance, I might go on my annual training.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.490
 When I go to a ship that I'd never seen before, or I go to a station

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:09.030
 that I've never been to before and they ask me new things, that's

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.580
 when I actually have to learn myself. So, there are about two weeks

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.120
 per year that I go to a ship and they say, "Hey, find the ground in

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.670
 this" and I haven't seen a ground or I haven't had to look for a ground

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.210
 in a couple of years. That's when I go to my civilian co-workers

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.760
 and ask them, "Hey, it's been a while since I've done this. Can you

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.300
 please give me some advice?" Or, I have to pick up a book myself.
