With any job it's incredibly important to have a good source of feedback

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.480
 for the jobs that you do. If you're in a position where like you

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.800
 supervisor doesn't give you the the feedback that you need, he doesn't

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.110
 show you the right way to do things. What the Navy is really good

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.430
 for is having multiple resources to go to. So of course if you have

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.740
 one chief above you and you're an enlisted person and he's not listening

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.060
 to you, then what they say is that you can go above him. It's

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.380
 not generally expected that you do that, but it is possible you know.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.690
 Everybody from the captain of the ship all the way down for the most

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.010
 part has an open door policy, which means that if something is on

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.320
 your mind you can come talk to them. Generally they like you to follow

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.640
 the hierarchy. So the first question that they are going to ask

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.960
 is "did you ask the person underneath me?" so beside you, if you have

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.270
 a problem with someone above you, you talk to the people to your left or

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.590
 right. Then you talk to the people, let's say it's a chief that

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.900
 you're complaining about, then you talk to another chief. And then,

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.220
 if neither of those listen, then maybe the senior chief or maybe

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.530
 the officer of the unit and onwards up. So if you have a problem your

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.850
 feedback, then there are lots of resources that you can go to.
