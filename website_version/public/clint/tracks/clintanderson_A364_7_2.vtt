00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.650
I think my biggest strength would have to be my ability to show others

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.450
 something that I know very well. So, for instance, when I was in the

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.250
 military, we would have to explain how the propulsion system works

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.050
 to people who had no idea about it, who were cooks, or journalists

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.850
 or media representatives. So they would come, have no idea about engineering,

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.650
 have no idea about what steam, is what electricity is, how

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.450
 it works. And by the end of that, my little tour, they had to kinda

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.250
 understand it, they had to have a board they'd run, they'd have to

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.050
 kinda explain what I told them. And for the most part everyone told

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.850
 me, you know what, I understand it now. Everyone said, wow, you know

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.650
 like, that's so interesting, have few questions, but I think that I

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.450
 got it.  No one came away confused. I think that's one of my strengths.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.250
 When I try to teach kids English, English I know really well, so

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.050
 I can explain like, simple concepts very very good. So education is

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.850
 my strength
