If you try your best or you follow the directions as good as you can,

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.140
 then you have my word, you have nothing to worry about. If something

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.780
 goes wrong, for instance, like, let's say that there's a piece of equipment

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.420
 that doesn't work the right way and you can't complete your

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.060
 mission, then, of course, they might say, "You know what, like, you

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.710
 should have done more preventive maintenance on it or you should have

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.350
 looked at it better", but no one's going to fault you for that. If

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.990
 for instance, something else goes wrong that you tried your best to

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.640
 complete and for some reason, it doesn't work out the way that you

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.280
 expect, then you might get talked to, you might get, you know, because

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.920
 the responsibility is there, someone has to blame someone and it

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.560
 could be you but you won't get punished for it, which is something

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.210
 that I'm very proud about for the Navy. They're not going to bash people

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.850
 for doing quality work.
