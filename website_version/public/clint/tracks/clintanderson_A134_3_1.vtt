00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.250
So even though I wasn't really a jock in high school, I actually had a

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:13.650
 lot of interesting activities. So I ran track and field and I was varsity

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.050
 material, unfortunately I sprained my ankle during my junior

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.450
 year so that ended my college aspirations. But I also ran cross country

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:32.850
 you know, cross country first you know running three miles at our

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.250
 meets and then track and field in the spring, where you run fast.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.650
 I also tried my hand at other things like I guess wrestling for a day

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:52.050
 or two, basketball I tried and I didn't get accepted but also I was

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.450
 involved in things like SADD, Students Against Drunk Driving, Amnesty

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:04.850
 International, and a cornucopia of other things.
