00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.180
Everyone in the military that is on a ship will be deployed at sometime.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.520
 So our schedule is we do one and a half years on the shore, and then

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.850
 we do six months at sea. We do that twice and after that time, after

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.180
 that four year period, then you're scheduled to go work on a short

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.520
 command, and that should be anywhere from two to three years. So

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.850
 it depends on whether we're at war or not, whether the up tempo is

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.180
 really high or not, whether the ship that you're on has been out to

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.520
 sea a lot, but that's generally, the two year, the two year ship shore

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.850
 schedule is generally what it is.
