00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.350
So, I'm particularly fond of the military. I joined when I was 21 and

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.850
 I didn't really have that many skills available to me. I graduated high

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.350
 school and I wasn't the best high school grad, you know, many people

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.850
 in the military aren't and I tried college for a while and I was

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.350
 very, an on and off again student. I got a few Fs when I was there

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.850
 and because I was working two jobs at the time and you know, my days

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.350
 were pretty full. So, the military actually allowed me to have a semi-regular

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.850
 life, you know, like a semi-regular life. Because I was

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.350
 taking care myself, because I didn't have the support of my family,

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.850
 the military welcomed me with a job, a place to stay, some cash in my

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.350
 pocket, a skill set and that pretty much, once I got that grounding,

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.850
 then I was able to be very independent, very self sustaining for

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.350
 a long time. So, it's kind of, it took care of me in that way. So, do

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.850
 I love the military? You could say that I do. You know, it's the thing

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.350
 that allowed me to have a college education later on, it's the

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.850
 thing that allowed me to save up so much money and I think I'm doing

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.350
 pretty well for someone my age, so. As far as my job, my job as an

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.850
 Electrician's Mate, I didn't, it's not the job that I really wanted

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.350
 to do at the beginning. I wanted to learn languages and you know, travel

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.850
 the world a lot and I'm a nuclear technician. We weren't really

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.350
 allowed to do that because you're a nuke, you have to stay on the continental

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.850
 United States, So, I couldn't visit, I couldn't be stationed

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.350
 in Germany, I couldn't be stationed in France, which, you know,

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.850
 really, was irritating for me. And, I wasn't a very good engineer. I

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.350
 didn't have the engineering mindset when I joined the military at first.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.850
 However, I grew to love my job because the training that they

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.350
 give you, they make you a real expert at it. So, once you find a job

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.850
 that you can do, you start doing well and then you start getting awards,

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.350
 you start learning more things on your own and eventually I said,

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.850
 "You know what? Electrician's Mate is really cool. It's one of the

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.350
 best jobs that you can have in the military. So, I think it's, my

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.850
 love for the Navy comes from all of that combined.
