00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.110
So everybody joins the military as an E1 in boot camp, regardless of your

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.370
 rate. So once you join the military you get some kinds of incentives

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.620
 to join, so being a nuclear technician we're allowed to become

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.880
 E3s immediately. But in boot camp everyone's E1. So as soon as boot

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.140
 camp ended, then I was promoted to a fireman, which is the the engineering

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.400
 side of E3 right, and I did that for school, I was in school

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.660
 for six months, and by the time I graduated that school after six months,

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.910
 I was promoted to a first class petty officer, which is E4. Then

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.170
 I was, I went to nuclear power school, and then prototype training.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.430
 They're both six months and six months, then I went to my first ship.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.690
 Now when I finally got to my first ship, that's when I had been

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.950
 in for two years and also because of my rate, nuclear technician, they

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.200
 offered us to automatically be promoted to second class petty officer,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.460
 that's E5. And that's what I did, they offered us some cash,

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.720
 I got forty thousand dollars in cash, and it was tax free because we

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.980
 were fighting the war and I got automatically promoted to E5. So up

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.240
 until that time that for the first two years I'd always been automatically

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.500
 promoted either by school or just by joining, or just by signing

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.750
 a contract for an additional two years. That automatic promotion

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.010
 to E5 was because I extended my contract from six years to eight years.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.270
 After that time, after that two years, then I was, I got promoted

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.530
 four years later to E6. So I was promoted E5 in 2002 promoted E6

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.790
 in 2006, and then I guess I spent two more years in the military, and

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.040
 then I got out after eight years as an E6, which is first class petty

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.300
 officer. Then I made chief, which is what I am now, E7 in 2010,

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.560
 so that's four more years after. So again the time line is I joined

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.820
 boot camp, that's E1, after boot camp, which is about three months,

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.080
 then I was E3, a year and a half later I was, I'm sorry six months

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.330
 later I was E4, at my two year point I was an E5, and then four years

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.590
 later I was an E6, and four more years after that I was E7, chief.
