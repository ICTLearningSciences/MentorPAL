00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.920
Being in the Navy means you're going to be pretty much on a submarine

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.980
 or an aircraft or a destroyer or something similar to that where there

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.050
 aren't that many enemies in the local area. In fact, they say that

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:21.120
 during wartime, being on one of those Navy vessels is one of the safest

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.180
 places that you can be. So I haven't really seen or been up close

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.250
 and personal to enemies. What we do is we support. We support the

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.320
 army people and the marines that are on the land who do shoot people,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.380
 who are faced with combat situations. However, in the military we

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.450
 can do something special, we can actually join those people, and join

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.520
 their unit, join their brigade, or whatever you call it that actually

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.580
 go fight. That's not technically our job, Seals do that yes, and

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.650
 special forces also do that, but the vast majority of the people

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.720
 in the Navy are there in a support type of role to put the ship in a

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.780
 really safe spot so that the officers can fly their jets and their

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.850
 helicopters to go fight the war.
