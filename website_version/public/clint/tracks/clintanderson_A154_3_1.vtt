00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.520
I've stayed in a lot of different places since I've been in the military.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.180
 One was Charleston, South Carolina, then I moved up to Albany, New

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.850
 York, then I moved down across the country to San Diego. Then I moved

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.520
 up from there to Birmington, Washington. Now they all had a different

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.180
 flavor. One was a really good climate with lots of people, that's

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.850
 San Diego. Birmington was kind of more to the countryside, but

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.520
 you can have bigger houses and you can do hiking and skiing you know

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.180
  but it got pretty cold and rainy. New York was close to New York City,

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.850
 but Albany is lots of green trees everywhere you know. The houses

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.520
 are really big, but nothing was around that area. There was no building

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.180
 more than like five stories high you know, that's Albany for

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.850
 you so it's a very quiet town. And in Charleston, South Carolina I guess

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.520
 it's kind of like old style, and more south. So out of all those

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.180
 places that I've been since I've been in the military, I'm a California

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.850
 person, so I gotta do the San Diego thing.
