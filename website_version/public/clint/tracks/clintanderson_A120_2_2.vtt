00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.760
Trying to find what you love to do, it has two brought answers for me.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.670
 The first of which is you hear this very often, follow your passion.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.580
 So personally my passion was music and art. I wasn't an engineer person

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.490
 per se, when I was a kid all the way up until a couple years after

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.400
 I joined the navy. That's right, I joined as an engineer and I

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.300
 wasn't an engineer until after I got to my first ship. I, to tell you

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.210
 the truth, I didn't even like it too much. I like talking languages,

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.120
 and you know conversing with people, and you know writing stuff,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.030
 and typing on the computer. I did not want to see oil, I did not want

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.940
 to touch a wrench you know, that wasn't for me, but in the end, it

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.850
 brings me to my second point. Try to become really good at the skills

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.760
 that you possess. So for me, I think I'm a good electrician. I became

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.670
 a supervisor after some time, and it's not because I had a passion

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.580
 for electrician things, it's because I found that I was good at

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.490
 it, and that gave me motivation to learn more and more about it, and

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.400
 once I started doing that then it became easy for me. And after it

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.300
 becomes easy for you, then you can start explaining things really well,

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.210
 you can start reading a book and learning more about it really well,

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.120
 you start getting awards for it, you start you know wanting to

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.030
 know more about it. So yeah those two things: follow your passion and

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.940
 if that's not for you, then follow the skills that are provided to

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.850
 you.
