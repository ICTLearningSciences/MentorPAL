00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.140
When you're transferring to civilian life, it really depends on what type

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.420
 of job you had when you were in the military service. So I was an

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.710
 Electrician's Mate, which means that the word electrician is a part

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.990
 of lots of jobs out there, so it shouldn't be too difficult to find

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.280
 a job that kind of fits my job on the ship. I was also a nuclear technician

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.560
 and obviously there are much fewer jobs out there for that,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.850
 but they can be found. So every job in the military has a basic breakdown

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.140
 of all the things that they performed in very general categories.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.420
 So some are more transferable than others. If you worked on nuclear

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.710
 weapons then chances are there aren't that many jobs for you.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.990
 Comparatively there aren't that many jobs out there. However, if you're

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.280
 a cook let's say, then you know every city, every town, every shop,

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.560
 every place that that has shops for cooks has a job that you can

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.850
 apply for. So it really depends on the type of job that you get.
