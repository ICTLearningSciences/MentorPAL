00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.290
So just like the name says STEM, science technology engineering and math,

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.740
 your math classes and your science classes are the best indicators

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.180
 of whether you fit in. You might not be using the math, for instance

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.630
 calculus all the time, and you might not be using the complex calculus

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.070
 or the science that you see in your job. However there's a logic

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.520
 that's associated with it. There's a logic between doing the homework

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.960
 assignment seeing the question, knowing the answer, having seen

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.410
 the way to solve the problem before, and you have this new question

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.850
 and you have to like solve it a certain way. So that is very very

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.290
 general. I just mention the math problem to you, but programming has

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.740
 the same thing, trying to figure out a new mechanical solution to a

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.180
 mechanical problem has the same line of thinking. So it's not just

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.630
 numbers, but it's the way that you solve problems, and if you got As,

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.070
 maybe even Bs in those classes, then you might be interested in STEM

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.520
 classes later, or STEM jobs later. If you are just so so in those

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.960
 classes, I would suggest that you try to take them over again, you

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.410
 do some personal learning on your own, and if you just isn't clicking

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.850
 with you then STEM might not be the best option for you.
