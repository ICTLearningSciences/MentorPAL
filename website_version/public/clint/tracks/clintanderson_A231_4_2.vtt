00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.750
Currently, I have two different career paths that I'm going on. One is

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.650
 my Navy Reserve career and the other one is my computer science career.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.550
 In the Navy Reserve, I'm an Electrician's Mate Chief. I've been

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.450
 in for 17 years, 16 going on 17 years and I became a Chief, which is

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.350
 pretty high level, it an E7, out of E9 total. Those are the career

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.250
 steps, so, E1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and I am an E7. It took ten years to get

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.150
 there and I've been a Chief for the last six years. So, to become

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.050
 a Chief, it requires a lot of hard work and dedication and being an

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.950
 expert at your job, that's, you know, the title of what we're supposed

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.850
 to be. We're supposed to be able to show our junior sailors how

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.750
 to do things because we've done it so much ourselves. So, to get to

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.650
 that point, it took a lot of watch standing, it took a lot of drills,

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.550
 it took a lot of marching around, it took a lot of reading books,

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.450
 it took a lot of opening up, you know, presentations and information

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.350
 sheets about my job, during times that I didn't have to. I think that's

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.250
 the difference between a lot of Chiefs who make it and some people

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.150
 who don't, what you do on your free time. If you really care about

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.050
 your career, then, during your free time, you're not just going to

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.950
 watch DVDs and watch movies and play cards and just go on drums. You're

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.850
 actually going to spend some time trying to be advanced to the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.750
 next grade, to the next promotion level. As far as my civilian career,

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.650
 that's me being a master's student at the University of Southern

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.550
 California, it took a whole lot even more, even more than the military,

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.450
 it took a lot more dedication, homework, assignments, test preparation.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.350
 On my free time, I would spend so much time just staying up

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.250
 all night, just doing these homework assignments. Even after the test

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.150
 was over, I'd still open the book and, kind of like, get those questions

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.050
 that I didn't understand on the test, I would get those questions

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.950
 again to review, to try to understand what it is, what the class

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.850
 was trying to explain. So, this is math questions, science questions,

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.750
 even English questions. I would present an English assignment and

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.650
 then I get it back and, you know, "These are all the mistakes that

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.550
 you made." So, I'd open up my Central Texas College, you know, handbook

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.450
 and I'd say, "Oh, there should have be a quotation there, there

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.350
 should have been a semicolon there", so, even simple things like that.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.250
 And all of this is in order to become an expert at whatever it

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.150
 is I'm learning. So, as long as you make sure that you have that final

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.050
 goal in mind, which is to be an expert at whatever it is that you're

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.950
 doing, then you'll become a high level, you'll wind up at USC at

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.850
 a master's course or you'll be a Chief or higher in the military.
