00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.000
Something that's really important in life, although I don't really have

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.160
 it in abundance myself. It's your connection with other people, be

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.310
 it your family, be it your close friends, be it your coworkers. You

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:21.470
 should really try to put yourself out there in the world, try to become

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.620
 you know a part of this world. I know that sounds very theoretical,

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.770
 but like if you're living in isolation, yes you're playing your

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.930
 video games, yes your studying all day and all night, and if you don't

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.080
 have that much interaction with other people in real life, then

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.230
 I think that you're missing out on something that is a really really

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.390
 really critical to make this world go round you know. I think you'd

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.540
 find yourself smiling a lot more every day and finding a better peace

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.700
 when you don't have any enemies around you, when you are looking

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.850
 out for your brothers and your sisters beside you.
