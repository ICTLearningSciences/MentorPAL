00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.400
Sexual harassment is a really big topic for the US military. I won't lie

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.950
 it is very very apparent. It's common throughout the whole entire

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.500
 time that I've been in the military. People don't generally take it

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.050
 too far. There's lots of training that we have, we have it all the

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.600
 time throughout every single year about don't touch people, don't say

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.150
 certain words, don't post certain pictures. However, when you get

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.700
 this many young people, in their twenties, young twenties, around each

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.250
 other, they're college level, they're college style people, then

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.800
 with this type of young personality, it's gonna pop up. It's going to

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.350
 show up. Even though they know that they're not supposed to. You can

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.900
 see it in the bars that we go to, they kind of forget that they're

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.450
 still in the military. So outside of working hours you can see them

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.000
 kind of drinking and kinda you know hugging each other, like touching

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.550
 each other inappropriately, that happens a lot. However, whether

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.100
 it's guys and guys, girls and girls, guys and girls together, generally

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.650
 because we all work together, we're all friends, we don't want

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.200
 to see each other get in trouble. We take it for what it is. If it gets

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.750
 out of hand then you know it does show up, and I have seen people

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.300
 get in trouble big time for this. But for the most part even though

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.850
 it's there, it's very very limited, and I think it's manageable.
