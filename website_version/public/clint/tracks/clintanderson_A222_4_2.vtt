00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.640
An experience that illuminates Navy culture, you can find them in many

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.420
 movies. We have these things called 'port calls', where you have people,

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.210
 maybe in their dress blues, which is like the nice uniform that

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.990
 we have with the white sailor hat, you know, flipped to one side,

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.780
 should be straight but, walking around a foreign port, you know, with

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.560
 girls, kind of yelling, like, "Hey, come over here!" and you know,

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.350
 you go there and drink beers and they are in many movies, Full Metal

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.140
 Jacket and it can be guys and girls obviously, but in many movies,

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.920
 you can kind of see that situation happen. The bar going sailor and

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.710
 I think that pretty much is a fact. That is true. When you're in the

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.490
 Navy, that you're going to have those experiences all the time and

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.280
 those are going to be the checkmarks, the cool parts of your naval

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.060
 career, going to port calls. So, just watch a movie and you'll see it.
