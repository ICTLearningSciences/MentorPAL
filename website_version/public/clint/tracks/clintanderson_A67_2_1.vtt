00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.410
So, we have this term, it's 'in port'. 'In port' means that you're stationed,

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.960
 you're not stationed you're actually at another country's, kind

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.520
 of, naval base. It might not actually be a naval base. It's a place

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.070
 that can hold ships. So, when you're on deployment, let's say, you're

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.630
 in the middle of the ocean, you're there for a month or two months.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.180
 Then you finally want to, you know, put your feet on land, so

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.740
 you could probably stop in Hong Kong or Singapore, wherever they can

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.290
 hold a ship that's safe for a United States naval vessel. You can pull

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.850
 in and then, that's a new country for you. That's 'in port'.
