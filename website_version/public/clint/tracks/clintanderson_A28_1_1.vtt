00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.560
So, your paycheck is one of the biggest things that people really love

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.280
 about working for the military. Right now, I'm a Chief, so I make about

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.990
 $4500 per month. Well, I don't make it, I am in the US Navy Reserve

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.710
 but usually on active duty, Chiefs make $4500 per month and they

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.420
 also have this thing called BAH, Basic Allowance for Housing which

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.140
 almost doubles your paycheck. So, you get about like $2500 per month

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.850
 and if you add that up it's about $75000 per year.
