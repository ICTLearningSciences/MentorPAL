00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.650
The person that gave me the best advice about joining the military I'd

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.450
 have to say would be my father. He was in the army and although I never

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.250
 saw him while he was at work, well just barely, it was as a kid

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.050
 you know, I sit in the corner playing video games or something with

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.850
 my gameboy. But he did tell me you know, when he came home what his day

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.650
 was like. He'd say some of the things about the work they have

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.450
 to do, the PT that he had to do, the people he had to supervise. I also

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.250
 saw the type of life that we lived in. I know that like it was a very

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.050
 nice clean environment, he showed me his corvette outside and

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.850
 we took it for a spin a few times. We would always be going on vacations,

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.650
 and he'd tell me like these are the benefits that are associated

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.450
 with the military, any he'd develop my pride and my motivation to

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.250
 join later on you know. If he wouldn't have been in the army, maybe

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.050
 who's to say that I would have joined myself, but military families

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.850
 have a high rate of convincing other people around them to join.
