00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.530
I had so many good experiences in the navy there are so many things we

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.220
 did were fine and exciting and and when I look back on them I I just

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.900
 can't imagine that I got to participate in that I got to fire weapons

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.590
 I've never have a chance to fire before I fired several thousand

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.270
 rounds through an M. sixty machine gun at how many people get to say

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.960
 they got to do that I was blessed in a lot of ways but never have

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.640
 you fired a human being so I don't have the kind of moral issues a lot

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.320
 of guys but back with them shot and killed people I did that was

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.010
 fun it was fun when we were down at homestead Air Force base when we

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.690
 designed and ran our very own he survey of how the people on that base

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.380
 we're being treated by their organization to how the navy was doing

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.060
 by the cryptologist that was fun at was fun thing to do and got

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.740
 us a good reputation actually when we got ready to leave the base we

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.430
 were accused of not being reservist being some kind of sneaky people

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.110
 from the management group were just pretending to be your service

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.800
 so they could come to the service so so that that was fun I've been

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.480
 on all kinds of ships I've been all kinds of aircraft I've been in helicopter

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.170
 rides it would take me a lifetime because the fun I've had
