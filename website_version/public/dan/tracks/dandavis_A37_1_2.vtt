00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.680
From the time I enlisted in the marine corps in 1967 until I retired in

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.520
 2003 from the navy reserve, I would say I flew someplace in the nation

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.350
 or overseas twice to three times every year. So there's quite a

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.180
 bit of travel involved in it. I like travel so that was a good thing,

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.020
 but there are other jobs it didn't travel quite as much as I did,

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.850
 and some jobs of course where you're flying all the time
