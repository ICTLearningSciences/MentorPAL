00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.540
it seems like in America today studies have shown that the vast majority

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.230
 of us suffer from some degree of self doubt and sometimes this is

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.930
 manifest in a way that people can tell that the person is lacking in

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.620
 self confidence or have self doubt sometimes it's masked by exaggerating

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.310
 your sense of eagle insufficient since sufficiency in trying

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.000
 to override the self doubt you're feeling inside but in any case when

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.700
 you start to feel self doubt I think the best thing you can do is

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.390
 always refer back it's what I do anyways refer back two people with

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.080
 whom you're working knowing that you're part of a team you have an obligation

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.770
 to support them and carry your own load but they have an obligation

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.470
 to support you as well so when you feeling self doubt just

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.160
 think about grief at the team and how many people are there to to back

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.850
 you up in call for on them for help if you need it
