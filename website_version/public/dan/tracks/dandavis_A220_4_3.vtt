00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.270
I had decades of experience in marine corps in the navy and industry and

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.690
 academia leadership has always been their primary topic of discussion

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.110
 and all those fields and there's always a lack of leadership is

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.530
 to cried and the presence of leadership leads to success so the question

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.960
 is what constitutes good leadership and that's almost impossible

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.380
 to answer the one inside I have had to use people are frequently

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.800
 the worst leaders when they try to emulate someone else's leadership

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.220
 style if you are a hard charger in the person who enjoys confrontation

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.640
 and forcing people to do their job that's one leadership style but

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.060
 if you're an easy going person who is Morrie leader who facilitates

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.480
 the people under him getting the job done and tries to motivate him

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.900
 to want to do it on their own that's a different kind leader if you

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.320
 look back at World War two and you know a thing about military history

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.740
 Omar Bradley and George Patton were two completely different leaders

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.170
 and they couldn't of been a leader in the morals of the other

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.590
 with because they just were not set up to do that yet they were wonderful

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.010
 leaders in their own right so find your own style while the people

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.430
 under you take care of the people who were in charge of you and

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.850
 you can't go far wrong
