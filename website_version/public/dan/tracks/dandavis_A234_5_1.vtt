00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.270
if there's some options that are open to you about studying I think there

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.690
 are number factors you should look at if you're straight out of

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.110
 high school I think the first factor is you need to do a very realistic

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.530
 evaluation and have some other people help you evaluating from the

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.960
 other side outside of yourself about how mature you are and how ready

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.380
 you are for what kind of university or college setting a lot of

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.800
 people I know and I was probably one of them with them did much better

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.220
 advised to have Pagel read to my folks and stayed home for my first

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.640
 two years of college and gone to a local junior college in California

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.060
 at least the junior colleges are set up to be feeders in the state

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.480
 college system so they have very rigorous courses basic introductory

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.900
 courses you can take very cheap very convenient a lot better than

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.320
 going off and I just I think I need some guidance I tried going

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.740
 to college on my own for the first two years there really was a disaster

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.170
 set me back home ways and had to make up for it later that I should

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.590
 have had the other thing you do you think about is what are you

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.010
 a big institution person or small it's you did you really enjoy being

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.430
 with big crowds are you like a small setting and then look for a

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.850
 college that offers whatever fits you best
