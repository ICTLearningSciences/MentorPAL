00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.580
the reading of history indicates that alcohol has been an issue with military

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.300
 people since time immemorial and it is still a problem today

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.030
 to some degree but it is the eve important part of the military experience

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.760
 in my own take on of the history of of the military and it is

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.490
 surprising to me that even though the people I knew in the military

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.210
 drank proficiency amounts of liquor and beer and wine when they got

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.940
 all the military went back to family life of very few of them had

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.670
 any problems with alcohol so the word alcoholics per se but they resist

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.400
 used to drinking a lot in the military so I think is there no more

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.120
 problems with drink in the military than there are civilian life
