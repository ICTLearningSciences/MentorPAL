well I guess that for purposes of this discussion if I was trying to define

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:12.600
 myself I would say I am a videotape avatar representing experience

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.470
 in both the navy and in computer research in an attempt to convey

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.350
 some of the aspects of those careers to a young person trying to

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:30.230
 make a choice so you could consider me an avatar although purist would

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.100
 say I'm not an avatar never towards completely imaginary quasi human

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.970
 representation resign to somewhere real and Ben Davis but but at

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.850
 least as far as you experience me I'm an avatar
