00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.030
there's an old saying in the navy that if you've never been court martialed

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.210
 for trying something that you should have tried are you not doing

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.400
 your job very well because everything you do should be right on

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.580
 the ragged edge of of what's while so in most distilled work I have

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.760
 done that we've been doing research we have been doing product development

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.940
 or delivery kinds of but doing research so a lot of what you

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.120
 do is going to fail in a lot of it involves something in the failure

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.300
 might be bad enough to be called a blunder that as long as you've done

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.490
 it in good faith and you haven't tried to cover up the mistakes

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.670
 and you learn from the mistakes most professionals will accept you as

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.850
