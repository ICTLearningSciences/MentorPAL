00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.070
What people do after the get off active duty depends on the experiences

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.290
 they had when they were on active duty. Some people, at least temporarily,

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.520
 are so bitter about it that they don't want anything to do

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.740
 with the service and want to get as far away from it as they can, and

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.960
 what they try to do is find a complete new way of life. People who

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.180
 enjoyed it or stayed with it all the whole time that they finally retired

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.410
 from it, frequently go into duty that has something that's related

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.630
 back to their military service. In my case I wound up doing military

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.850
 simulation work for all the universities I worked with
