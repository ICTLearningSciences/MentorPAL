00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.730
unfortunately when you talk about stem activities in the military mine

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.600
 were very highly classified and I have not been informed that either

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.470
 work I did has been unclassified I had the wonderful work story that

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.350
 you would really enjoy about something we did in Vietnam but it was

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.230
 highly classified and I think remains classified to this day so I

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.100
 can't tell you that story so we go to my civilian life and see high

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.970
 performance computing research I was at the Caltech center for advanced

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.850
 computing research CCR when we were doing advanced computing research

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.730
 in high performance computing and I was there when we acquired

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.600
 the Intel paragon drool please see until delta so I was part of the

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.470
 team that both work on the Intel delta which is one of the first massive

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.350
 parallel computers and was there when we put the paragon so I

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.230
 guess I'm very very proud of that work in the field of stem there's

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.100
 you know Caltech is at the very top people who find out that you either

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.970
 went to school they are taught there or work here as a researcher

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.850
 that's that's gonna be the top your career right there
