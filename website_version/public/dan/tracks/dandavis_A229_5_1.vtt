others may define successes as having achieved a goal or make money or

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.400
 becoming famous or the like I more often think of my own personal success

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.670
 in terms of here's a person who needed help here's a person who

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.940
 was feeling down here's a person who needed me to be their friend

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.210
 and I was able to do that for them and they were better for that because

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.490
 of who I was those always been my greatest successes I will have

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.760
 to admit to you that one of my proudest days since the day I graduated

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.030
 from marine corps boot camp because that was difficult for me

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.300
 it was challenging for all of us we all made it few exceptions we lost

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.580
 a couple guys on the way but the rest of us made it and went on to

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.850
 careers in the marine corps
