00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.060
this is very interested in technical matters and has been since the days

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.270
 of sale navy officers who generally regarded by the public is being

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:16.470
 some of the most intelligent military officers because of the great

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.680
 skills they have to know to do celestial navigation sail a ship runny

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.890
 steamship run a nuclear powered submarine and all the electronics

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.100
 that go with all the work we do these days US so there isn't desire

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.310
 to get an advanced degree and an opportunity arose during World War

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.520
 two that required some training for officers and they picked up a

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.730
 school in Monterey California by buying an old bankrupt luxury resort

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.930
 hotel in Monterey and training turning it into a training school

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.140
 for navy officers after the war they decided to keep the school going

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.350
 but to make it a post graduate school largely for ROTC graduates and

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.560
 Naval Academy graduates who now needed advanced training in their

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.770
 field BET engineering or science or operations research or management

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.970
 and so they've created the naval postgraduate school is turned out

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.180
 to be a most excellent graduate school and is still in operation today

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.390
 where mid grade officers that he is only three you know for captains

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.600
 and majors in the army marine corps and yeah airforce or lieutenants

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.810
 in lieutenant commanders in the navy and Coast Guard where people

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.020
 at that level can go and get a master's degree at the navy base

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.230
 usually over period two years where all of their time goes to studying

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.430
 their masters were in preparing their research to justify what they're

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.640
 doing it in PS also grants P. H. D.'s to a very few students

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.850
 but they do have PhD programs
