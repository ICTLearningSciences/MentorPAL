No of course there is things in life that get kind of exaggerated and

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.350
 people who aren't in the field just don't really get a good feel what

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.100
 it's like. It's hard to say about the military, but I think one thing

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.850
 that gets romantisized is if you love the way people look in uniform.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.600
 You look at the recruiting posters and they're the guys in there

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.350
 dress blue you know bell bottoms sailor uniform looking very athletic

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.100
 and and romantic in their Old World style. You get the wind listed

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.850
 in the officers in their dress uniforms you know just looking like

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.600
 a million dollars. They don't very often have too many posters showing

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.350
 your your work uniform So the entire life is not spent yeah you

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.100
 know where you dress uniform and going to parties. A chaplain told

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.850
 me once it almost every incident puts in for embassy duty when gets

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.600
 commission you don't get embassy duty until you're at the other end

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.350
 of your career, a commander or a captain and so that that could be

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.100
 overly romanticize. How you can travel the world and become an embassy

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.850
 aid or something like that doesn't happened very much. But by and

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.600
 large, people understand. I think it's more the other way around what

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.350
 a high school kids think that everybody in the army runs around shooting

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.100
 people time. That you really you don't have that kind of pressure

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.850
 on you very often.
