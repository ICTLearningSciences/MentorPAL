due to the dangers involved in the importance of the mission that the

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.950
 navy a marine corps in the rest of military all very rule orient and

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.000
 sometimes you have to look at the rule and save even if it's a stupid

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.050
 rule no it's not a bad rule even though it's not the best rule so

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.100
 I'm gonna following just pick so breaking the rules he's never okay

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.150

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.200
 done and you have to break rules to do there been times when I

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.250
 in the navy what install equipment from somebody else in the navy because

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.300

 have never made command but I didn't get caught so make command so

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.450
 sometimes that's true sometimes breaking the rules is came for unit

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.500
 cohesiveness if you discharge from the military everybody who had broken
