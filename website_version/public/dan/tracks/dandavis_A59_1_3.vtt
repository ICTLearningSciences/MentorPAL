The military is always looking for people who speak other languages and

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.410
 they will train you if you don't know the language they need you know.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.180
 When I got done with Morse code training in Pensacola after my

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.960
 first year in the marine corps they sent me to Washington DC for an

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.740
 entire year to learn Vietnamese. A lot of people get that obligation

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.520
 and opportunity. I enjoyed the training and was trained in Vietnamese.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.290
 I was trained as a christological linguist not an interpretor or

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.070
 an interrogator so that's a little different duty, but there those

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.850
 are the two languages that I was certified to speak by the marine corps

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.630
 air. In high school I learned a little French and in college I learned

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.410
 little German. And now at my age by German and French are still

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.180
 much better because of so comparable to English. English being made

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.960
 up of Anglo Saxon and and French words, that it's just makes sense

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.740
 to me. Vietnamese is a total Asian language and because it was so

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.520
 strange to me. I was good at what I was doing that but as soon as I

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.290
 quit doing it it went away from me very fast. The only thing I can do

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.070
 now is very very basic conversational Vietnamese hello goodbye 1,2,3,

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.850
 kinds of things.
