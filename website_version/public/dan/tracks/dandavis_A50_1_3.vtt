Like everything else in life the navy gives you a lot but it demands of

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.000
 you a lot, and that's true about the marine corps probably even more

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.080
 so. And what other things that that both the corps and the navy demand

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.160
 of you is separation from the ones you love. If you're married

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.230
 or if you have a family of any kind to whom you are responsible, you'll

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.310
 be obligated to spend time away from there's no doubt about that.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.390
 It's nothing like it was in days of yore historically speaking of

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.470
 a male Whaler in Boston in the early eighteen century would leave Boston

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.540
 and be gone for two or three years was no communication back to

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.620
 his wife children parents as to whether he was even still alive or

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.700
 not and then which show back up and be around for a few months than

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.770
 them gone again. Nothing like that, but you do have to endure a significant

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.850
 separation from family and friends
