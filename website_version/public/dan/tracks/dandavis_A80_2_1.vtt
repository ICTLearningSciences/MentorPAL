00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.530
looking at like two careers workday change significantly as I got more

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.210
 and more senior well let's start off with the military career I started

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.900
 out as a junior listed mail order everything I was doing was being

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.580
 somebody else told me he should go here go there to be there then

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.260
 do this and just so I just had to follow orders get about and the

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.940
 first two years of my time in the marine corps were spent in schools

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.620
 one kind or another so it's mainly just studying and eating and enjoying

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.300
 life my year in Vietnam I was on watch standing which means for

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.990
 eight hours every day of the week seven days a week I wasn't doing

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.670
 my linguistic duties and that was a different way to get through life

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.350
 when I got into the reserves in the military I start out again as

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.030
 a mid level in the person basically just taking training a life but

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.710
 then as I became an officer of the keyboard more someone who had organized

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.400
 and more Morgan who someone who had a right so I spent a lot

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.080
 of my time writing up players ready valuations writing up proposals

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.760
 training and getting ready for inspections and so my day buried as

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.440
 I got more and more senior to appoint right got where it was just almost

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.120
 always writing evaluations and running meetings of the only things

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.800
 I did by the time I got out in civilian life same kind of trend

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.490
 my day started out doing more technical things but then more and more

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.170
 got to be doing writing and playing visioning talking as as I went

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.850
 along silly day has changed in both cases
