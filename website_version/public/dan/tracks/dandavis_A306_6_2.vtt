people sometimes ask me about my musical abilities I have to tell them

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 their modest their modest I I do have a good year and I can hear tones

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.850
 I had a professional musician tell me once that he heard the whistling

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 and he was amazed that I was right on key which he said very

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.850
 few people are when they Whistler saying I would have to say the one

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.850
 person of the quality my voice is not very good I had three daughters

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 and when they were very very very ya'll they would ask me Daddy sing

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 me a song so I can go to sleep and the song I usually saying was

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.850
 the navy hill he turned all of the US strong to say and after awhile

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.850
 they would go to sleep but when they turned about three or four and

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.850
 I put him to bed they would say dad don't sing and you can hear from

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 that last cut why they said that dad don't see I'm sorry about that

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.850
 but that's just the way it is incidentally I was at a church meeting

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.850
 one night and everybody in the room were upper middle class highly

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.850
 educated very successful people or maybe five or six of us at this

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.850
 dinner and somebody told a story about how he picked new employees

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.850
 and he said he had a little magic violently have softened its if you

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.850
 had the salt what capability we give you don't have now and we all

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.850
 thought that was going to pick employees so I can remember so many

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.850
 ask the group assembled what what would if your little vial magic so

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.850
 what would you do and everybody saw it for awhile and then wrote down

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.850
 what they met and every single person there said I wish I had a good

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.850
 singing and it doesn't matter how hard you study or how hard you

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.850
 work you user Luciano Pavarotti or your Dan dates and I'm day and aids

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.850
 sorry
