00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.930
my favorite coding languages fortran for and I know you know you can get

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.000
 a copy of fortran for anymore but that's what I started out with

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.080
 and like an awful lot of people I you know what I really enjoy coding

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.160
 it's what I consider on the rights of Google fortran and joy during

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.230
 that these days though I probably spend more time reading PHP for

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.310
 websites and Java scripts for you know questionnaires to life than I

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:43.390
 do writing fortran but for trend is still my favorite language not

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.470
 a question how do you I feel like a field of programming your sciences

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:55.540
 I'm in computer science since nineteen seventy one in computer science

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.620
 has changed tremendously in that time when I took my first course

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.700
 in computers so I was structure on how to use for training for program

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.770
 one of Seymour craze for supercomputers the CDC sixty five hundred

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.850
 and that was wonderful and exciting work it turned out was really

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.930
 good at it sold my professor you talk to me one day about what I

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:32.000
 had in mind for profession and I told him I really would like to state

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.080
 in computers and he told me all day and this is remember nineteen

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.160
 seventy one you you won't be able to make any money in computers because

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.230
 soon there will only be two or three big computers in this nation

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:56.310
 state probably at big universities like one of cal tech and wanted

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.390
 in my tea and one at university of Illinois and everybody would

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.470
 use those computers and they're all feel very few compu to programmers

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.540
 doing all the program so I did not pursue it because I didn't think

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.620
 it was a growing field from what he told me and I think he was giving

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.700
 me good honest advice but it was certainly wrong because of course

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.770
 now everybody in his uncle has a computer not only on his desk but

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.850
 sometimes on his wrist watch and half the people playing with it

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.930
 do a little programming one kind or another so that's what's changed

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.000
 it's just huge compared to what we thought it would be in nineteen

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.080
 seventy one how much free time have you had in your career my career

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.160
 has provided me more for it was a wonderfully yeah just capital both

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.230
 of my crews who provided me more free time than I could use I'd you

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.310
 know you'd be surprised how much of the time when I get free time

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.390
 I spend it program and because that's what I love to do I spend it writing

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.470
 because that's what I love to do and in the military if you had

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.540
 a spare time at all not infrequent was spent working on another cryptologic

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.620
 problem we're trying to breaking new code or something of

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.700
 that nature so I have had more free time that I really wanted from

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.770
 from my career I've never felt constrained by that my wife unfortunate

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:57.850
 would tell you a very different story about my lack of free time

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.930
 spend with her how ethnically diverse as your Stanfield I think it's

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:10.000
 important that everyone have an ability and the opportunity to participate

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.080
 in any kind of work in one displayed and I am very unhappy when

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:22.160
 I hear about anybody who feels like they have been given a fair

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.230
 chance but it is my belief from what I've been able to observe that

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:34.310
 almost every place I've been there have been some representatives of

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:40.390
 virtually every ethnic group every gender every or you know sexual

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:46.470
 orientation preference available to people if they wanted to take it

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:52.540
 but I would be misleading you if I didn't say there seems to be some

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.620
 ethnic groups who seem to excel in this kind of work and who you see

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.700
 more often than other areas and it's frequently in computers it's

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:10.770
 amazing how many of the people I see at a conference if you just look

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.850
 around are of Asian or a sub continent Indian descent because those

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:22.930
 two ethnic groups seem to produce very good computer scientist but

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:29.000
 you see somebody from every conceivable group so you know that it's

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.080
 available to people who want to pursue it the more difficult the joints

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:41.160
 as our mind as far as access into stem fields I think places I've

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:47.230
 worked had been very open to everybody in fact have tried to aggressively

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:53.310
 go out and recruit people from different ethnic groups and

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:59.390
 make sure the gender Max the gender say the question and is it more

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:05.470
 difficult to join stand as a female or as a minority I can only speak

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:11.540
 from my own experience but my own experience has been that every

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:17.620
 place I've worked it's been very open to anyone based on their ability

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:23.700
 to do the job that seems to be the only criterion the people look

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:29.770
 for if there's been any kind of variance from that has been the aggressive

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:35.850
 attempts to recruit people from different ethnic groups in from

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:41.930
 different gender is to make sure the gender balance is correct but

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:48.000
 I have seen I have never seen any kind of attempt to keep one group

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.080
 from doing this trip no one would is it is a more difficult joins

00:06:54.080 --> 00:07:00.160
 them as a female or as a minority speaking from my own experience the

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:06.230
 ability for a female or a member of the minority to join he stem

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:12.310
 career he is completely done then unhampered in the United States I

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:18.390
 have worked in the military at work for businesses and I've worked in

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:24.470
 academia and I have never seen anyone suggest that they were restricting

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:30.540
 hiring somebody because of their sex gender ethnicity for any

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:36.620
 reason other than are they capable of doing the work so I think it's

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:42.700
 pretty wide open and there is even an aggressive attempt to try to

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:48.770
 achieve a better balance of ethnicity and gender within stem careers

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:54.850
 in both academia and industry what what characterizes a good career

00:07:54.850 --> 00:08:00.930
 one of the things that I frequently hear people say is that this career

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:07.000
 would make you more money than that career but it's been my experience

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.080
 that all of us are going to make enough money to satisfy our

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:19.160
 needs and even our caprices so the most important thing in a career

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:25.230
 is to do something with the issue too Hayden series of topless once

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:31.310
 so you get some sense of self fulfillment I team and I get a job that

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:37.390
 was necessary I did it well we achieved our goals the team that

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:43.470
 I worked with were all satisfied with what we did so I think the most

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:49.540
 critical thing in pursuing a career is finding a career it's going

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:55.620
 to give you that feeling at the end there will be enough money to to

00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:01.700
 live on and there will be enough to have a good life if you pursue

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:07.770
 that career goal that will give you that self fulfillment what don't

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:13.850
 you like about staff or your I like it all I've been in doubt of stem

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:19.930
 careers since I graduated from high school one way or the other

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:26.000
 that's a literal truth and I've really enjoyed all of the work I've

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.080
 done stem and I enjoy it still to this day did thing that I would really

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:38.160
 like to see the different about stem is I wish but government sometimes

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:44.230
 who is a little more responsive to supporting the stem research

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:50.310
 it will make a difference so frequently the government takes the

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:56.390
 approach of we need to pass a law and keep somebody from doing it

00:09:56.390 --> 00:10:02.470
 rather than that we need to fund some research than we can encourage

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:08.540
 people to do the right thing rather than trying to force them to do

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:14.620
 the right thing why should so sometimes you still got your that's a

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:20.700
 good description let me see if I get the guidance that went say it

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:26.770
 again why should someone choose to go into your system I have been and

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:32.850
 still both cryptology ended and computer science for a long
