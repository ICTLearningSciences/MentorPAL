I believe everybody should go to grad school if they are absolutely driven

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.420
 by what they've done in their undergraduate work and can't wait

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.710
 to learn more about it and can't wait to learn how to apply it better

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.990

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.990
 is just to make more money because I always find that making more

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.280
 money you see poor thing did base your life I think it's much better

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.560
 to base your life on doing something is going to be personally rewarding
