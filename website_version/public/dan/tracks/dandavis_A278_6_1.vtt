00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.990
active duty is an interesting term that means when you're serving full

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.140
 time in the military typically speak he when you talk about somebody

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.280
 being on active duty you mean when they were on for an extended enlistment

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.420
 of some kind in the regular services and for me that was four

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.560
 years running from April of nineteen seven to April of nineteen seventy

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.710
 one those four years I was on active duty in the United States

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.850
 Marine Corps and that was split up was about a year doing boot camp

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.990
 when my preliminary training as a Morse code operator then a year

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:47.140
 doing language training in Washington DC than a year in Vietnam and

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.280
 then about three months in Thailand and the old remaining nine months

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.420
 were devoted to training and mustering out in the United States in

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.560
 North Carolina so those four years but after that I got in the reserves

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.710
 and every year in the reserves you do two to four weeks of active

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.850
 duty most of us anyway every year so by the time I got reserves I

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.990
 done another sixteen weeks of active duty for training they call that

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.140

 of it in the United States San Diego Pensacola Washington DC places

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.420
 of that nature so all told I get about four years of active duty in

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.560
