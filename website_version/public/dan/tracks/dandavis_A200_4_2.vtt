00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.950
in academia mentor that I had had a great impact on me was the actual

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.050
 Paul is seen at cal tech I when I first went to work for Caltech Paul

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.150
 Hart heard me until the director at the supercomputing center there

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.250
 and just watching him was he a great great lesson for me I he was

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.350
 a man of invariable courtesy he did not talk much he kept his own counsel

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.450
 and he was always very gracious he was very old school he was

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.550
 born in Sicily I grew up in Panama but was educated United States in

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.650
 mathematics I learned a lot from him and I think if you get a mentor

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.750
 I hope it's a mentor that you can watch it action because you can

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.850
 learn more from the way they behave than what they tell you
