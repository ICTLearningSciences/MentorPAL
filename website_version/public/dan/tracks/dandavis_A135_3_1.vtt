00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.560
Crimes the military almost identical to the crimes you find in civilian

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.260
 life but the level of crime criminal activity is much reduced. It

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.970
 always is amazing to people to find out that the murder rate for instance

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.670
 in Vietnam was almost nonexistent. Everybody had a weapon, everybody

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.380
 had a weapon with ammunition, everybody was had orders to carry

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.090
 the weapon with ammunition all the time, and yet they did shoot each

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.790
 other. The few murders that happen in Vietnam were fraggings, that

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.500
 is throwing a hand grenade in to somebody, usually a senior officer,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.200
 or enlisted person. And a lot of that was racially motivated. So

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.910
 the crimes are not that different than the civilian life but they they're

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.610
 less of them probably because people with really serious criminal

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.320
 activity are not allowed to enlist. Then you have the additional

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.030
 crimes that you don't have in the military that do make up a lot of

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.730
 issues in the military. UA, unauthorized absence. Awol, you know stay

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.440
 out too long without leave, desertion, you know all those things

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.140
 that come about and are already crime in the military that do make

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.850
 up a lot of the activity in the criminal justice
