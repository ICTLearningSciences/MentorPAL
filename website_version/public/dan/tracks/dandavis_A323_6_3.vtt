internationalism has taken over in the stem fields I think most of the

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.450
 stem fields are uniform across the world it could be that there are

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.750
 more people in certain fields in certain countries but duh it's just

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.050
 become very international in its outlook so I think most of the stem

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.350
 fields with which I am familiar are the same from country to country

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.650
 to country and there's a lot of movement a lot of the people I know

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.950
 who were good in computer science research are now in Ireland or

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.250
 Great Britain or Japan my little brother spent about half his career

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.550
 in China when he worked for a Chinese for so I think there's very

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.850
 little difference across the world in computer research
