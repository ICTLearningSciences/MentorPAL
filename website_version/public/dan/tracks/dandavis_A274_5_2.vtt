00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.290
there was one time in the marine corps when I was made in charge of one

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.740
 of the classes Cole I was the same rank of everybody else in the class

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.180
 all I'd be a bit of E. three which is a PSC in the marine corps

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.630
 and some of them were still privates you but I was basically the same

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.070
 way but I was tall and so they may be charge and so one of the things

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.520
 I was supposed to do in charges after we had finished our session

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.960
 late in the afternoon I was to March the people it shall we get showered

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.410
 then everybody would go back more come back to the classroom

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.850
 to finish your evening classes alone who marched over together and

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.290
 it was important that you March over in the formation a state information

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.740
 and when you got there then you broke formation in that everybody

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.180
 would run to try to get the child life one day we came back in the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.630
 ring two or three other classes were being marched out along with

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.070
 mine and they broke out of formation before they were dismissed and

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.520
 ran to the challenge and my guys start to break out of my formation

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.960
 and I turned around in a blind rage that still amazes me to this day

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.410
 and I screamed at them get back after Lancs and they did it's amazing

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.850
 ability to and then I just miss them when they random word to back

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.290
 in line because these other guys who broke well somebody reported

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.740
 that incident to the breaking and running in the Chow line to the her

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.180
 people in charge the marines were in charge at the classes and they

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.630
 punished every unit for doing that and I went to them and said my

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.070
 gosh not break ranks they did not lead breaks until I dismissed and

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.520
 you can ask everybody in the whole tell you we do break ranks and the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.960
 people in charge said well the report we got was everybody broke

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.410
 ranks and they did note that you didn't break ranks in your group so

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.850
 we're punishing everybody gather and I said well I'm going to resign

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.290
 my leadership that because that's not right and a yawn let my troops

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.740
 death and like the the senior sergeant called me aside and said don't

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.180
 do that don't do that your troops soon though you you did your

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.630
 best and they will stick with you and yet there's no way I can overturn

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.070
 the senior people who boarded that we punish all so that's a time

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.520
 when I I really sought to bring or did the wrong thing they should

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.960
 have done a better investigation and said everybody's unit except Davis

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.410
 gets punished his didn't break ranks may get from the challenge
