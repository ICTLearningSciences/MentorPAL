00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.370
the navy has a lot better chance of having transferable skills learned

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.900
 by you than for instance that one of the service militaria infantry

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.420
 type services I mean I was a M. sixty machine gunner in Vietnam as

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.950
 well as a linguist hard to find many jobs is him sixty machine gun so

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.470
 let's talk about those difficult position in the marine corps if you're

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.990
 in in sixty machine gun or what he kept telling to get out a return

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.520
 to civilian life they offered you something called project transition

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.040
 where you can go learned a marine corps field or civilian field

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.560
 if necessary that might be useful to you for instance just because

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.090
 I wanted to do for fun I put in for that project and I was assigned

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.610
 to the base photo lab where I was able to do photographing development

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.140
 and learn photographic skills which would've been very useful

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.660
 in civilian life and I wanted to pursue that as a profession so that's

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.180
 one way to look at it but my linguistic skills academia accepted

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.710
 my language training I got almost I think it was like twelve hours of

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.230
 credit in my from my language training from the military they just

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.750
 accepted but the major thing that I got was every place I've gone people

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.280
 said the man who is senior enlisted or an officer in the military

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.800
 has shown management discipline and and group choose patient characteristics

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.330
 which would be valuable to me and that has all transferred

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.850
 very well
