00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.780
After being elevated from lance corporal to a corporal in the marine corps

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.710
 I was considered a non commissioned officer and my reporting seniors

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.640
 thought that I had excellent potential and wrote good fitness

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.560
 reports for me. When I got in the reserves I was cross service from

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.490
 them and E-6 staff sergeant the marine corps to E-6 cryptologic technician

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.420
 first class in the navy. After serving there for two years I

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.350
 took the chief's exam and I passed the chief's exam which meant I would

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.280
 be promoted to chief petty officer when that position became available.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.210
 But a program came about called the direct commissioning program

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.140
 where experienced people like myself were offered a chance for

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.060
 a commission so I was a direct commission based on my previous service

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.990
 and activities and became commission at that time as an ensign O-1,

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.920
 and then after that was promoted regularly based again on reviews

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.850
 from my seniors
