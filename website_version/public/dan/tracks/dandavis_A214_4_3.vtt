00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.560
change his way of life in both cryptology and in high performance computing

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.280
 it's based on change high performance computing advances because

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.990
 of the change well we now have a quantum computer at USC cryptology

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.710
 is also based on change as soon as you learn to exploit certain signals

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.420
 those signals go away are changed because the other side will

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.140
 find out that you're exploiting their signals so it's always change

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.850
 so changes not only challenger but it's the joy of it
