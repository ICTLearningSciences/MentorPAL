I don't think your lifestyle will change much if you're in the navy, basically

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.850
 speaking the navy is not Big Brother it doesn't get in everything

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.350
 you do if you're on board a ship or with a small group of people

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.850
 in a small unit, you must learn to get along with everybody and

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.350
 adopt the mores of group you don't want to be the odd man out all the

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.850
 time. So to some degree you may learn to curb your tongue a little

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.350
 if you're on board but that's true and academic life as well. There

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.850
 are political stances that most academics take that not everybody at

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.350
 the table takes, but one learns to keep your own counsel and and get

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.850
 along so lifestyle changes you need to make in both academia and

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.350
 the navy are modest compared to what you might think they would be.
