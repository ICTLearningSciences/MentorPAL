00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.280
in considering a career it's critical that you seek as much reliable information

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.720
 as you can get do not go from what you see on T. V. are in

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.150
 the movies oral what maybe a buddy tells you he thinks is going on

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.590
 talk to as many people in the career field as you can get a hold of

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.020
 do your research from government agencies that apartment labor has

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.460
 a very good run down of what each feels like what people do in that

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.890
 field with requirements for the field are and what the future looks

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.330
 like I think you need more jobs or fewer jobs so there's a lot of research

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.760
 you can do there when you talk about the military one of the

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.200
 best sources of information is the web of all the military forces have

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.630
 very very elaborate web pages explaining to you the requirements

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.070
 to get there and what the advantages are and that to some degree they're

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.500
 trying to sell you wanted so they've got something they're trying

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.940
 to sell you but try to avoid the adventure and you can go see and

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.370
 where neat uniform kind of stuff and you know what's really going to

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.810
 be like in this act when I'm really going to enjoy so that's one good

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.240
 thing to do with a good thing to do I think is some historical research

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.680
 if you wanna know what it's like in the navy you know get some

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.110
 good books on naval history and read up on what it's like read books

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.550
 about people who've been in recently who have written accounts of

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.980
 what their experience has been and because most that's been carefully

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.420
 fact checked and would be in the book if it worked pretty well while
