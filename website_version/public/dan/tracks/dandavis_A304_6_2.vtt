00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.780
live your long life now I'm seventy three years old and one of things

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.720
 when I look back as I look back and I think of all the people I knew

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.650
 over those decades could have helped me could help me be better at

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.580
 what I do could help me with problems I had and I didn't have access

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.520
 to that really bothers me now looking back seeing all those missed

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.450
 opportunities so I am part of a project is trying to create a database

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.380
 of assistance for people like I used to be who may need help today

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.320
 so that they can get a way to find out how do I pick a career what's

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.250
 a career like what is the variability said I should be looking at

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.180
 and what do I do now if I want to pursue those issues and so the way

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.120
 I can help you is by responding to questions you have asked me about

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.050
 career or being in the military or life in general that I might be

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.980
 able to help you with not by giving you advice but just by telling

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.920
 you how it's been for me what my life it's been like and what I learned

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.850
 from that and what you analyze it as you will
