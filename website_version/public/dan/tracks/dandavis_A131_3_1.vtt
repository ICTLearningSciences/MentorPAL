00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.850
When I was in the sixth grade we moved from Illinois where I grew up to

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 Colorado springs. And so from the sixth grade through the end of college

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.850
 I was a native of Colorado. In Colorado there was a lot of empty

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 space for shooting and so I have shot in the hundreds my entire

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.850
 life. Small game big game birds and the like. So I am in inveterate

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.850
 a shooter one of my best buddies in high school hand loaded his own

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 ammunition for a big bore rifle so we fired big bore rifles all the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 time. In the military I was allowed to fire tremendous number rounds

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.850
 for qualification in practice, and in Vietnam I was in the M16 machine

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.850
 gun or so I got to test fire that machine gun and and burned up

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.850
 a lot of ammunition through that. So I have a shot still like to shoot

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 but I live in Los Angeles now so don't get much opportunity to shoot

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.850
 much anymore even though I still have a number of weapons
