I think you should be prepared to go to college and I don't think I was

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.940
 very well prepared college I had very few instructors who drove me

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.490
 to do the kinds of work I was able to do I think to some degree a lot

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.030
 of the instructors I had a high school weren't aware of the kind

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.580
 of work I could do, so I think it's kind of difficult to say what you

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.120
 need to do to get ready to go to college but I think the most important

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.670
 thing is you have to learn to think not just regurgitate what

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.210
 you've been told, but think and analyze think and analyze argue it out

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.760
 with your friends take a position that you don't even like and see

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.300
 if you can convince them your position is correct and learn to write

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.850
 an articulate your ideas.
