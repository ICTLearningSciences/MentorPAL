I think the best way to deal with males like the ones that you interact

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.140
 with every single day in the ones that you're always that you know

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.780
 like at work or at school like whatever it is especially in engineering

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.420
 and in the military.  Like you know like yeah I'm the minority

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.060
 like I'm one of the only females but like why should that make a difference,

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.710
 they're all gonna be my friends like male or female like if

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.350
 you're a great person and if you want to do fun things if you're creative

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:13.990
 and if you're smart and if you’re like driven like just like

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.640
 that's the person that I want to be surrounded with and I'm gonna be

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.280
 friends with that person no matter their gender and if there's anything

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.920
 that ever said, you know that's maybe that might be a little bit

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.560
 discriminatory towards me being the only female, I say something and

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.210
 I can say something because I'm friends with all of them and I know

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.850
 it's like as a friend that they will accept me.
