00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.850
One of the best advantages that I took advantage of while I was in college

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.850
 and in the ROTC program was studying abroad.   I studied abroad

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.850
 twice.  I did once in London for a summer program, so two months and

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.850
 then I did once a full semester in South Africa Cape Town and so that

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 was six months over there. And while you go to school you're gonna

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.850
 learn a lot about yourself but once you start traveling, for me personally,

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.850
 I was really able to like find my strengths and weaknesses

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.850
 like find what I really like to what I didn't like and I like kind

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.850
 of found this new energy and like this new love for, for, life and

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 for culture and for trying new things and so I highly highly recommend

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.850
 studying abroad.
