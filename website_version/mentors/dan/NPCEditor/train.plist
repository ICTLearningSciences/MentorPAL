So that would have been at that time 1973 when I enlisted in the navy and then I served in the navy for two years is in the list of man and was commissioned in 1975 and then finally retired in about 2003</string>

<string>virtually everyone in the military is an officer of one kind or another. After you go through your first three pay grades E-1 through three the next pay grade is either noncommissioned officer in the ground forces or petty officer in the naval forces. Above that we have a warrant officers who are technical specialists who rate between a non commissioned officers and commissioned officers, and then you have commissioned officers.

<string>After being elevated from lance corporal to a corporal in the marine corps I was considered a non commissioned officer and my reporting seniors thought that I had excellent potential and wrote good fitness reports for me. When I got in the reserves I was cross service from them and E-6 staff sergeant the marine corps to E-6 cryptologic technician first class in the navy. After serving there for two years I took the chief's exam and I passed the chief's exam which meant I would be promoted to chief petty officer when that position became available. But a program came about called the direct commissioning program where experienced people like myself were offered a chance for a commission so I was a direct commission based on my previous service and activities and became commission at that time as an ensign O-1, and then after that was promoted regularly based again on reviews from my seniors</string>

<string>The thing that most civilians don't realize that even in a combat zone most of the military personnel are not assigned to weapons duty but have other kinds of duties as a cryptologist. My day was broken up into eight hours on watch using my linguistic capabilities to further the effort, then on off duty time I had time to take care of my gear, eat, sleep, and do maintenance on the trench line in defensive positions around our particular area. On occasion, quite regularly actually we would get hit by mortars and rockets at which point even if you were on watch you went to the trench line in the special crew took over your watch duties, while you may have that trench line in case the attack was more than just rockets. When I was at CON TN and we had people in the wire, that is trying to get into our compound, one time but other than that it was pretty much just doing your technical job and taking care review defensive position and taking care of yourself</string>

<string>Every person has to learn to face fears they have, and it's much easier to face those fears if you're with a group of people that you love and who care for you. I was worried like everyone else was, but when the first rounds came in the very first night we got hit, I found that I was in the company of people who were supportive, and I had had the advice of the senior sergeant who said "When you first get hit when there's first incoming, just remember what your job is and focus on I've got to do my job" and I followed that advice and it got me through every event we went through, and I can never tell you that I was abnormally frightened. I was alarmed sometimes but I was never in panic or afraid and and you just gotta get through it because the people around you were getting through it with you and I think that the group means everything in a case like this.</string>

<string>The marine corps has a tradition that every member of the chorus is an infantryman of heart so I carried an M 60 machine gun head to my duty station, and when we got called to the trench lines if we thought we might get attacked my job was to get my machine gun and my ammunition and be ready to repel the attack. That never happened while I was there, but I had other duties, such as manning the outside perimeter where a sergeant of the guard from time to time, or building up our defenses by digging trenches and new bunkers and the like. But basically my time in Vietnam was spent doing my cryptologic duties</string>

<string>One of the things that I think the military is very good as training I had excellent training when I was in the service- both basic infantry training and the technical training I had. I spent almost a year in Washington DC learning Vietnamese. I spent six months in Pensacola learning how to do Morse code so I could do that as well and then I had good training before I went to Vietnam which they called staging training, where they get you prepared to to fight if that's required of you. Training beyond that, had I stayed in, would have been excellent as well but when I got in the reserves I got good training every time I went on my two week duty or my weekend duty</string>

<string>I don't know whether you should join the navy I'm not here to try to talk you into joining the navy but I can tell you there's some really good things about doing the navy. And one of those is to travel, the other is getting to know different people, finding out things about yourself you might not find out if you are challenged by something like duty in the navy. And more than anything else the camaraderie of being with a group of men devoted to doing one task whether it's driving a ship or being in a submarine or doing an intelligence action like I'd spent my time doing.</string>

<string>If you're considering joining the navy I think you need to think very carefully about it. Remember it's not something you can decide to do today and quit doing it tomorrow, it does involve you signing up for a period of time but I've known people who joined the navy for a million different reasons and a lot of them found out that the navy did not satisfy the need they thought it was going to satisfy, but it did bring about some change in them that was a good positive change that they were anticipating. But I think the main thing is is when you go sign on the dotted line with the recruiter knowing that you've signed on the dotted line to serve that many years and they're not gonna wanna let you go.</string>

And we got from historical bases, a class of people considered commissioned officers who seemed Ringling news here you dition intelligence and education that would allow them to be in charge of enlisted people those winds are blowing these days when I was in Vietnam we were very proud of the fact that our intelligence field required higher test scores than the officer candidate school required so those are blurring and so frequently a lot of your technical direction comes from senior NCOs and not from officers but officers are required because their commission by the US government and that commission allows them to do things like administering oaths or citing certain pieces of paper they sign incidently would you become a commissioned officer you swear to a different oaths in the enlisted people so there is a difference between them but not much should be made of that if you're considering a military career</string>

<string>An NCO or petty officer in the navy is a non commissioned officer and that means there are people who have certain responsibilities in leadership but people who have not gotten a commission from the president of the United States. So they are the kind the middle managers of the military organization. Typically the word flows down from the admirals the generals chief of staff through the senior commissioned officers to junior commissioned officers who who then pass the word on to the chiefs and senior sergeants who then pass the word on to the enlisted personnel</string>

<string>I think the military these days is in excellent place for acareer. You get better training, better travel, better stability and a chance to test your own medals. One thing that is true about the service is it will show you that you have strengths that you did not know you had before you went in</string>

<string>A typical day for a cryptologist is to spend eight hours of that day on what they call watch, which means your duty station would be to go into your office or your facility or your bunker and you would have some duties of analyzing data that you had received in producing reports. You would do that for eight hours without break, if you needed to have food the food would be brought to you on station and then at the end of that eight hours you would have typically sixteen hours off. But in most combat or other kinds of emergency situations you would work up to twelve hours a day doing your technical job. When your state side, your duty would probably be like four to six hours today with a lot of off time a lot of slack time to make up for the extra time we had to put in when you were in a combat situation or deployed overseas</string>

<string>The navy pays a lot better than the civilian population thinks about. The best way to find out what people are in the navy is you can go to computer online and look up the navy pay scales. But navy pay is comparable to civilian pay in almost every one of their levels of of competence, which means when you first joined up a you're getting a decent living wage and by the time you retire you're making as much as your civilian counterparts are. So like a navy captain is is making you know order a hundred thousand dollars a year.</string>

<string>Because I enlisted in the marine corps fifty years ago now it's been, the pay scales back then were much lower. So you had it basically enough just to take care of a clothing maybe save up enough to go home for Christmas on a plane or something. But all everything else too provided by the marine corps, that is they gave you food every day they give you a place to live you give your clothes to wear, so you didn't need much money. Then you know you got more and more senior you got better pay. You certainly did not make his mouth when you enlisted to support a family but that's changed now. People who list today can support a family very early on in their careers. They used to say in the marine corps of if the marine corps wanted you to have a spouse they would have issued you want in your seabag. And they didn't do that. But now the progression up to the senior ranks of the either enlisted or the commission officer ranks, very good pay all the way up in good allowances for housing and the like.</string>

<string>On a typical day the hours you work in the military vary depending on the kind of duty you're serving. If you're serving overseas, especially in the combat zone, obviously in your in active combat you may be serving twenty four hours a day. But even in a combat zone doing technical work you're probably going to be working almost half of every day seven days a week. But then when you get back state side you're given kind of easy duty, a lot of slack time, and you might only work part time during the day. And then there's a lot of leave that you can take so even in Vietnam, we were given an opportunity to take what they call 'basket leave' that is done charge leave of of the week every couple of months. You could take some time off and there were times when they would stand out to you where it would just have time. So it varies all over the place and that's of one of the benefits of one of the problems with the military is it isn't steady, sometimes it is working all day and sometimes it it's take it easy.</string>

<string>During the stateside duty, the problems you dealt with largely were the boredom and the tedium of training and the like. And keeping your team together and keeping morale up. In a combat or deployed situation problems were just existing in doing your job which was vital in compelling, and everything else kind of shrank beyond the necessity of doing the best job you could because you knew everything you did would make a difference as to whether someone lived or died</string>

<string>the reading of history indicates that alcohol has been an issue with military people since time immemorial and it is still a problem today to some degree but it is the eve important part of the military experience in my own take on of the history of of the military and it is surprising to me that even though the people I knew in the military drank proficiency amounts of liquor and beer and wine when they got all the military went back to family life of very few of them had any problems with alcohol so the word alcoholics per se but they resist used to drinking a lot in the military so I think is there no more problems with drink in the military than there are civilian life</string>

<string>From the time I enlisted in the marine corps in 1967 until I retired in 2003 from the navy reserve, I would say I flew someplace in the nation or overseas twice to three times every year. So there's quite a bit of travel involved in it. I like travel so that was a good thing, but there are other jobs it didn't travel quite as much as I did, and some jobs of course where you're flying all the time</string>

<string>Because I was in the Cryptologic service I did not do a port call per se, because most cryptologists don't spend a lot of time at sea. So I would tell you that it over my career I spent time in San Diego, camp Pendleton, Washington DC, Pensacola, Florida, several tours at fort Meade. Overseas I have been places like Hong Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, London in the UK, Naples, Italy, I stopped once in France. So quite a few visits to varying places. Another classic port call because it wasn't because my ship was stopping there but because I was traveling. I also spent time in Japan Australia, Okinawa Hawaii been been all over had good times every place</string>

<string>As an enlisted man in the marine corps, I spent about half my time in the work uniform which was called utilities which were the green rough cloth uniforms that were worn in combat areas, or combat fatigues which we wore in Vietnam. But then about half the time I was in dress uniform like when I was in language school in Washington DC we wore dress uniforms all the time, which was the green coat during the winter months, or the khakis during summer months. When I got in the navy I start out wearing the bell bottom enlisted uniform but almost immediate with god in the officer ranks where I wore dress blues in the winter or summer whites in the summer, with full dress whites which were the choker whites uniforms, during that time. But almost always the dress uniform, although I had work uniforms the navy for when I went to the range to qualify and was a range officer, for instance for marksmanship instruction</string>

<string>One of the things they really convince you is true in the marine corps and I don't think I've ever met a marine who didn't believe it, was wearing the uniform as a matter of great pride. So the marines put that in me and it's been in me ever since and I've really enjoyed wearing the uniform. But I did have one commanding officer who like to wear the uniform so much that would we'd fly with some place in the reserve for the weekend, when we came back from that trip, he would always make sure we waited till the last minute, so we didn't have changed it a time to change into our civilian clothes before we got on the plane so we always fly home in our summer whites, which your white shoulder boards with the ribbons and everything because he loved to fly wearing uniform. We always got good comments from the people on the plane</string>

<string>Cryptology both in the civilian realm and in the military realm is filled with pressure. There is pressure to get the intelligence quickly, correctly, and to forward it on. There's the knowledge that you may have insights which is so vital to the nation that any failure on your part could have drastic consequences. As is so often true in life, that's also one of the pluses to doing this kind of work is knowing you're doing something worthwhile. But knowing that you have to do it right or someone will literally die can be a pressure that can get to you over a period time, and I've seen people he rocked emotionally because they've rendered such pressure so often for so long a time</string>

<string>People sometimes ask me considering the time you spend in the military what would you have done differently or what should you have done instead of what you did do, and I'm reminded of the story of General Alexander and Anthony Eden who went to Winston Churchill's funeral, and they were talking about their wartime experiences in World War Two, on the steps of Saint Paul's after the service. And one of them said to the other, and I can't remember which way it went, 'don't you wish we had it all to do over again' and the other would responded 'no we might not do half so well the next time,' and that's the way I feel about my military career. My military career has been such a joy to be and has gone so well that had I all the do it over again I'd say now just let me do it just the way it worked out. I enjoyed it just the way it worked out, I wouldn't change a damn thing</string>

<string>What people do after the get off active duty depends on the experiences they had when they were on active duty. Some people, at least temporarily, are so bitter about it that they don't want anything to do with the service and want to get as far away from it as they can, and what they try to do is find a complete new way of life. People who enjoyed it or stayed with it all the whole time that they finally retired from it, frequently go into duty that has something that's related back to their military service. In my case I wound up doing military simulation work for all the universities I worked with</string>

<string>I think one of the most important things in your life is making a choice about where you want to go and then pursuing that. But I've seen so many people pursue the wrong goal in their life and wind up in something they were a very good at. In my case when I joined the marine corps had no idea that I wanted to go in cryptology, but looking back on it, the marine corps knew better than I did about which way I was going. And now that I know what I know about myself I just hit the stand in awe of the fact that they somehow knew that about me better than I did and so I think there are times when you have to listen to what other people are telling you about, 'you know you'd really fit very well in that area not here you've picked out for yourself'.</string>

<string>New members of the military first have to get used to the fact that they are no longer the center of the universe, and that what they owe is is a debt of allegiance to their immediate buddies in their unit and that their buddies will take care of them but they have to take care of their buddies, and that's a different mindset. I think people who've gone through team athletics have that mindset and can pick it up very rapidly, but a lot of people who are new to the military don't get that you have to learn that you're not as important as everybody else is together you have to learn that kind of cohesiveness and camaraderie that keeps going and part of that is the group needs to be responsive to leadership, and once you've learned that cohesive group and responsive to leadership then your life is golden in the military.</string>

<string>My time in the marine corps and the navy were the best times of my life and I do miss being in the navy and being able to do it all over again. I recently got a chance to go to a boot camp graduation down in San Diego with one of my best volleyball playing buddies from my service, the warrant officer Sam Werner. And as we watched the young recruits being briefed before they took off on their careers, both of us were absolutely overcome by such emotions and such yearning to be part of that again and be part of the adventure and part of the excitement. So yes I do miss it I miss virtually every part of it. But one of the good things about the service is my marine corps friends from Vietnam and language school, and all of my navy buddies from twenty plus years of cryptologic service all correspond with me consistently online. I get an email from an old veteran buddy two or three times a day, sometimes just a joke they like your something but sometimes the a deep discussion about a problem they're facing or just check in on how I'm doing. So yes I do miss it but to a large degree it came with me.</string>

<string>By and large your private time of the service is your own and you are not obligated to do any work on it, but like every other job that you have in civilian life even, there are a lot of things that you just can't get done for your work at work. It may be reading it may be studying it may be going over a presentation. You're going to do or something and the navy's like that too and the marine corps was as well. So there are times and at night especially when you're doing training or at school where it may be your private time you may be off duty you may be at home but you have to pull out the books you have to pull out your studies and spent a little time on them.

<string>Like everything else in life the navy gives you a lot but it demands of you a lot, and that's true about the marine corps probably even more so. And what other things that that both the corps and the navy demand of you is separation from the ones you love. If you're married or if you have a family of any kind to whom you are responsible, you'll be obligated to spend time away from there's no doubt about that. It's nothing like it was in days of yore historically speaking of a male Whaler in Boston in the early eighteen century would leave Boston and be gone for two or three years was no communication back to his wife children parents as to whether he was even still alive or not and then which show back up and be around for a few months than them gone again. Nothing like that, but you do have to endure a significant separation from family and friends</string>

<string>A popular topic of discussion these days is stress the you know post traumatic stress syndrome and other symptoms dealing with stress. Admiral Arleigh Burke said there's no greater stress in life than the stress upon the commander in combat and that's may very well be true. But there's a lot of stress even on non combat please the cryptologic community for instance someone should have to endure a great deal of danger and not be able to respond aggressively but were forced to do there cryptologic duties, even though there were as they use to say bullet holes appearing in the side of the tent. So there is stress and that can be stressful. But within my experience said stress which is understood by the service, is well treated by the service and relief was given for it. And the biggest help was the fact you were going through that stress with close comrades, who do together and that allows you all to enter the stress better</string>

<string>Life is full of trouble and sometimes it turns out you're the one that causes the trouble, and if you get in trouble in the navy they will deal with it fairly and not harshly and they will give you a second chance to make good that depending on the severity of the issue. I for instance was once hauled before the committing officer, for the offensive being more than the allowed number of miles from my duty station on the overnight liberty, that is I was supposed to just stay in town and go drinking and I'd go over to Duke University visit with my younger brother and saw him in that when I go back to camp le June, I had been more than sixty miles from my base on overnight liberty, and so I was but adjuidicated as guilty of that and yet other than a minor fine, which strangely enough I never paid because the company clerk just kind of hid the fine from the pay records, I had no impact at all fofromr that. As you can see it allowed me to get a commission in the navy and rise to the rank of commander. So more serious offenses of course more serious punishment and longer term consequence</string>

<string>The services work very hard to find just the right job for you, the one of which you are capable and the one which in which you could excel. They don't make very many mistakes but they do from time to time make mistakes sometimes. You may not like the work as much as you'd hoped, but usually you can find it challenging and fulfilling. Occasionally you find you can't really do the work for which you were trained. When I was in Vietnam we had a man who was trained as a Morse code operator, and he could do it under practice conditions but real conditions it just turned out he wasn't very good at it. So there was no great problem, they just found another job that he could do. They made him the duty teletype operator and he was very good at teletype operations and I can remember him still sitting that teletypewriter just pounding away day and night. You know didn't make mistakes, just perfect at it. Sometimes the service can accommodate you that way other times they can find something else for you to do, but by and large I see ninety five percent of guys I knew fit well in the jobs of the military gave them and did well at that and enjoy it when they were done with. The guys I knew who were cryptologists love the work, almost to a man, they loved the work here</string>

<string>Well if it turns out you're not really good at it, or you don't want to do what you want to do and you want to change careers you might be able to do that. One of my best friends was an academy graduate, and his first job was as a missile officer and he hated being a missile officer, so he crossed transferred branches into their cryptologic community within his service, and was allowed to do that, but it was very difficult. And he was counseled by some fairly high ranking officers about why he shouldn't do that and how it would hurt his career and keep him from advancing. But he did get that finally approved, he made the switch and he retired as a full colonel in the airforce. So you can make a switch, but boy it's really tough to do that you'd almost be better to finish your tour of duty whatever it is and then enlist in another service, and ask for special duty in that other service in the field you really think you'd like to be in. But by and large try to find joy in what you've been assigned to do and do the best you can that you be best off.</string>

<string>Sometimes the original choice you made for a branch of the service was based on erroneous notion of what they would be doing and after you've served, while especially if you've served with some of the other branches you may say "gosh I wish I hadn't joined service A, I wish I'd join service B instead". If that happens what are the options you have and I would have to tell you they're pretty limited. If you signed on the dotted line saying I will serve for six to eight years what have you signed for in service a. They put a lot of money and you investing in boot camp for your non productive and in your training where you're non productive and they finally got to the point where you're productive, they're disinclined to say "well okay we'll just call it even and you can go join another armed force". So it's very very difficult to change forces except between enlistments. I enlisted originally in the marine corps, did four years active duty then did two years of non pay reserve duty, in which I was going to drills but not getting paid for it. But I finished up my entire six year enlistment before I got my honorable discharge from themarine corps, reenlisted but in the Navy, enlisted the navy as an enlisted person then got commissioned later on. That worked out fine, the marine corps is happy, the navy's happy, the only problem is mine marine corps buddies arent happy because that they consider that an act of treason for me to join the Navy. They would've been happier if I'd join the Russian army that for me to have joined the Navy</string>

<string>When you enlist in the military you're basically signing a contract saying you agreed to do something and you agree to it for a period of time, usually a number of years at least. Once you've signed that a your legally and morally and ethically in my mind, obligated to commit to that contract and finish it up. But what happens if you have a severe set of circumstances that have changed? If your health fails, or if your family has a dire need your the only surviving son for parents who cannot take care of themselves or something a nature. There are rare occasions when the military will allow you an early out to take care of those kinds of issues, but by and large I think you should never go into any contract with the intention of quitting it. And that's certainly goes for the military, because leaving the military in the lurch, you know if there is a missing person on the firing line, that means the remainder of us on the firing line or put in danger. So the military takes a very serious view of that contract so you really should not go the military with the idea of "oh I'll try it a couple of months then go out". So it's very hard to quit the military</string>

<string>One of the real benefit you get in the military is stability. Even during the depression, they were not throwing people out of the military as long as you perform well and get good marks from you seniors, you can stay in the military twenty thirty years and retire. There occasionally have been rifts like after World War two, more people want to stay in the service than they had spots for, so some people had to be excused from the service. And that was particularly true in the officer ranks, enlistined people who had gotten elevated to officer ranks earlier in the war, when the war was over were hoping to stay as officers. But frequently they were told "no we're sorry we just don't have enough officer billets so you must revert" then most of those reversions were back to a senior enlisted rating. And then when it came time to retire, the person was allowed to retire at their rank that they had achieved in the reserve duty. And so that means if I were a captain and I got sent back to staff sergeant and then made my way up to master sergeant before I had time to retire, I probably would retire as a major because the captain normal would get promoted to major. And so they allow me to retire but, in general, employment once again you can stay as long as you want and they want you to stay as long as you can.</string>

<string>The armed forces have always been beset by a lack of career orientation of first time enlistees and it still is. So virtually all of the turnover is after the first enlistment is up. So after a guy signs up does his four yearsm sees how you like it or not, sees other opportunities on the outside, they may leave they may leave like I did and then immediately get in the reserves because they enjoy that part of it, I or they may leave and never want anything to do with it again. So in terms of turnover but you mainly see is junior enlisted people usually E3s or E4s, sometimes E fives and sixes getting out, sometimes you see junior officers, O2's or so. An O2 would be like a first lieutenant army a lieutenant JG in the navy getting out after their first tour</string>

<string>The military is always looking for people who speak other languages and they will train you if you don't know the language they need you know. When I got done with Morse code training in Pensacola after my first year in the marine corps they sent me to Washington DC for an entire year to learn Vietnamese. A lot of people get that obligation and opportunity. I enjoyed the training and was trained in Vietnamese. I was trained as a christological linguist not an interpretor or an interrogator so that's a little different duty, but there those are the two languages that I was certified to speak by the marine corps air. In high school I learned a little French and in college I learned little German. And now at my age by German and French are still much better because of so comparable to English. English being made up of Anglo Saxon and and French words, that it's just makes sense to me. Vietnamese is a total Asian language and because it was so strange to me. I was good at what I was doing that but as soon as I quit doing it it went away from me very fast. The only thing I can do now is very very basic conversational Vietnamese hello goodbye 1,2,3, kinds of things.</string>

<string>The solution of technical issues in the stem fields is always very very interesting and I have had in both my military and my civilian life technical issues confront me which I had to work on. To give you an example in cryptology without going into anything is pretty good classified if I can, we were all looking at how to recognize the particular non voice signal that is an electronic signal that was propagated, but had to be identified, and the question was 'could you identify it better by ear or by a oscilloscope tracing?' And the oscilloscope tracing gave you some parameters that could be compared for instance by digitizing the the aveform and analyzing the digitized waveform. We found strange slid off that the human ear was better at detecting the difference signals and it could detect that kind of equipment that was emitting that signal and surprisingly enough, it's hard to explain the physics in the physiology of this, it could even detect a particular machine. That is the signal is different enough that the human ear listening could couldn't even tell you what the difference was, but they can say that's machine in place A-prime and the other single was machine via place B prime. And think about that when you hear my voice compared to Cary Grant's voice how can you tell it's me and not Cary Grant or vice versa. You just do as somehow you can pick out those very fine different sets of technical issues. Technical issues in the civilian world looking at payroll processing how you break down a huge problem and rode on a bunch of processors, used to be just ten or twenty, but then I got to use hundreds and then thousands and then tens of thousands of processors that's a very interesting theoretical issue and a practical one that I had to solve.</string>

<string>some of us are born loving technology and were more loving people and it just seems like we never have enough time for either one of them or both so the question is in the kinds of work I've done how much time do you spend sitting with technology and how much time do you spend with people I would have to tell you in both my military and then civilian careers I spent probably equal amounts of time with both those and I enjoyed that kind of balance in my life in my military time there were lots of times we working it technically sure cryptologic issue where you had to work alone and you had to tune out anybody who's around but on the other hand almost everything I've done in the military including best kind of analysis was done in a room full of people doing the same sorts of things I was doing and people whom you could turn and say Hey Joe have you been able to figure out how the Abercrombie from food network's the need to know Dan how about this one and you work it out together on the other hand as a civilian yet nothing I love to do more than sit at my computer and I am in the flow doing code that the world just goes away but when the other things I love to do is go to a conference in running the booth and talking everybody who comes to my boots but kinda work we do so I love both in again civilian military fifty fifty technology and people</string>

<string>The question often comes in management circles, "how much do you tell the troops?", "how much do you tell your employees?", "how much is too much?" A lot of people have a problem with telling the people working for them too much because they say my power is I know things my people don't know therefore they will have to come to me to find out what's going on and I will be powerful. I've never felt that way. I've always felt like you should flow everything you know down to the people. Let them sit through what they want and retain what they don't. And you keep your ears open for anything falling back up. So you know what's going on. So I feel like I've always tried to get everybody understand what my goals are and try to understand what my bosses I would say the military is probably better at articulating the goals of the organization. Setting forth the objective and letting people know how they really should behave. The famous military historian Kagan has pointed out that Ulysses Grant was very good at saying 'you need to take your division a move to that side of of the line,' he would say you need to move that side of the line so why because I need someone to support over there with artillery to keep them from moving in that direction, so you need to block them. So the guy knew what he was supposed to do not just what he had to do- but what am I supposed to accomplish. Civilian life I've had some bosses who never really explain to me what it was I was supposed to be accomplishing, or how it would be great to accomplish. Sometimes it's good sometimes it's bad but I think that military does a better job than civilians.</string>

<string>If you are in the Naval Services you'll hear people talking about saying I was in port. Which means I was not out at sea and then in port  can mean your at your home base or could mean your important at a port call at a foreign country or a different port from your own base but in the United States. In the marine corps the equivalent would be on base at my home base which means I'm on where I usually am I can get out and do liberty take some relaxation as opposed to being on deployment or so busy that I never have time to myself.</string>

In my case when I was a cryptologist, I was a C. T. ,cryptologic technician, one, which means I was like A six of which would be a staff sergeant in the army and that was my rate. C. T. on the other hand is what they call a rating and that describes the kind of work you do in that case you're a technical person working on cryptology. That is, the understanding the analysis and the breaking of codes.</string>

<string>Well I had kind of an interesting way to go through the service. After I'd work my way up from boot camp to morse code training to language school to some advanced training and then duty in combat zones. I got out of the Marine Corps and joined the Navy because I got all that the Marine Corps and had gotten out of the Marine Corps as a staff sergeant and A six, the Navy let me list as an E six cryptologic technician interpretive branch one. So it is a first class petty officer CTI one. That was my first position and that position is charged with doing various translations of foreign languages that are products of the cryptologic process but I think it's by as much as I can see about that.</string>

<string>I am currently retired from the military which means I have completed these twenty good years and am eligible to retire. In my case, I did four years active duty in the Marine Corps and I've done about twenty good years in the reserves that means years where I went to drill once a month for an entire weekend and then did two weeks every year for training. More specialized training. I wound up putting a lot more time than that, but that was required for me to get some retirement status. So I am currently retired military, which means the President could call me back active duty if he ever wanted to. I am of an age where that might be pretty unlikely but I would have to say during World War Two people my age and physical fitness, I'd like  to say I I'm pretty fit I can walk two miles I get around pretty well,  I could be recalled active duty probably would be sent to the front line to do shooting but might be given a job instructing at the Roxy thing of that nature.</string>

<string>You know discussing nine eleven with people is an interesting phenomena. It's one of those things you have to know somebody pretty well to di in deep to your emotions. But let me just say this about my feelings of nine eleven. I was in Hawaii. I was one of the directors at the now a high performance computing center for the University of Hawai and my daughter called me and said Dad go to the TV there's a terrible thing happening in New York. So I got to the TV before the second tower was struck, and I watched all of that. I'd have to say the major impact on me was one of stirring of aggression. I like the old firehouse horse when he hears the alarm bell go off he charges to get ready to take the horse drawn fire engine to the fire site. I just wanted to go someplace and do something and wanted to be part of it. So my my first impression was one of of anger. How can anybody do that to us? And the second one was let's go get em. But late again and I think I have to know you like better than I know you do go much deeper than that about what I felt on that day.</string>

<string>When I was in the Marine Corps boot camp, they came and got at a  line one day and said you've got to go over to this other building and talk to this guy who we don't even know who he is but he's from the government wants to talk to you. And when they came back from that the guy asks me all kinds of questions about whether I was clearable and criminal record everything in my life that was embarassing. And I thought, well that's really strange was going on there. And when the workers came out our platoon commander which was an E seven gunnery sergeant in the Marine Corps read out orders he read out my orders I was ordered to school to learn twenty five seventy one divys and our platoon commander as an E seve, his major job in the Marine Corp was communications. So he'd hanedle the radios between different units in the Marine Corps and he got me aside and he said you're going to love this duty.  And little did I know how much I really was going to love it. When I finally get to the good lord and can talk to him,  I will say thank you lord putting me in that line of work. I loved every every every second of it. It was so exciting, was so intellectually challenging was, so much fun. And then I got out in civilian life, stayed with cryptology in the reserves. Lived out civilian life and bungered around out, I was a lawyer for ten years with my dad until he died. But I didn't like that very much. But I got back into computer research and again I felt something I'm really really loved. So I love computing. I love working on computers. I love envisioning what you can do with a computer. Something a lot of people don't have his vision they can do what they're told that they can't see. Wow, we could do this for that you know and so one of things I really love my job in academia is you're given an opportunity to talk about your vision, sell your vision and work on your vision, so those are all things I really love about both my military and my civilian careers.</string>

<string>The military in the United States is one of the full of benefit packages you can imagine. They give you housing and food when you were on base. They give you money to live a decent life. They they give you a good retirement plan with health coverage that you don't have worry about. They give you camaraderie. They give you recreation they give you time off. They give you moral support. %HESITATIO And they give you honor. The military, one the good things about the military see if you do a good job you don't just get an envoy from your boss they stand up in front of a group of people and give you a piece of paper or a ribon or a metal and say you did a good job you're really special. And that's got to make people feel better about themselves. So those are some of the benefits you get in the Navy or the Marine Corps or the Army or the Airforce. You know its of full benefit package they demand a lot of you. If you deploy later going to combat you're working twenty four hours a day seven days a week. You know there's no time where you can say no I don't want to do it. You just gotta get up and do it, but they eat they give back to you many fold.</string>

<string>No of course there is things in life that get kind of exaggerated and people who aren't in the field just don't really get a good feel what it's like. It's hard to say about the military, but I think one thing that gets romantisized is if you love the way people look in uniform. You look at the recruiting posters and they're the guys in there dress blue you know bell bottoms sailor uniform looking very athletic and and romantic in their Old World style. You get the wind listed in the officers in their dress uniforms you know just looking like a million dollars. They don't very often have too many posters showing your your work uniform So the entire life is not spent yeah you know where you dress uniform and going to parties. A chaplain told me once it almost every incident puts in for embassy duty when gets commission you don't get embassy duty until you're at the other end of your career, a commander or  a captain and so that that could be overly romanticize. How you can travel the world and become an embassy aid or something like that doesn't happened very much. But by and large, people understand. I think it's more the other way around what a high school kids think that everybody in the army runs around shooting people time. That you really you don't have that kind of pressure on you very often.</string>

<string>I think a major misconception about the Navy is that the leadership barking orders and being snotty to everybody. I feel like the Navy and to some degree in the Marine Corps are much more management oriented. Your commanding officer in the junior officers and the senior petty officers and senior NCOs over you are there to try to make your job useful and to keep you in good shape and your morale up. So I think it is a misconception that everybody in the military is marked net that just harsh treatment to end up high display there's a lot more it's more team spirit much more a quarterback in the huddle then the drill instructors screaming at you on the drill field and that's that's been my experience and I think a lot of people still make that mistake largely driven by movies who seemed invariably characterized lawsuits as stupid and malicious and evil and violent people and that's just not been my experience with</string>

<string>Each branch of the military has its own personality within them. The branches of the military have their own personality. The personality of the people in cryptology were different the personality of the guys we're in aviation. And they were different from the guys who were in the infantry units in the Marine Corps. But the marine corps has a personality that is largely let's figure out where we're going to and then let's go there come hell or high water. So the they're very very much let's get something happening and that's that differentiates from so many of the other services. Here the navy on the other hand, I think in their personality is largely we have huge complex and interdependent sets of equipment and systems on ships. And therefore we must be very technical. We must understand each other's jobs. We must know exactly what the other guy whose job is and how is equipment works. And we as best we can, we need to be able to fill in for him if he can't do his job. And so so that there's a kind of a almost a technical orientation the probably goes back to the good old days where you know the people who were allowed to go aloft and set to sales had to know what they were doing. They were just following directions they had to know how to sail a ship in order there was going to be big trouble. So there isn't a difference there. the airforce is oriented toward getting the pilots in the sky and recovered aircraft and that leads to kind of the separation of pilots and then the Russian airforce. But it's a separation of works well because everybody's place seeing together. The army is so diverse it's hard to see any single personality. But there is that solid feeling that,  "hey we are the guys who really gets the job done and make it happen,"  everybody else holds out you can drop bombs you could sales there in your ships. You know the Marines can help us get ashore,  but when it comes time to move across the land and we're the guys who have to get it done and so we are the guys you have to rely on.</string>

<string>Ssometimes issues raised what branch of the military is the right branch for me to enter. And that's a tough question the answer there so many factors that go into. One is your physical aggressiveness and physical talents. People in the Marine Corps you tend to be very physically aggressive and very athletic. And the Marines are looking for guys who were basically almost pro athlete kind of things. It's not to say the navy seals are any slouch either but the Navy as a whole doesn't focus so much on that kind of issue. So the marine corps is a good place to go if if you're really very competitive, aggressive, and athletic. On the other hand, the Navy is a good field going to if you're really into techno technical systems making the technical systems go together and you're carried away to some degree by the romance of the sea. And there is that romance for a lot of us and you'll you'll find that no matter where you go. The army's good place to go into if you have very specific requirements because the army has so many jobs that they can hit your job requirement. If you wanna be a truck mechanic and that's what you really wanted to do. I think the army would give you the best chance of getting into picking a specific field like that. Again though, if you if you're the athletics and competitive can be an army paratrooper and those guys crazy group of guys. The airforce is very good if you say, I want to fight my war in short sleeves you know I like doing technical stuff, I'm willing to take the risk, I don't want to be in a trench but I would be in the thick of the fight. One of the highest casualty rates in World War two was the eighth airforce, but they flew home every night if you flew home without getting killed. You flew home every night and you slept in your boat can get good food and you were safe for the night you know you didn't have to worry about love poor soldiers who were in the battle of the bulge standing up all in the freezing cold for fear of being overrun by the Germans. So the airforce is a different kettle of fish but very slow motion rates in the airforce sue they give me a good life I don't care what rank I might be a good good rules to go by if for airforce people.</string>

<string>I think the most common misconception about my STEM field is computer programming and computer research is frequently is seen as being one hundred percent devoted to writing computer code or working on computer machinery. But the fact of the matter is I don't know poll myself and kept track of this the vast majority of your time over your career is going to be reading and writing English. Not C++ or Fortran or Java. So you better get good at writing English so what other misconceptions is if I am a good Java  writer to find a good C programmer if I can knock off Fortran in my sleep I don't have to know English. Wrong you're gonna have to know English for a number of reasons that I can discuss later if you'd like. In the military one of the misconceptions about the military is that everybody in the military gets a rifle and ammunition and they go shoot at people even in the army that's not true. In the army, only one quarter of the people go to combat arms - infantry armor, paratroops and artillery are the the for combat arms. If you're one of the one in four who gets into combat arms chances are only one and two that you are having to do with the weapon. You know it's if you go on to armour for instance you're just as likely to be a fuel tone tray a fuel truck driver as you are to be a tank drive. So the army has a lot less people running around shooting people in the whole thing. You know we're already down to an eighth to the people you know half of those people who see combat that's sixteen and the people who see combat only have what we get to fire their weapons for one reason or another so that's one third it's only one thirty people in the army ever gonna fires weapons. And then you'll talk to guide the infantry got sent to Afghanistan so what about over their shot, but yeah but not everybody went to Afghanistan with him a lot of guys go to Afghanistan. I've known tons who never saw the enemy, they never got fireworks weapon anybody. So that's a major misconception that military school people go around killing people with a weapon. Nope.</string>

<string>looking at like two careers workday change significantly as I got more and more senior well let's start off with the military career I started out as a junior listed mail order everything I was doing was being somebody else told me he should go here go there to be there then do this and just so I just had to follow orders get about and the first two years of my time in the marine corps were spent in schools one kind or another so it's mainly just studying and eating and enjoying life my year in Vietnam I was on watch standing which means for eight hours every day of the week seven days a week I wasn't doing my linguistic duties and that was a different way to get through life when I got into the reserves in the military I start out again as a mid level in the person basically just taking training a life but then as I became an officer of the keyboard more someone who had organized and more Morgan who someone who had a right so I spent a lot of my time writing up players ready valuations writing up proposals training and getting ready for inspections and so my day buried as I got more and more senior to appoint right got where it was just almost always writing evaluations and running meetings of the only things I did by the time I got out in civilian life same kind of trend my day started out doing more technical things but then more and more got to be doing writing and playing visioning talking as as I went along silly day has changed in both cases</string>

<string>Both of the military and your civilian life you're gonna find a lot of times we have to move and that's going to change up things. One of the good things about being in the military if you like moving is that you're not stuck in one place for the rest your life and you're not stuck with one group of people you get to meet new people if you love people you get to meet new people you love if you don't love people you get to get away from the people you don't want. So it's it works out well both ways and when you move the military's particularly adept at accepting new people into the unit because there's always someone new coming into the unit and you remember when you're the new guy and how well you were treated or poorly then you try to treat the new guys that way too. So that's that's really good deal. In civilian life it's a little tougher when you move, because people some stick to one place and never move in their entire life but a lot of people do move around so one inside have had I would warn you about is most new guys when they get to the new place say wait a minute here's how we did in the old place and that work really well don't don't jump on that right away don't jump on that right away wait and maybe the way they do it in the new place works well for them and your only that you get it worked well for you guys would work so just peace you know get get in tune with the new way the way they do it and then then make a decision thing we can improve this little by borrowing this little thing from the old way. But that's that's moving brings up those issues.</string>

<string>I think the greatest whole work in the military is the camaraderie of the unit camaraderie that allows you to get through combat while she gets you personal loss, allows you to get through injury,  allows you to get through incredible stress and survive that's you see some of that in civilian life. You see some more of it in some kinds of civilian life like police work or firefighting well you get that kind kind of camaraderie but I think it's really a hallmark of the military. The other hallmarks of the military and in the American experience anyway as is the rotation system where you hardly ever any place longer than about two years. So things are always changing, you jobs changing. You work you're doing its changing, the kind of work you are doing is chaning. You're not just going to be a letter carrier for your entire years of life. My father in law did nothing but deliver the mail for the post office fourty years and he loved that. I think that I would not look I love the military where you'll be a linguist here you can go be a cryptanalyst there you go be a team leader here you can go be a unit leader there you can rise in rank you can go different places that kind of progression I enjoyed go back to it tomorrow if I had the opportunity.</string>

<string>When you're talking about different fields it's kind of hard to say what my field is exactly because I've done high performance computing research. So is it research my field or is high performance computing my field or is academia my field. So let me just speak generally about that in the same might be said about cryptology. I will see cryptologic linguist other people were Morse code operators other people were electronics experts other people studied radars in the walk so there are all kinds of different cryptologist but I think the the the civilian field I have which is high performance computing what is unique about it is we're always on the cutting edge because high performance computing doesn't say this is a high performance computer. It's kind of a loose definition high performance computer is the most powerful kind you have now is that the vector computer like the crates or is it like the Intel delta parallel computer or is it an accelerated computer using GPGUs general purpose graphics processing unit co-processers or is it one of the new quantum computers like we have here at USC. All those are high performance computers and so that's a unique part of that is it's a loose definition with a lot of different technologies it's always exciting always new and always on the cutting edge which means you got ten people said this is great to get the overall you got a hundred people over here saying well oh gosh not another set of empty promises you didn't deliver it last time and just go crazy about it. Cryptology thing that's unique about it is the most intellectual I think of all of the intelligence community.  The intellectual focus and the intellectual skills of the owner and the intellectual ascendancy that the US has in this area are just wonderful things to behold.</string>

<string>There are a lot of people in cryptology who have been great contributors to the field well you think of the Freidman,  Yardley, and Alan Turing. You know Joe were ushered just wonderful wonderful people they all had could have different personalities but the one mark that I think above all else struck with them was they're all tremendously smart when we're in Vietnam we were very proud of the fact that the intelligence tells the marine corps gave you to get into the service the score you got on that test acquired school would be in cryptology was higher free listing people then the test given OCS in McAllen off well you can be a very good officer and not be really terrifically Intel I mean you have to be significant above average but you don't have to be really a genius whereas to be a good cryptologist do you know the one smart did so I I think that's kind of one thing that set the cryptologist apart from when everybody else so I think the most you come into the service what effect could intellectual ability your chances of succeeding cryptology are fairly low beyond that I think it is a lot of enthusiasm has to do with it along that line you know do you get in the field say this really exciting IBM looking forward working on this are you get in the field like a I mean there was anyway I wanted to get a gun and shoot people then you're not you know that's somebody who I don't think you can get</string>

<string>When you're looking at different fields and what the priorities may be for people in those fields who might suceed, let me buy for keep my analysis into civilian on the one hand and military on the other. world I skin trade in which I work a major priorities bring your natural vision segment about the fuel to the problem can also bring an incredibly strong background theoretical and and applied mathematics a very good background in computer machinery that is you should be reading all the computer technical magazines regularly to see all the machinery is changing and they've been a wide knowledge of operating systems and programming codes because you didn't need to be able to understand immediately what's going to mesh well to create global in the field cryptology the priorities should be a wider understanding of people and history and I think that cryptologist no matter what field of cryptology there and neither why read full luminous tomes on history and sociology and people so that you have some understanding about who the people on the other side are that you're trying to analyze and then they have to know your specially field we must have to know the language and the T Branche have to know signals are being emmitted by various groups and then the communications need to know how to intercept people.</string>

<string>You know what you're looking at what's expected of you at work I have to say that I think my expectations of me were always higher than the expectations from people who were directing me. I think people who were directing me weren't driven as much as I was driven to do the kind of job that I thought needed to get done. I think that was always true I think it was also true but alot of the people for whom I worked especially the civilian life were not very good and particularly good with expectations and rarely set out here's what I really hope and you'll be able to do for me. And I think they knew what it was and I think they thought I knew what it was but because he never said I was never sure and I just did what I thought was the right thing to do and here I am.

<string>Failure is always a tough thing to face for all of us and in every field it's approach differently a lot of that is due to personality. The major thing in both my work as a cryptologist and as a an academic researcher is I work in cutting edge fields where there was a lot of failure you know it's more like baseball you know a good hitter only hits three out of ten times the other seven times he doesn't get very far. On-base pitted percentage might be a better example of that but you get the drift. I think failure is well accepted in both fields failure even the military of course I can be a mire failure you didn't defend your position well enough and therefore some untoward things happen or could be a major failure you failed in a way that resultants in somebody good getting killed and not achieving admission. So the one thing about the military is I think they're very forgiving of failure but all of the snow the failure might cause somebody's life, unnecessarily and that and many different things, but in terms of the management reaction to that kind of failure I think both academia and military were pretty good at saying we knew you were out on a limb you know if you fell off you fell off we're sorry but we will only get you.</string>

<string>I think most of us start out working in the field where we would like to think that we're gonna have an opportunity to improve yourselves and it grows human beings and that's a major call all of us. The military really does give you that opportunity and it sets out early on you know the day you enlist they give you and enlistment or a commission you know who the top dogs. They wear a different uniform they have different rank they get paid a different amount of money and you know that if you're gonna do the kinds of things you want to do you've got to get to all those senior ranks so I think I think in the opportunity to grow in those fields almost built into the military people know about it they're able to mentor you about it help and they are able to help you do tha. Civilian life especially academia's not quite so clear cut and it's not so often people will say well if you do this you can do that. For instance, if you go to work for a tenured professor on campus as a secretary the chance that you could ever become a tenured professor is next to zero you know it requires preparation and training you will never had and you can never really get there so the opportunities to grow vary depending on who your bosses and a lot of that's personality driven more than organizationally and I would say there's been a number of bosses I've had academia who really want to see me grow and then there's been a number of bosses who were just well you can if you want to go, but I am not going to go out of my way to make it happen.</string>

<string>When you talk about the environment you'll be facing once you get into a job that can vary all over the map both civilian and military life. In  military life I have done my technical tasks in a room full of electronic equipment in a carefully air conditioned and beautiful modern building with restrooms down the hall and a snack bar that I can get to easily and all the comforts of home. I've also done my job with a single radio and antenna in a tent in the cold weather in North America and I've also done my job in a bunker right on the DMZ in Vietnam where I was one of the few people in that area who even knew what I was doing for a living. So things change a lot of the military about the kind of technical environment you had in civilian life that technological environment in which I lived has always been a good one you know I've I've lived in modern buildings in modern offices stack of all the most modern equipment sometimes equiment so how off the press so to speak that nobody else in the world had that like the quantum computer we have here at USC there only two or three of those operational around the world we've got one of them so it it is been a joy to do that if you're in a smaller university or college of course it should be a little less plush but still very nice working and living conditions.</string>

<string>No matter what professional field you get into you will probably have a number of professional organizations they can be of assistance to you in doing your job and getting promoted. Sometimes these may be associations, professional associations, sometimes they may be sections of the military for instance they're in charge of getting you trained and educated to move up the ranks so you have to be alerted. So in my case I was able to move ahead in the military because there were a number of schools that were set up in their number of curricula set up that would encourage you to proceed further in cryptology about a lot of the work and if you could tell cryptology was personal study you know I could talk to you for hours about the history of cryptology and the military throughout the ages and and that was all part of my skill as a cryptologist. I also have studied a plethora of foreign languages so that when we were in Vietnam for instance I was to go to the linguist when somebody heavy foreign language they recognize they would bring it to me and say what languages is it and I would be able to tell not because that military training helped me learn that because my own private study had exposed me to those languages someplace where I can remember what they were like and that was that was useful. In the civilian world, the association of computing machinery (ACM) which is the major professional organization for people doing research in the computers and computer usage  and they've been very good about keeping me informed about what's going on what jobs are available. So find out what your field has for professional organization and join up you should do that. In the Navy, I belong to the Naval institute which publishes proceedings which is a monthly magazine discussing naval issues also important to me.</string>

<string>Risk taking is always part of any employment or any career path and you need to be alert to those and you need to analyze them carefully. To some degree the degree of risk will be dependent on your personality but on the some people like my father in law who did the same thing, many of us don't like any kind of change some of us like the excitement of trying new things and going to new places you can do operator in that field so you have to decide on your own how much risk you want to take but in virtually every fields the people who get ahead the most will be those who can analyze and take the right risk when it's time to take them. Those who get ahead by avoiding risk and just doing their job even if they get promoted may not have the sense of satisfaction that those who push the envelope right to the edge got from their job.</string>

<string>One of the things you find out in life is not just the money you make it's the your sense of what you did that made a difference in the world that will determine whether you consider your career a success or a failure. In the military, the work I did, cryptology, there are numerous examples in history about the effect of cryptology. The work from World War two were probably the most at stake was the fact that the US solve the Japanese naval codes in World War two allowed them to predict exactly what the Japanese were planning to do for the battle of midway and ambush the Japanese fleet, thereby sinking a huge number of Japanese carriers, I think three or four carries with some fair along with their pilots in airplanes and made it such that the Japanese never could replace, probably the major turning point in World War two in the Pacific. In the Atlantic, our ability to break because the Germans were using to station their submarines allowed us to win the war by keeping the sea lanes open to Great Britain so that's been a big difference. In computing, supercomputing, and academia clearly you know we were the ones rocking and rolling in the computer field so I feel like we're changing the world every day.</string>

<string>I don't think your lifestyle will change much if you're in the navy, basically speaking the navy is not Big Brother it doesn't get in everything you do if you're on board a ship or with a small group of people in a small unit, you must learn to get along with everybody and adopt the mores of group you don't want to be the odd man out all the time. So to some degree you may learn to curb your tongue a little if you're on board but that's true and academic life as well. There are political stances that most academics take that not everybody at the table takes, but one learns to keep your own counsel and and get along so lifestyle changes you need to make in both academia and the navy are modest compared to what you might think they would be.</string>

<string>Actually my favorite book of all time is one I recommend everyone thing about going the service. It is The Caine Mutiny by Herman Walk because it gives a better description about what navy life is like and where your loyalties must lie and what the possibilities are that anything else I've ever read. An excellent book The Cain Mutiny if you don't have time to read the entire book watch the movie the movie's kind an abbreviated version but it gets the  same point across pretty well.

<string>Maybe a little surprising to you that the most famous person world that I would like to meet and spend some time with is not a military person of all considering the fact I'm so enthusiastic about naval and military affair, but it is a musician. Sir James Galway is probably the best known classical flutist in the world and he prefers flutist not flautist and I would like to spend some time with him because he's a very convivial Irishman and I love convivial Irishman I'd love to spend sometime with him breaking Irish whiskey and I'd like to talk him about music and how somebody like him can have such a certified musical capability and somebody like me be so lacking in musical ability but love it so much anyway.</string>

<string>Over my adult life almost every job I had to be very personally satisfying. Back for my start working on the call growing up pikes peak all the way through to my last job as an academic for the University of Southern California, I felt like I was doing that important and interesting and constructive work and just have really enjoyed all of it of course my time in the military was my best times of my life and if I had one you live over again it would be my year in Vietnam and I just felt very satisfied about my contribution to what we're trying to do there and so my satisfaction comes from just being part of the team, doing really good work, and enjoying each other while we're doing it.</string>

<string>I think when you're looking at cryptology the military and trying to get into cryptology the people who try to get you in this field will be the military recruiters and what they'll be looking for is very good test scores some demonstrated capability in academics that is a good academic record and a capability of following the rules to be in cryptology you must be a rule follower you can have a lot of adventure in your soul but if you think the rules are for somebody else you belong somewhere else because of classification issues.</string>

<string>Every career field has its problems and its issues. The major problems I see and cryptology day are the consistent and destructive leaks because we are not doing a good job of clearing our people giving too many people clearances who don't have any affection for or loyalty to the United States and they see their life is somehow separate and above the life of the nation until we can solve that problem knowing when the nation be at risk but those practicing the feeling cryptology will find their work being completely trashed by selfish ego centric people. In academia, the major problem we have is that students are less and less inclined to take the hard choices and go to difficult fields like engineering, math, and computer science.</string>

<string>When you're looking at people in your life you admire they seem to fall into a number of different classes, people who are historical figures who live in the past, people who are living today of, people who you know only through the newsreels, and people you know personal. So it's hard to come down with a single person that I can say I admire them the most. My previous boss at USC was a person I admire greatly, he was a very thoughtful and very pragmatic academic, he was not an ivory tower guy he understood how the world really worked. He was brilliant and came from a professorial family and had a lot of achievement in high performance computing, I had a tremendous amount of admiration for him. He was also professional quality of baseball players until his arm gave out as a pitcher, super guy nice guy fun to be with new every topic you want to talk. Outside of that in cryptology I guess I have to say one of my heroes was Joe Rochefort historically he's the man who was in Honolulu and helped break the Japanese codes in World War two. In academia, one of my favorite people was my first boss at Caltech, Doctor Paul Messina he's now at Argonne National Laboratories a very intelligent fellow born in Sicily raised his Panama and educated in United States always fun to be with a gentleman of the first order I appreciate gentility as well.</string>

<string>Well hard to think of a funny story in terms of a joke, but I'll tell you one that's a good joke on me. We were standing watch one night on the outside perimeter line around in Phu Bai, Vietnam and I was there was an army staff sergeant and another marine corps sergeant and the army staff sergeant regular ran the bunker and the other sergeant and I were just there helping out that night in the army staff sergeant dog started barking, so we thought maybe there was some Vietcong or North Vietnamese army people who had gotten through the wire and were out of the field where the dog was barking so we said well I guess we gotta go out and check so the only thing I had with me that night was my M1911 A-145 automatic pistol and the army sergeant had an M16 so we were about a hundred meters one direction from the bunker and I was a hundred meters in the other direction so here I am standing out in this field about knee high grass of while the sergeant who stayed in the bunker called one of the arms bunkers the shooting bunkers out on the perimeter line and told to fire a pop up flares, so there's a little rocket propelled flare that goes whoosh and then as a flare so you see can see and I'm standing out there in the grass waiting for this flare to go off hoping that I do the right thing if we went off all all of a sudden it occured to me that I had was this nineteen eleven was seven rounds in the magazine all I had was seven bullets from a handgun I suppose what happens with a far off that flare of a whole company of Vietnamese soldiers stand up from the middle of the grass and they've all got rocket propelled grenade launchers and I sat there and I sat there sat there and then it got tense quiet and finally the flare went off. I must have almost jumped about three feet straight in the air when that sucker went off so if there was a VC in the grass, I would not be able to see him because I was up way up in the air when that's didn't see anybody stood out there for another couple minutes to make sure it in here but he tried to get through the grass away from me we went back to the bunker later on that day we saw the dark bog barkinh at another dog somewhere down on the fence line and so we think that's what the dog was barking at the previous night so that's to me that was pretty funny when I come to think of it.</string>

<string>I have a lot of sympathy for people who don't do well in school I was a terrible high school studen, my high school adviser told me I had good test scores but I was no achievement and I would never amount to anything after two years of college the University of Colorado the dean asked me to go away for a couple years, I went into the Marine Corps when I came back I did a lot better I'll tell you that for sure, so I've I've known about struggling in school I think growing up helps a lot if you've got intellectual capability but you are having trouble getting your nose to the grindstone tour the service, a kind of arduous duty of any kind I think would be good advice for you because you need more than just a well I'm gonna change you need something that's really going to change you.</string>

<string>There were a couple of problems going through any group there are bullys in every group and the bully will always target the people who he thinks he can bully the easiest this makes it tough on everybody I've never been on the aggressive fighter never been particularly athletic so I've been the target of a lot of bullies in my life. You know it's hard to put up with it but hardly ever fatal or hardly ever leads to any kind of permanent injury, I think organizations should be alert to bullying and take care of it better, but for individuals I think the best thing to do is just look inside yourself, think about what's bothering you think about whether it really matters, often the bully is relying on the fact you'll be embarrassed to have been pushed around by somebody and if you don't care I can laugh off or make a joke about it often they'll go away and leave you alone god help you if you've been bullied if I'm around let me know I'd help you to.</string>

<string>I think you should be prepared to go to college and I don't think I was very well prepared college I had very few instructors who drove me to do the kinds of work I was able to do I think to some degree a lot of the instructors I had a high school weren't aware of the kind of work I could do, so I think it's kind of difficult to say what you need to do to get ready to go to college but I think the most important thing is you have to learn to think not just regurgitate what you've been told, but think and analyze think and analyze argue it out with your friends take a position that you don't even like and see if you can convince them your position is correct and learn to write an articulate your ideas.</string>

<string>The importance of resumes so often discussed and I'm not so sure that it is that critical frequently people analyze resumes and try to say you should emphasizes this deemphasize that, but I think once you get the basics down make sure you list all of your qualifications what your record is, everything is provable and you can stand by it think that's about what you wanna do you wanna may spend some time on a cover letter that goes with the resume but by and large I think you know people are not looking for something on a resume that will select you they're looking for is a lack of something on a resume that'll keep you from getting selected and that's things like we need a guy with a bachelors degree and this guy doesn't have a bachelors degree so as long as you can meet the qualifications are looking for and I think the quality of school you went to make a lot of difference if you get an opportunity to publish a paper was somebody make sure you do that and then you have that put on your resume as well I published A, B, and C article and such and such a journal and that looks good.</string>

<string>If you're looking for an internship I think one of the best places to work is to go to your counselor either and I school or college and ask them if they've got a good list of local internships are available other than that you know the firms in the schools that are close to you doing research in like and do you should you know get on board with them that do a Google search or Yahoo search or whatever search engine you life and and start looking for internships in your area not relying on your counseler you want to ask them don't don't just accept everything they say a little searching all help and if you know a professional in that field you might ask them who in your field gets good internship how to get a hold.</string>

<string>When it comes to picking the right career field there are two important things listen to this is the most important they'll say to you all day two important things first know whom you are know who you are what do you love to do, say well I love to play video games nobody's going to pay me to do that, what does it mean? I love to work with computers. I love competitiveness. I love trying to achieve things. I love working inside. You know there break down what it is you really love to do. Every day I do it every day, I love it everyday I never get tired of it I can't go to sleep at night because I enjoy I love writing English. I love writing code. I love doing mathematics. Omar Bradley general Omar Bradley in World War Two when the war was about to overcome him swamp him was pressure he would do calculus to relax there's a guy who's loved calculus so figure out where it is you like to do and figure out the broad area what you like to do I like to be with people I like to talk I like to be alone I'd like to work with numbers you know get that then figure out what field does that what field us at every day not what they show on the movies not what they show in the movies the movies and TV have a caricature of real professions are like, quick example if I say lawyer to you ninety percent of you will think of a guy standing in front of the jury saying, "My friends, my clients are   innocent" lawyers spent less than one percent of their time arguing to a jury there was the time they're in offices interviewing people interviewing witnesses or writing documents or doing research in books you know that's a completely different life than what they show on TV so get a hold somebody who does this for a living and ask them what do you do during the week every day you go to work what is your day like and if that's something you enjoy doing then that's the right career feel for you.</string>

<string>you may be wondering what you should do if you're uncertain about the future that's a toughie I remember when I was a high school junior I really didn't have any idea I don't want to go to college because everybody's going to college go to college I certainly never thought I want to be a cripple logic officer yeah I never thought I want to be a lawyer I want to be an academic and study high performance computing I never thought so I don't know what do you do if you have no draw I've do you know what you want to do just get a broader taste of life is you the military will give you a very broad taste of life and they give you to select like you did me putting me in cryptology that I never would've thought up but they said we figure because I was good at and what so get a broad taste of life I think that's a critical one last quick war story my eldest brother from the tiny was in junior high school wanted to be a veterinarian anyone to work on large farm animals and he wanted to work in a small town in the rocky mountain somewhere didn't care where the rocking that's all I wanted to so I went to the university of Illinois and got a degree and he went to the university of Illinois better in medical school and got a degree it's harder to get that that's cool Illinois than it is in the medical but he wanted to do that and they went to Wyoming and he became a large animal veterinarian in a small town we will Wyoming in the Rocky Mountains Andy hade he hated it anyone any good he was he was a good veterinarian anyone any good lovingly better day investments because running the veterinarian business is ninety percent being a salesman in being nice to people and being friendly and being people kind of a jovial guy that everybody got along he hated five years later quit and he went to work for a bunch of large firms that did research and better medical products and before you know it he lived in New York City on the East River doing basically legal work getting legal registration for better a medical drugs around the world after drug got registered in the U. S. to treat hoof and mouth disease that he'd go around the world if the other come countries to them recognize our rights to yeah he was basically a lawyer yeah that's what he did the rest of his life and he hoped it was fun exciting travel yeah completely different than what you want so you know what you want to do right now may be way off base</string>

<string>as you're making her choice number people you wanna talk to my experience has been people who really should be the best you will talk to frequently let you down the vice I got from high school counselors from I was not productive and in retrospect the people I should have been talking to our professionals in the field I should have talked to people who did it for a living and said what is this work like and that would have been a good thing to do is talk to people like that the other thing good to do would be to talk to somebody who does not have a dog in the fight a military recruiter frequently has on his recruiting criteria the people he needs to recruit this month so he may try to talk you into being in a field that you really heart right for but it's gonna satisfy us to be careful about that but by and large the best people to talk to are the people who are in the field and try to find people of fields we love it and those who hated because they'll give you two different stories and you really need both stories before you can make a choice</string>

<string>All the jobs I've had, had some kind of challenge involved in them. Those challenges range across the whole spectrum of human endeavor. Sometimes the challenges are intellectual- understanding high level mathematical concepts involved in practicing law or new high performance computing research, or in the military, decrypting the varying kinds of communications can be challenging in a way. But I think that things that stick out most in my mind in terms of challenges are working with people- the most challenging thing you have to do is learning how to work most effectively with the team and make sure the team remains cohesive and goal directed. And if you can do that you can overcome virtually everything if you lose either cohesion or goal direction, then the team is just treading water and the morale goes in the tank and the danger goes up. So to me the most challenging thing is optimizing people and the team.</string>

<string>In both the fields in which I work in my life the biggest barrier to entry is intellectual capability. The marines in Vietnam were very proud of the fact that isn enlisted men in cryptology, our test requirements were higher than the test requirements for people who wanted to go to officer training school and become officers, so that was one level. The second level was the clearance a lot of young people growing up having a good time sowing there wild loads, you know what everybody's doing it too, and a lot of them wind up with something on their record that will prevent them from getting a clearance in the future. It's true when I was coming through this line of work and it's still true today and it's true to some degree about academia as well. You know you you need to have a good record of accomplishment and not a record of misbehavior.</string>

<string>My interest in the military's been with me for my entire life. I came from the family that started out in the military to some degree my father was in World War two when I was born. He was a navy officer and was working with Strangelove PT boat engines, another technical field. He was an officer in the in the spotlight core and was procuring PT boat engines. My eldest brother was in the Korean War briefly and my youngest brother did twelve years on submarines as a submarine officer. So there's always been an interest in the military and I can remember early in grade school being interest in reading books about the military. Not serious tones there was an author called Fletcher Pratt who wrote a lot of stories about the military, historical books, not really about the military but aimed at young people</string>

<string>From the time I was in junior high school is very interested in electronics, so I mastered electronics back when the lot of electronics were still tube orientated, long before transistors. And then we got into transistors and I was interested always through, and when they got in the military I got into a line of work that involved a lot of technology, that is cryptology. I worked with a lot of electronic gear- maintaining and repairing and optimizing as we went along. So that was very useful to me. When I got out of the military I when I first started back in college they were offering some introductory courses in computer programming and this was brand new in computers because there were those times kinds of things before that. But when I got out of the marine corps went back to university of Colorado where the first courses I took was a course in fortran four and I was writing programs on one of Seymour Cray's early supercomputers, a CDC five hundred and I've been interested in computers ever since.</string>

<string>Many people in life choose a career early in their life my oldest brother in high school decided that he wanted to be a veterinarian and have a large animal veterinary practice in the small town in the rocky mountain west. He grew up in Illinois went to university of Illinois got a degree in chemistry, then got admitted to veterinary medical school which in Illinois is harder to get into the medical school is and got a DVM and became a veterinarian moved we will Wyoming and lasted exactly five and a half years. He hated it, he couldn't do it he was there that he was a wonderful veterinarian but he wasn't good at the the personal part of being a veterinarian. So he left that and went to work for a number of large organizations that were doing research and he wound up not only doing research, but he finally wound up living on the east river in New York City working for two different large firms- Pfizer and Ciba - doing drug registration internationally. So when the new drug was produced by one of those firms for veterinary use, he would go to these foreign countries and figure out how to get the license so it can be sold there. So basically what he wound up doing was something was more legal work than veterinary medical work. How did I choose my career, unlike my oldest brother I just kind of waltzed into it I got picked for cryptology by the marine corps and loved it. I practiced law with my dad for a few years did like that very much. Went back to academia and I've loved it in academia. And I'm in academia largely because the navy reserve buddy of mine no what have you once said what it's going to work for us it might merit in doing research and that's where I got started with Martin Marietta and then I got hired by Caltech, fom mark Marietta. So sometimes life just takes care of you and it certainly took care of me</string>

<string>I frequently say that god treats me better than I deserve. It is certainly true I've been happy with virtually every career ahead except for practicing law. My time in the service were the best years of my life. The absolute best year in my life ever was my year in Vietnam and my time and academia has just been a riot, I do enjoy it, pay has been decent, I've raised a family, educated three daughters and I when I go to meet my maker I will be in full thanks for the life he has given me</string>

<string>You know I think of the things that's true about high school is, when it comes to athletics there is a focus on the top ten percent of the class that is really good at some athletics. The varsity team players and not much else. I'm not particularly athletic and so there were no sport I particularly cared for. I played a little basketball because I'm tall and six six, but I can't run so I didn't like that very much didn't play the other team sports and so they just drift through life. As a young adult I found out about volleyball turns out and I'm a very good volleyball player. I even got accused of being a semi pro once during a volleyball match in the navy. So I can't say I'm very good at anything but I certainly did enjoy volleyball and if I was in charge of the world, I would change the way we do athletics in high school. I'd try to help everybody find a sport in which they could excel and play with joy instead of just paying attention to the varsity athletes and everybody else has to do calisthenics.</string>

<string>There's a series of questions about favorites that always kind of puzzle me. And the one the puzzles me the most is what is your favorite color. I don't have a favorite color, I can't imagine you would have a favorite color. I like combinations of colors I like all colors. Some colors look better sometimes than other colors. So favorite color doesn't makes sense to me, I guess that's a gene I got that I'm missing the ability to have a favorite color because most people will come up with something, and I just I don't know what to tell you about favorite colors</string>

<string>When I was in language school in Washington DC, I was taking Vietnamese and the Vietnamese all spoke French as a second language and they preferred French because French is a much richer and and intellectual language than Vietnamese. Vietnamese is an agricultural language and doesn't have a lot of subtlety to it, so they all spoke French. So they hired a young woman who had just gotten a degree in French from the university of Maryland to speak French to the Vietnamese and she was almost six feet tall, and as I was six six my marine corps "oh that one's yours, Davis". So we corresponded, everybody else got dear John letters in Vietnam, all I got was chocolate chip cookies and one bottle of wine she smuggled through the mail to me, that worked out pretty well. So when I got out I married her and this last August we've been married forty six years.</string>

<string>I grew up in the nuclear family of a father who was a lawyer, a mother who ran the beauty school, and three brothers. My eldest brother was twelve and a half years older than I was, and recently passed away. He was a veterinarian and worked for large drug companies most of his life. I had a brother just took two and a half years older than I was, he has an MBA from the university of Chicago and worked at a drug company in Illinois - Abbott laboratories - doing management for his entire career. And then I have a younger brother who is five and a half years younger than I am, who went out to the ROTC program at Duke University and was a naval sub officer for twelve and a half years until his wife told him "if you go to sea one more time I won't be here when you come back", so he quit after twelve and a half years as Lieutenant Commander</string>

<string>I'm six feet six inches tall so there's no food in the world that I don't like. I didn't get this tall not eating I can tell you that for sure, so I like food in general. So my favorite food I guess if I had to pick would be a lobster, because traditionally that's what I've always liked and when I really want to celebrate something I go get a lobster.

<string>At two hundred thirty five pounds it's hard for me to think that I have any least favorite foods. I like eating even though I'm six six, two thirty five is a little on the heavy side but I eat almost everything. Least favorite probably could steamed vegetables almost any kind. I love raw vegetables but once you cook them and they get kinda soft I don't like them much anymore. And the food I never would try or the Philippine balutes, a balute is fertilized egg with the fertilized embryo inside, so little unborn baby chicken, the egg they ferment until it's half rotten then eat it. They're wonderful I never have had one but given the opportunity I think I'd probably pass</string>

<string>You know where things always heard growing up was army food is terrible that people complain about army food all the time. So yeah in the marine corps and I started getting the food the food was great. Jeez, I've really enjoyed the food they fed me. People in boot camp gain weight the food was so good, of course that was put on muscle not fat but it was good and I liked it. Then when I went to Morse code training I went to navy base the food down there was wonderful. I mean was was good and plentiful and healthy and I enjoyed it. And then I went to language school was on a navy base we had good food up there too, and that that was alright. And then I went to my first army base, and the food was... We were in Vietnam and the food was not so hot. And then the first year came and new year's day they give this roast beef and everybody who eat roast beef new year's day in the army Chow got some terrible ill and I ate roast beef and I was sick as I ever been in my life. It was terrible, I mean a whole group of us in my watch section were so sick except the guys who for one reason or other had not eaten the roast beef. But they can be forgiven that was a combat zone, so what do you expect. So then I went to Thailand and because the way the watch section was going, we we usually ate hamburgers in the club or we went downtown Thailand and ate. We didn't eat in mess hall very much. And then everybody in the base start getting sick and they couldn't figure iut what it was, and the CO was going to cancel liberty because he said "you're getting sick from going down and eating Thai food" and somebody pointed out to him "you know the guys who don't eat in the mess hall and the guys who didn't get sick" I didn't get sick and they found out that the mess cook can't overlook the fact that the Thai workers in the scullery had decided that it was too hot in there, but if you turn off the steam valve to the steam sterilizer for me in the room a lot cooler. So with that kind of a lukewarm temperature trying to do the sterilization, people got very ill. So that was another army base so maybe it's just army food, but the other food I had was wonderful</string>

<string>When I was in the sixth grade we moved from Illinois where I grew up to Colorado springs. And so from the sixth grade through the end of college I was a native of Colorado. In Colorado there was a lot of empty space for shooting and so I have shot in the hundreds my entire life. Small game big game birds and the like. So I am in inveterate a shooter one of my best buddies in high school hand loaded his own ammunition for a big bore rifle so we fired big bore rifles all the time. In the military I was allowed to fire tremendous number rounds for qualification in practice, and in Vietnam I was in the M16 machine gun or so I got to test fire that machine gun and and burned up a lot of ammunition through that. So I have a shot still like to shoot but I live in Los Angeles now so don't get much opportunity to shoot much anymore even though I still have a number of weapons</string>

<string>Whenever you dress uniform you see above the left breast pocket the the series of ribbons that are typically the top band of the ribbon that holds the metal that goes with that particular honor, and those ribbons tell a lot about who you are and what you've done and where you've been Because I am a cryptologist and not a hero, the senior ribbon that I have is the marine corps good conduct medal which means I did my job and didn't cause trouble. I had the national defense medal which means I was in the armed forces during the Cold War. I have the Vietnam service medal of which means I did a year's tour in Vietnam and has little stars honored for each campaign I was part of, I have 4. Then I have a couple of medals for the travel and oversee studio I did when I was a reservist, a ribbon that indicates how much time I did reserve duty, and then I have three awards from the Republic of Vietnam civic action metal, the gallantry cross medal, and the Vietnam campaign medal. And they were given to me because of the units I was in in Vietnam, and then I have one last ribbon which is the US navy expert rifleman ribbon, a permanent one because I fired experts three times and once you do that they think if you're that good you you don't have to keep five</string>

<string>When I was in the military got a chance to go overseas quite a bit. I did a year in Vietnam. And during that year in Vietnam I was given the opportunity to do two R and Rs. Rest and relaxation, and those were one week tours, one to Australia and one to Japan. Then when I went back to the states almost immediately I was given opportunity doing augmentation tour to help out the army linguist who were stationed in northern Thailand a place called Udorn Tanay, just south of Vientiane Laos. And so I was put on a plane and we flew to Taiwan, and we flew from Taiwan to Hong Kong, and we flew from Hong Kong to Bangkok, spent a couple days in Bangkok, and then flew up country to Udorn Tanay, where I spent three months and spent quite a bit of time out on the economy, that is traveling around locally in Thailand. And one day we got a special opportunity to go up to the Mekong river and sail up and down the Mekong river on one of the motor boats run up and down the Mekong. When they got in the reserves most of my duty was stateside but I had six tours overseas. One of those tours was Naples Italy where I spent almost three weeks doing augmentation tour. I spent two weeks in London, I did another two weeks in London and then spent three tours in northern Japan, Northen Honshu in Japan at a place called Misawa. So I've been overseas quite a bit, also spent about a week in Okinawa coming and going to Vietnam. Have not been station other than that overseas</string>

<string>Crimes the military almost identical to the crimes you find in civilian life but the level of crime criminal activity is much reduced. It always is amazing to people to find out that the murder rate for instance in Vietnam was almost nonexistent. Everybody had a weapon, everybody had a weapon with ammunition, everybody was had orders to carry the weapon with ammunition all the time, and yet they did shoot each other. The few murders that happen in Vietnam were fraggings, that is throwing a hand grenade in to somebody, usually a senior officer, or enlisted person. And a lot of that was racially motivated. So the crimes are not that different than the civilian life but they they're less of them probably because people with really serious criminal activity are not allowed to enlist. Then you have the additional crimes that you don't have in the military that do make up a lot of issues in the military. UA, unauthorized absence. Awol, you know stay out too long without leave, desertion, you know all those things that come about and are already crime in the military that do make up a lot of the activity in the criminal justice</string>

<string>As a junior enlisted person, while most people in the marine corps and the navy lived in open bay barracks, that is you live in one fairly large room with anywhere from twenty to fifty bunks in it.  Frequently the bunks were double deckers, that is there was somebody be the upper bunk and somebody lower bunk sometimes they were single level. Then when you make a NCO level, used to be with then you'd get and one or two man room, and then as you got to be a very senior enlisted you would get a reasonable suite to live in. Although senior listed frequently got married and we're living in married quarters or off camp. So they were all pretty decent. Now of course when you're a combat zone you might be on the field some living in tents, depending on if you're one of the services that does that sort thing. Like the air force doesn't do that very much, and the navy doesn't do that very much, but there were navy linguists with me and Kontin, up in the DMZ. where we were living in bunkers. There was a navy corpsman that was up there with this I stepped on this great big engineering spike that went all the way through my foot, stuck out the top and there was a navy corpsman right there to give me a booster shot of tetanus, and and laughed with me about a stupid thing that was to step on that spike. But living quarters typically for cryptologist was very good</string>

I was not at all volunteer service, the bonusprogram started after that, so I don't have very good knowledge of how the bond system worked.

<string>One of the best features the military is the ability to retire at an early age, if you're active duty you can retire after just twenty years of service occasionally eighteen and a half. The service really thinks it's to the other good the service to let you go then. And at that juncture usually get about half your base pay but none of your housing allowances, then you get medical benefits for the rest your life that is anytime you get to a military hospital will take care of you, if you get to the civilian doctor there's something called tricare, that pays kind of like insurance. So you can be taken care of. If you're a reservist the retirement benefits don't start when you retire, they started age sixty. So you have to wait until age sixty before you can retire. And that's still a pretty good deal because at age sixty, then you get a fraction of what the active duty people get, depending on how much drilling you did and how often you went on active duty, you know the like. They have a formulated a calculator that comes up with some portion, but it's it's a nice little stipend that goes longer. So security from your school and work, that is makes it up. It's worthwhile retiring and at age sixty you get the tricare if you want it or if you close to a military base you can go there for medical care as well</string>

<string>The hiring process is a difficult one for me to describe with any certainty because I've gone through several and none of them I think has been standard. In almost every case someone inside of the organization to which I was being hired knew about me had asked me to join up with that organization, the only difference would have been the when I joined the marine corps in that case I just went and talked all 4 military recruiters, Air Force army navy and marine corps, and basically ask them who will guarantee me a chance go to Vietnam. And the marine corps was the ones who said "yeah if you join up you're going to Vietnam" so that's all there is to it. But when I went into lawm after I got out of law school at new practice with my father who had practiced in Colorado springs for years, so there wasn't any hiring process there, just and work with them. And when he passed away I, you know, exactly what you saw was still practicing law in one of my good friends from the reserve unit where I was working said "you know I know you're not happy practicing law but why don't you join mark Marietta and work for us on this technical project that requires the kind of clearance you have". And so I said "well that's pretty good I'll do that". So I went there. And then another friend of mine from the, at mark Marietta who's also reservist said "you know they need somebody out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Mark Marietta to work out there went you see if they'll transfer you out there", because my wife loves the ocean I thought well that's good will go to Los Angeles and then she'll be able to go to the ocean more. So I got that job because somebody suggested. And while I was at JPL, a project came up that we were kind of briefed on, and we were working on, and fellow who was in the project was the head of the high performance computing center at Caltech, and he kinda liked me, so he said "Dan, why don't you quit working at JPL for mark and other income work for Caltech and help me run this supercomputing centers". So I became the assistant director there, again a friend, and then on my own kind of I got to know some people at University of Southern California and one of them said, "why don't you come to university of Southern California, we'll pay you more than cal tech does", which is always an inducement. And so I did that and that worked out fine. And then some people who knew me asked me to come try to get the high performance computing center for the university of Hawaii, and I did that so I worked out there for awhile and that that also was kind of fun. And we got to got to do that, so I didn't really have a hiring process in any of those I just kind of somebody grease the skids for me and I got right in.</string>

<string>Other than the service, I got virtually no initial training for any of the jobs. I learned what I learned in college I learned what I learned from getting through life and I apply those lessons. A lot of the other training I've done, I've done on my own and I it's stood me in good stead so far. Virtually all the computer programming I know I've learned by buying a book and doing it that way. That was even true in the practice of law to some degree, the biggest case I ever won in the practice of law was a jury trial and I just bought a book on how to try this particular kind of case it was a criminal felony, how to try criminal felonies in a jury trial and I read the book and I did it, and we won. So a very interesting way to get through life. Of course most corporations and universities have some kind of introductory training, but they basically speaking they just as soon get hit the ground with your feet running and then you'll be off after the real goals.</string>

<string>Marine corps boot camp was one of the most challenging things I've ever done in my life I'm not very athletic and later on in life I found out that hypothyroid which means I didn't develop a lot of upper body strength and muscle mass when I was growing up. So boot camp was a real challenge for me because you get a lot of P. T. you ran everywhere you're constantly being harassed by the drill instructors . You had a lot to learn, but I'm pretty smart so I learned pretty fast they try to put a lot of pressure on this but I was older than mostly kids in boot camp I was in my early twenties most of them are like eighteen or so so I handle that kind of screaming and yelling better than they did, didn't make a difference to me what that drill instructor called me, I kind of thought the profanity was kind of funny. But boot camp is one part of the military that you're glad you did and you're glad it's behind you, and glad you don't have to do again.</string>

<string>I think the most important people to talk to if you're interested during the military are people you can trust who are in the military who'll give you good data. do not take their analysis in the military correctly. They will sometimes do you the wrong direction, if they didn't like it you'll be able to perceive that very quickly. If they didn't like it listen to it and think "oh here's what a person who didn't like it will tell you" and try to find somebody who did like it to give you the other side of the story. So this is critical to me, don't just go by what one person tells you to talk to several people with several different views. When I was commanding officer of the navy reserve unit occasionally we'd get people want to join our reserve unit, and I generally would try to get them a chance to talk to somebody who really loved it and another one of th guys who really didn't care for it much it was going to get out after he served his tour. That would give the best chance to find out what was really like. But listen carefully, intermalize what people say and ask factual questions, well he didn't like it, "what was it like?" "what did you do?" "what you do every day?" "what was that like?" "is that what they did the following day?" You don't try it trying to pin them down because otherwise you get their kind of political opinion about it, rather than how they felt. It's amazing to me how many people I've talked to in the military said I hated my time there. I ask "where were you stationed and what were you duties and what did you do for fun?" And after you talked a little while I've had two or three of them say to me you know now that I think about it I really did have a pretty good time. You know so listen listen critically but talk to everybody, and then go talk to every recruiter you can and listen critically they're trying to talk you into joining their service what what are they saying that you can take with a grain of salt and where they say you can take to the bank</string>

<string>Attire in the navy has changed some since I was on active duty. Used to be you had to wear your dress uniform a lot more than you do now it used to be against regulations to run around and your utility a work uniform, now everybody seems they camouflage work uniforms or just the berries and they wear them all the time they wear them in downtown. So things things change, I am currently wearing the shirt to dress blue uniform over which you typically wear the blue coat double breasted brass buttoned blue coat. But it in an office setting you take them off and just have your raw shoulder boards showing your rank, in this case I'm a commander that has three stripes, and a star showing that I am an on-officer that is I'm a fighter, not the staff officer like a chaplain or a lawyer jag corps, or medical corps, dental corps, Pleiku, or those sorts of things are considered staff office</string>

<string>I'm a great student of military history and naval history I enjoy reading about it. I think it's critical, I think it's something everybody should know. One of the things you find out about military or the navy is it is absolutely vital that people are where they're supposed to be when they're supposed to be there. If you're in the middle of the battle and you're expecting some unit to appear at some time to relieve you from pressure from that direction, and they don't appear, people will die. And so you start off with the military that says let's inculcate a tradition of when the commanding officer says "I want you at that place at that time" you're there then. I have often told young people going in the military you'll never get in a really really bad trouble if you where you're supposed to be when you're supposed to be there. If you're in the wrong uniform they may scream at you, if you don't have your weapon ready day may scream at you, if you don't have the equipment you need, somebody may be upset with but if you're there when you're supposed to be there somebody will find some use for you, and they will not think ill of you. So that's why the military adheres to tight schedules and why you would be well served if you get on board with that theory and do what you're supposed to do when you're supposed to do it.</string>

<string>When I enlisted in the marine corps, you only had two choices; you did very well on the way entry test, even the recruiters office you could pick aviation options. That meant you're for sure you would not go in the infantry, you'd go in an anaviation option of some kind or another. These days things have changed entirely, the different services have different ways of testing you ahead of time and can guarantee you occupational field. So I'm not exactly sure how that works so I would urge you to talk to your recruiter about that and don't put up with "well yeah I'll usually or frequently, or maybe, you know" what are they guaranteeing you is going to happen. You can't get it in writing but at least pin them down to not just give you fluffy statements but to say yes this will happen.</string>

<string>The most difficult part of my training was physical training. PT, and exercise is not one of my fortes and I hated it, and I still hate it. So that's the most difficult part of all of my military training and upkeep. But the one good thing about the military's it does make sure you don't get out of line very much with your weight and your fitness. So even a day even though and no longer active in the military I get up every morning and walk a couple miles, kept my weight pretty much down, a little over, I probably should be two twenty I'm really about two thirty five. But you know that keep it down to, but that's that's difficult. Intellectually their training system is that, they trained you well they give you a lot of legs up to make sure you're doing alright. Training's good.</string>

<string>You have it luckier than I did. When I enlisted in the marine corps, the pay scales were sacrificial. These were in the days of the draft so there were plenty of people who were low ranking enlisted people that can be gotten you know by order of the president United States they just drafted them, so I think my first pay back in sixty seven was about sixty dollars a month, and if you took into account inflation, that would probably be about to two hundred and forty to four hundred dollars a month today. So it is pretty low, but it was was plenty, who was plenty you lived in the barracks. You drank beer for a quarter at the club and you didn't have it in a car virtually no one of the barracks had a car. These days the official pay is much better than that and I would urge you to go online and just type in military pay scales and the current pay scale come up in front of you and show you how much you get paid. So it's a little over an you first start out as an E1 but you get promoted up to E3 very fast, And E4 probably within a year or so. So then then you start getting a little better, and by the time you get in the senior ranks it pays comparable to civilian life in a lot of ways and the same with officers. A captain in the navy or a colonel in the airforce marine corps or army make the kind of money that the manager at that level would be getting an industry. And the entire package is pretty good because you not only get pay, but if you live off base they give you housing loans which is non taxed and so I the pay is not bad and when you go on base these days virtually everybody even the brand new enlisted people have a car or motorcycle or both, so pay's pretty good.</string>

<string>I believe the work culture marine corps and navy is different from civilian life in that it focuses on team effort more than anything else I would I would describe that work effort is much more like a team sport like baseball or football where there is a great deal of coordination a great deal of reliance on each other a great deal of doing what you need to be doing so you won't let the team down. I am kind of the webmaster and the communications guy for my high school alumni class, and when I put out a request "please let me know what color the eyes of your grandchildren" or anything like that, the people I hear back from the first are my military veterans, because one of the things you learn in the military is 'we're all in this together, everybody's got a job to do, and one of my jobs is to make sure that I don't make anybody else's job harder' so if somebody asked me clean up your bunk, clean up your bunk because otherwise they can do for you. If somebody asked me what color eyes do your grandchildren have, I will I respond right away so that they don't have to come running down and ask me again. And that's one thing you learn in the military and that's part of the work culture that I like the most, and I think it's more the most effective things in the military</string>

<string>Deployments, and getting called up as a reservist and seeing the active duty in a combat zone are all at of the behest of the national security apparatus. The commander in chief the president of the United states has the ability to order you wherever you are needed. And rather than something to be astued, or feared or worried about, I think deployment should be a thing of a goal people in your career want to be deployed so they can get activity and that will allow them to achieve wht they want to achieve. Even those who are reservist frequently want to get the job done and so they will look for a chance to deploy. Let me tell you a quick story. During the first Iraq war the commander of naval security group wanted to prove to his superiors that he really did not need reservists, so he issued orders that no reservist would be called up for the cryptologic community in the navy during the Iraq war. That was a huge disappointment to my people in Denver, huge disappointment. So I went down the hall to the intelligence community because they had been called up and some of the guys had gone to Iraq, and I said "look we've all got high level clearances, we're all college educated, most of us have advanced degrees, we're technically competent, we know what we're doing we probably could function as intelligence officers if you want us to" and he said "that's great because I got a draft coming home from Iraq right now and we don't have enough people to replace him and I hate to send some of these guys back for the second tour, but we'll take your entire boardroom, that is all your officers and most your chief petty officers if they want to go". One hundred percent of my officers said "I want to do that", the navy will not order me to do that I want to volunteer I want to go do that part of my job. So that's why I think you should look forward to deployment not regret one or trying to avoid one.</string>

<string>If you're asking me about activities on the ship and what happens on cruises, I have to tell you that I'm the wrong guy to ask. As a cryptologist, a hundred percent of my duty has been from land based cryptologic activities. I've been on about a dozen navy ships in my life but for less than a day in each case, generally visiting the cryptologic units on board to find out how their life is going. So from them what I've learned is life at sea is very busy. Sometimes working so much you have very little time left except for just eating and sleeping and getting your clothes washed and take care yourself than doing some PT. But largely on board a ship a lot of time spent reading, lot of time spent watching DVDs, of course the communications the way they are now, often you can call home, so that's the sort of thing you can do on a ship.</string>

<string>I'm rather a romantic in terms of the navy.  I love the history I love the traditions. I love the things we do, so it's hard for me to believe that everybody should want to be part of the navy. But you have to look in your own soul, the kind of person you are and what you're looking for in life. I enjoyed the team effort, I enjoy technology, I enjoy machinery. I am at peace when I'm on a large peace of equipment that that I can feel vibrating underneath my feet. There's a life to that kind of machinery that I don't get any place else. But it's hard for me to say about you, you have to again understand what it is you like what it is you like to do, and what it is you're seeking life</string>

<string>The gender mix in the navy is in transition, when I was in there or and the active duty and and to some degree in reserve duty there was a great preponderance of males. I remember we got our first female cryptologist and the navy reserve and than now cryptologic field has the good portion of them, and I would not even hazard a guess as to how many are in cryptology now, but you could probably get those numbers from your recruit, but I would I would think on the order of twenty five percent of cryptologists now are females. The other areas are similar more and more fields have become open to females, I knew one of the original fighter pilots who was female in the navy</string>

<string>My experience was the ethnic percentages in both the marine corps and the navy are quite comparable to civilian life and the civilian population. There may be a little plus up of some of the undere employed an underrepresented minorities, simply because the military is since nineteen fifteen the way been pretty well known for getting some of the best opportunities for minorities working their way up, like anybody. I mean you get a lot of free training you get your education covered when you're out, so it was good way for somebody with economic issues to get a leg up on life.</string>

<string>It'd be interesting find out what the number one reason we believe in the marine corps navy is. Within my experience, most people left the navy and the marine corps simply because they had goals. I wanted to pursue family life professional goals there were not supported by the active duty military. Now a lot of people like I did, enjoy the military and found it desirable not only to pursue my civilian pursuits, but to get in the reserve so I can still be part of the military and military life. It certainly has worked out well for me</string>

<string>One of the most critical features of military life is enforced separation from your loved ones, your family, and your friends. This is not too bad in this day and age, you need to remember that back in the early part of the eighteenth century, New England whalers would leave on equal shifts and be gone for two two and a half years was no communication all to their spouse or their parents, or the siblings or their friends. And then they would come back for a short period time and then got another ship and take off again. You don't see that kind of separation, but there will be some separation. For instance when you're in boot camp typically speaking you will not be allowed to communicate other than by letter to anybody outside of yor boot camp group, your platoon, or flight or batallion, or whatever that they call it in your service. So the advice I think you should give your your family is "I will be going I will appreciate any way you can communicate with me, I would still be part of your life, so keep me up on what's going on, and know that I'm thinking of you and I'll try to communicate with you whenever I get a chance."</string>

<string>There are a number of educational possibilities in the military and let's take these kind of from the ground up. The first is while you're on active duty you can apply for, if you're so inclined or qualified, the Naval Academy. You can apply to get support to get a degree in their number ways that they will support getting associates degree or a bachelor's degree. But if you already have a bachelor's degree, officers can apply to go to the naval postgraduate school and get an advanced degree there. There some officers allowed to go to school and college and and get a PhD for a few years. Those are all possibilities while you're in the service after you get out of the service you got the GI bill and those benefits change from time to time, so the best thing there is to double check with your recruiter, what they're currently offering you, how it works. My father went to law school on the GI bill I went to undergrad, finished up my undergraduate, and then went on to law on the GI bill. So that was mine, was different than his was and yours will be different than mine was so check with your recruiter how it is today.</string>

<string>I've had a number of careers both in civilian and military life, and they have kind of different advancement paths. The advancement path in the military is pretty regularized and it doesn't vary a whole lot by field. I mean cryptologists get advanced about the same with electronics technicians get advanced. It may be a little slower in the boatswain's mate group but not much. Advancement in the officer ranks again is pretty regularized, and typically it is: you get a promotion when you start out, you start out as a oh-one in the E1, and then after a certain number of months or years you're eligible for promotion and based on your the way of work you're either promoted not promote. And then each time you're getting a little more. So with an officer for instance starting as an O1, which is an insane hours attended up in four years you probably made it up to O3, which would be a captain in the army or a lieutenant in the navy, and you probably get that about the end of your first agreement to serve and a lot of people get out of the service at that time. And then you keep working your way up and typically speaking you make captain or colonel about year twenty five or so. And then you might have a chance of making admiral, but very few people make admiral. Enlisted people same thing they move up to the union, enlist in ranks pretty quick until you get up to about E6, E7, then it slows up a bit into you get all for the law. So that advancement paths that way. In academia you have two different advancement paths. One his tenure track is very difficult almost always requires a PhD, very hard to get a tenure track position and then frankly ten years denied to you and you gotta go to work for the government or something. In research like I do, independent research you get hired based on your skills and your advancement is based on your ability to perform ,and the ability to attract new funding for new work</string>

<string>the navy has a lot better chance of having transferable skills learned by you than for instance that one of the service militaria infantry type services I mean I was a M. sixty machine gunner in Vietnam as well as a linguist hard to find many jobs is him sixty machine gun so let's talk about those difficult position in the marine corps if you're in in sixty machine gun or what he kept telling to get out a return to civilian life they offered you something called project transition where you can go learned a marine corps field or civilian field if necessary that might be useful to you for instance just because I wanted to do for fun I put in for that project and I was assigned to the base photo lab where I was able to do photographing development and learn photographic skills which would've been very useful in civilian life and I wanted to pursue that as a profession so that's one way to look at it but my linguistic skills academia accepted my language training I got almost I think it was like twelve hours of credit in my from my language training from the military they just accepted but the major thing that I got was every place I've gone people said the man who is senior enlisted or an officer in the military has shown management discipline and and group choose patient characteristics which would be valuable to me and that has all transferred very well</string>

<string>it's difficult to generalize about life in the navy but let me tell you an incident that happened to me that I think is one of my memories of what I think the navy is like and what it should be like while I was working at Martin Marietta I got an opportunity to do an augmentation who are to Naples Italy for three weeks I was a lieutenant commander at that time like lieutenant commanders like a major in the army or the marine corps and I thought this sounds like fun I have no idea what I'll be doing well do it so I I got on a plane and flew to Rome and on my way to Rome I noticed a lot of other people short haircuts and they kind of carried themselves like navy people you off right athletic you don't fit and I said well it's interesting start talking to I'm sure enough they were reservists and they were going to Naples and I got to talk to him and there were some enlisted people a couple officers so it's fun and when we got to Naples we'll report and then it turned out there about Sergio and as luck would have it or bad luck I have in my mind I was the senior officer so I was in charge and there was a a fairly mature chief petty officer there who was a senior chief which is in a a purchase the next the highest rank you can get in the military E. nine in the in the navy is senior I a master chief but this guy was a senior chief so I had four officers the senior chief and everybody else was in most so what was I got I was in charge was I going to do so I knew we were supposed to help these people with their watch standing that is we go in and do our cryptologic duties twenty four hours a day and so we had so I turned to my senior chief I said senior chief you break the enlisted people into four what sections for you know you need three to cover every day and then you need to aim one to cover that because the weekend times too so for what section and I'll be for the officers so I got together with the officers and I said what we're in Italy for the one time in our life for over here to do some hard work but here's what I'm proposing I'm gonna tell the watch sections will set up a watch schedule so that people are working their butts off for a couple of days and then when they get their break they'll get a four or five D. break was known to you all so they can make it up to Venice you go up to Romer go down this is or just go around Naples for five days and enjoy their of Rome and there wasn't that that's a great idea so we got that all set up we got each each officer was in charge of one watch section and he would be in charge of up on the on the order of six or seven people some of whom were linguist but most were electronic warfare specialist or collection specialist or communicators and he would he would make sure they did their job on their watch section and he would help out with put officers did it during the watch which is help writing reports and keeping track what was going on and I was a senior guy so I did a lot of the a briefings to the senior people every briefed us navy of British navy captain and that was that was fun in the senior chief ally star right away right away writing fitness reports for the officers and enlisted evolves because at the end of the three weeks had to turn in what everybody done when they did a good job or not and I didn't want the local commander have to do that so we started doing it together so the senior chief and I did that the troops loved it everybody had a good time there but he did a good job and the active duty personnel who were there helping simply the best group that if we ever see and we never met each other before we got together we were in the navy common goal we know what we're doing we did a lot that's what the navy's all</string>

<string>when I was in the reserves what we call the ready reserve I here's what we did and I think it's very comparable to that every month we did the weekend drill that means you bet Saturday morning early and we work till about five o'clock Saturday evening Sunday morning early to about five o'clock for those two full days of work we got paid for day's pay and because that's what it if you look at the amount of leave people get on their active duty and a lot of time off they get blah blah they work about four hours a day every day of the year and so let's that's what they paid to get four days pay for two days and then once a year you got a two week actor Tracy someplace so does a really good actor trees I got Naples I got three tours in Japan and in London England once you know is just all kinds of fun stuff but then you went and you just went with equally active duty people and did their job learned what they were doing and just trying to figure out if I get called up how my gonna handle so that's what you did you did your work you did training and the good thing about cryptologists are if you got a radio and you got a linguist you can be a cryptologist anywhere now we did some actual cryptologic stuff right there in our home reserve unit the benefits you get pretty good pay you know I got to law school living off of the those four days pay that I got from the reserves bought food for me and my wife and my brand new baby daughter that was good and as you get senior right the pay is pretty decent then when you retire they add up how many days of reserve duty you got credit for doing your weekends how much you've got new year two weeks of active duty and then how much active duty you did like I get four years will bring cars they told all add up that gives you the percentage of your pay and then because I'm a retired commander I get retired commanders pay times this percentage so I get about in my case about assertive order it right retired get plus medical benefits plus some other benefits like I can fly space available around the world one military aircraft</string>

<string>there are a number of pets available for getting a commission as a commissioned officer noncommissioned officers and chief petty officers are petty officers in the navy noncommissioned officers and other services generally come to the military without any particular prior experience but to get a commission typically speaking here look at somebody who's at the collegiate level either already have a collegiate degree or they have that kind of an election experience beyond that is not particularly necessary you can get the commission and get a degree at the same time through the reserve officer training corps program at civilian universities that's very hard to get into a very competitive so you gotta be really smart and you got to be very physically fit twos while in those programs now that's like getting in the cattle once you're on active duty and once you've gone up to the race laws and listed person occasionally especially if you have a very very good test scores and have a really good record you might get an opportunity to become officers through a number of programs in my case I was commission after I had gotten my bachelors degree done my marine corps service got a bachelors degree was half way through law school and head of the wall and pretty positive your experience as a cryptologist and was given what they call the bureaucrat direct commission and the and the core so there is a case where spirits did allow me to get the direct commission and not have to go to OCS or to one of the academies</string>

<string>I think one of the things we miss most in life is good mentors and the ability to accept mentor ship from someone else one of the best mentors I ever had was head senior navy officer to me anyway see when I became an instant he was a Lieutenant Commander and the first active duty I did with him after I got my commission we went to Pensacola and we had to proceed every day three gate to get on base and the gate was manned not by military personnel but by civilian security guards that's wasn't the way it was when I was in the service but was there and they did a very bad job they were slovenly they didn't seem to be paying attention to what was going on sometimes she had to get their attention to even check your ID Sir here on base I just thought they were done a terrible job so we got ready to leave they passed out he formed a bunch of us who'd been on active duty there and on the foreman said tell us what your experience here and if there's anything you think should be changed clothes no and I said to the senior officer who is my mentor I really get a lot of have about that from Kate they did a bad job out here and they need to know what somebody needs to fix that and he said stop do not do that he said if there was a problem in the main gate you should fix it yourself or you should have told somebody when you first got here about it but my advice would have been know that C. operational issue somebody from outside helmet was broken would not help and it would just make it worse and he said that slot that they give you on that form they're gonna have to write a fitness report for you when you leave here about what you accomplish that form is their input into the fitness report to go right holy cow that's important as how you get promoted this could finish so I sat down to write my fitness report and I wrote I came here to learn the most marvelous stuff I came and learn things that will do me the very well in the rest of my career I keep things I can reply immediately to my fictional duties as an officer bom bom bom and when I got my room fitness supportive my home unit some month later so guess what those exact words were my fitness for ensign Davis came here and learned some wonderful stuff Benson Davis can use his stuff in his professional and I thought I'd that was good advice</string>

<string>I think the thing is the most important life is to establish something that your life stands for establish something of which you want to be proud and to devote yourself to doing that I think it is critical that you ponder those around you who can help you get to that goal and that you honor their goals and try to help them get to their goal as well</string>

<string>if you are a pretty consistent thread throughout all of the work I've done both in the navy in civilian life is trying to find a better use for high performance computing infers simulation especially as we run out of money in the government to get tasks done in them or the most expensive parts of any activity at government included on personnel expenses so if I can replace a person with a computer I'm in good shape right now the problem I'm trying to solve is we need more senior people who are able to do more mentor for younger people coming up through the ranks and we have a lot of very senior people are about to pass from the scene and we will lose all of their wisdom that they have gained over the years so we're trying to record their wisdoms we can pass on to future generations</string>

<string>there are number of levels that I run to in my professional life both in the military and academia about how do you get fired up in inspired you keep doing what you need to be doing I will avoid the seal logical analysis of being inspired by knowing where you fit in the world and go to something more immediate I have found both in both of my careers that my major inspiration comes from knowing the people who have gone before me the sacrifices they have made to get as far as they've gotten and I'm now got baton and I need to press ahead and when I run out of steam and start to flag I just think of everything they put in including many of them their lives read sacrificed to get where I am today and that puts me up again to keep going</string>

<string>in all the professional work I have done I have found that I'm most often really in touch with what I'm working on to the point where the rest of the world just disappears on and I mean what they call the state of flow I when I am doing one of two things the first is programming from the very first programming course I took in fortran all the way up to the programming I do day to day now which is more often working on websites and doing PHP Java script and HTML but when I am programming time stands still and the rest the world just disappears to some degree that's also true when I do technical writing like writing papers proposals are reports but most often it is when I'm doing programming which is several times a day I get a chance to do a little programming and I can feel the the world stop and wait for me to finish</string>

<string>in both of my professions both military and academic I have found that I've had to move my family from time to time and I think that has been occasionally injurious to them and a little more stability would have been better for my family life but all in all I think the the burden on them has been outweighed by the opportunities they had that they would have had because of some of the moves we made for instance my wife loves being near the ocean and had I stayed in the practice of law in Colorado springs she would have had precious little time at the ocean whereas in both the navy and in my condemn a career she's been right on the ocean</string>

<string>if you're interested in a stem career I think you'll find many of the branches of service are almost exclusively devoted to stem careers the navy and the airforce certainly are devoted that way and the army and the marine corps do have some infantry kinds of positions that take you away from your normal stem activities but even there the technology has caught up to the point where private in the infantry in both the marine corps and the army have to have a good grasp of science technology engineering and math just to use the technology that's provided to them so I think it's pretty wide open navy and the airforce have perhaps more simply devoted to stem but even the army has a lot of people cryptology for instance devoted stem tasks so virtually anywhere you want to go you'll find some stem opportunities</string>

<string>the thing I like about stem pursuits and to me that's why I really been my work in cryptology and in academia yes is the challenge the intellectual challenge the people I know who Love cryptology never could put out a crossword puzzle without frigging out and sudoku is the way they spend their spare time so if you like intellectual challenges this is a good way to go still will provide that for you and stem in virtually every area provides that kind of intellectual challenge and in system need to be a scholar you have to keep learning keep reading what I said was awesome promotion boards like that's when things I always ask candidates is what's the last book you have read what a book you're reading right now and what bush has made the biggest difference in your life</string>

<string>in pursuing high performance computing I've worked for about seven years with Lockheed Martin and then I've works of some twenty twenty five years since then and academia I would have to say I prefer academia because academia yeah is more focused on ideas and less focused on money I am greeted not by how much money I make or how much money and bring in for what kind of publications are publishing what can ideas I have what I can tribute and I enjoy that more than having to grind out everything in a way that makes money my experience in the private sector was some of the things we did they were illegal and probably where even though that's cool but they were certainly money grubbing and that didn't sit well with me are there others who are more entrepreneurial who like that kind of challenge how can I make money out of this and they would be more happy with private sector than I am</string>

<string>my favorite coding languages fortran for and I know you know you can get a copy of fortran for anymore but that's what I started out with and like an awful lot of people I you know what I really enjoy coding it's what I consider on the rights of Google fortran and joy during that these days though I probably spend more time reading PHP for websites and Java scripts for you know questionnaires to life than I do writing fortran but for trend is still my favorite language not a question how do you I feel like a field of programming your sciences I'm in computer science since nineteen seventy one in computer science has changed tremendously in that time when I took my first course in computers so I was structure on how to use for training for program one of Seymour craze for supercomputers the CDC sixty five hundred and that was wonderful and exciting work it turned out was really good at it sold my professor you talk to me one day about what I had in mind for profession and I told him I really would like to state in computers and he told me all day and this is remember nineteen seventy one you you won't be able to make any money in computers because soon there will only be two or three big computers in this nation state probably at big universities like one of cal tech and wanted in my tea and one at university of Illinois and everybody would use those computers and they're all feel very few compu to programmers doing all the program so I did not pursue it because I didn't think it was a growing field from what he told me and I think he was giving me good honest advice but it was certainly wrong because of course now everybody in his uncle has a computer not only on his desk but sometimes on his wrist watch and half the people playing with it do a little programming one kind or another so that's what's changed it's just huge compared to what we thought it would be in nineteen seventy one how much free time have you had in your career my career has provided me more for it was a wonderfully yeah just capital both of my crews who provided me more free time than I could use I'd you know you'd be surprised how much of the time when I get free time I spend it program and because that's what I love to do I spend it writing because that's what I love to do and in the military if you had a spare time at all not infrequent was spent working on another cryptologic problem we're trying to breaking new code or something of that nature so I have had more free time that I really wanted from from my career I've never felt constrained by that my wife unfortunate would tell you a very different story about my lack of free time spend with her how ethnically diverse as your Stanfield I think it's important that everyone have an ability and the opportunity to participate in any kind of work in one displayed and I am very unhappy when I hear about anybody who feels like they have been given a fair chance but it is my belief from what I've been able to observe that almost every place I've been there have been some representatives of virtually every ethnic group every gender every or you know sexual orientation preference available to people if they wanted to take it but I would be misleading you if I didn't say there seems to be some ethnic groups who seem to excel in this kind of work and who you see more often than other areas and it's frequently in computers it's amazing how many of the people I see at a conference if you just look around are of Asian or a sub continent Indian descent because those two ethnic groups seem to produce very good computer scientist but you see somebody from every conceivable group so you know that it's available to people who want to pursue it the more difficult the joints as our mind as far as access into stem fields I think places I've worked had been very open to everybody in fact have tried to aggressively go out and recruit people from different ethnic groups and make sure the gender Max the gender say the question and is it more difficult to join stand as a female or as a minority I can only speak from my own experience but my own experience has been that every place I've worked it's been very open to anyone based on their ability to do the job that seems to be the only criterion the people look for if there's been any kind of variance from that has been the aggressive attempts to recruit people from different ethnic groups in from different gender is to make sure the gender balance is correct but I have seen I have never seen any kind of attempt to keep one group from doing this trip no one would is it is a more difficult joins them as a female or as a minority speaking from my own experience the ability for a female or a member of the minority to join he stem career he is completely done then unhampered in the United States I have worked in the military at work for businesses and I've worked in academia and I have never seen anyone suggest that they were restricting hiring somebody because of their sex gender ethnicity for any reason other than are they capable of doing the work so I think it's pretty wide open and there is even an aggressive attempt to try to achieve a better balance of ethnicity and gender within stem careers in both academia and industry what what characterizes a good career one of the things that I frequently hear people say is that this career would make you more money than that career but it's been my experience that all of us are going to make enough money to satisfy our needs and even our caprices so the most important thing in a career is to do something with the issue too Hayden series of topless once so you get some sense of self fulfillment I team and I get a job that was necessary I did it well we achieved our goals the team that I worked with were all satisfied with what we did so I think the most critical thing in pursuing a career is finding a career it's going to give you that feeling at the end there will be enough money to to live on and there will be enough to have a good life if you pursue that career goal that will give you that self fulfillment what don't you like about staff or your I like it all I've been in doubt of stem careers since I graduated from high school one way or the other that's a literal truth and I've really enjoyed all of the work I've done stem and I enjoy it still to this day did thing that I would really like to see the different about stem is I wish but government sometimes who is a little more responsive to supporting the stem research it will make a difference so frequently the government takes the approach of we need to pass a law and keep somebody from doing it rather than that we need to fund some research than we can encourage people to do the right thing rather than trying to force them to do the right thing why should so sometimes you still got your that's a good description let me see if I get the guidance that went say it again why should someone choose to go into your system I have been and still both cryptology ended and computer science for a long</string>

<string>it seems sometimes that some careers get hyped up because of examples of someone who's tremendously successful so I would definitely not recommend anyone go into stem work if they are swayed by the stories of how much money Bill Gates made her some because that always fails to mention the Bill Gates was a very special person and made his money in a way that the vast majority of us would have a prayer of doing so I don't think you should ever go into a field thank you all that guy's a billionaire I want to be a billionaire like him I I think you should not look at the money or the success of the fame as a goal you want to achieve I'd go after something you can do and enjoy be proud of and let the fame and the money coming that</string>

<string>still is an interesting field you get to do a lot of good technical work but as you get more senior you'll find out that you spend more and more time trying to find a sponsor trying to find someone in the industry or the government or some place we'll pay you money to do the work you think needs to be done and that kind of development work although it is exciting in its own way and fun in its own way gets to be a drag after awhile and so that's a part of that that I think you need not to ignore know that it will be part of your job to do it especially as you get senior but know that it's not near as much fun this gone home and write code</string>

<string>so that's a part of that that I think you need not to ignore know that it will be part of your job you do it especially as you get senior but no that's not near as much fun this gone home and write code you know the more I look at these questions if I find more and more that I don't even I don't know useful and you should all vote that's real quick one of the long term impacts of entering your Stanfield or staff one lawyer in long term impact of being instant feel that you need to take cognizance of is technology does move ahead you've got to keep your self educated you got to keep yourself up to date talon taking some more education talent takes more courses and go to every conference get a chance go to see you can hear what's going on</string>

<string>I think that cryptology is a lot of fun because the people you meet in cryptology were frequently kind of the intellectuals I was on active duty down homestead Air Force base once when the word officer down there said the first thing you want to tell the nurses from the hospital when you see them in the officers club is here cryptologist because they're sick and tired of putting up with egotistical doctors and egotistical pilots but they love cryptologist because they know you're intellectuals he read a lot of books and that you have some appreciation of the fine arts so that's the sort of thing that kind of keeps you excited about not being in cryptology</string>

<string>one of times when you're working in stem you're giving a specific task to do yet you might be given of subroutine of code to write and you have to do that but the thing that is important in any kind of stem activity you have to be alert for opportunities you have to be open to changes in the do you see something that's abnormal if you discover something that's not available to everybody else and one example I know of is when I was reading high performance computing at Caltech a bunch of guys quit the high performance computing center and started a new company that was going to write pro code for big parallel computers and to do that writing of the code they had to develop a new performance tool so they developed a little piece of software that measured the performance of high performance computers and they sold millions of dollars worth of that little performance to and they never did get to do any programming they want to do because they were so busy selling all that code so they had to be alert for the fact that they're doing programming for high performance computers wasn't and remitted feel the writing little tool for terrific so got to keep your mind open</string>

<string>in my professional life I've had two mentors that really had a great deal of influence on me in the navy shortly after I got commissioned I was working for a gentleman who was our executive officer Lieutenant Commander George lam and he and I went on active duty for training to gather and we were down in Pensacola Florida and we had to go through the main gate for the training center every morning and strange enough that's a gate on which I used to stand guard duty when I was in the listed person but they had civilians there now and the civilians were sloppy and not very attentive and certainly didn't show any snap or involvement of what they re doing so when we got time to leave that particular post they gave us a form to fill out in the form said tell something you've observed here and what you got out of that and what we need to do to make it better and I told the commander lamb I think I should write up the main gate and he turned to me and said then whatever you do do not light up the guys on the main gate because he said if there was a problem you're an officer you should have taken care of it right there if there is a problem you want to have taken care of you should take care of it are there somebody else to clean it up for you that's one thing he said the second thing is be aware that they give you a forum like this and say what happened when you were here beware that that's how they're going to write your fitness report when you go home so I thought all that's good so I wrote a fitness report that said tell you what when I came here I learned all kinds of wonderful stuff and I'm Robert officer for everything I've done and this will stick in my mind for a long time because this is such great training and when my fitness report came back it said instantaneous came in he learned some wonderful stuff and it was great training and had a great influence on his life almost word for word cut and paste off that for so that's the kind of advice he gave me I've had a similar mentor in my technical live Paul the Sina who is now at Argonne national labs also somebody you needed to listen to so that's too good piece of advice from two good guys that I worked for and I hope you get a mentor that give you good advice to</string>

<string>I frequently see that the best year of my life with my year in Vietnam that's true to a large degree because of the tasks that we had over there in my ability to contribute to that task and being able to see or have reported to us the results of our activities there but the thing that impressed me the most over there as having a it made a difference in my life was my finding out that I was not frightened when under fire there are a lot of people over there who who really lost it when the first round started coming in be they rockets or mortars and yet I found that didn't bother me very much and I've spent my life without a great deal of bravery being exhibited and this seems like there's almost everything I do scare some people on the other I've got acrophobia every other kind of full you can think of but I didn't get rattled when the rounds came and and that gave me an assurance go about my life the rest of my life knowing well that's one thing that did morale</string>

<string>the call of the military on your time is different in civilian life there are times for instance if you're in a combat zone where the call is all the time if you're in active combat you're on duty twenty four hours a day trying to keep yourself alive and achieve your mission and there are times when you're not in a combat situation where there's a tremendous amount of spare time and mostly that's granted to you to take time to do things interventions to you even in combat situations for instance while I was in Vietnam I was given to one week periods where they flew me anywhere in the Pacific Rim that I want to go to visit so I spent a week in Australia all on my own doing anything I want to do and we can Japan later on the same way but in general the military we give you weekends off in general they give you thirty days leave here where you can go where you want do whatever you want and they do what they call basket leave that is leave they just give you it's not charge against your leave they just tell you don't come to work for a couple of days so it kind of evens out so there is a lot of spare time from time to time but those who do ship or duty same deal once you're at sea you might spend twelve hours a day on your job and have very little time other than to sleep and keep yourself clean but when you're sure you might have a lot of spare time</string>

<string>what other things that nature has given us is a wonderful system of balancing its inner inner ear and some people are more sensitive that than others and if they get into a vehicle that's moving rolling it makes them sick and everyone gets sick to some degree but there are extremes on both sides I fortunately was blessed with windows cast iron stomachs never get seasick we were in Pensacola once on active duty and we read today fifty foot boat and went up red snapper fishing and I had been in the marine corps but everybody else board was of real salt water sailor they don't everybody got sick on that boat except maybe to make me sick bet but on the other hand lord admiral Nelson who won the battle of Trafalgar the greatest naval hero of all time was famous for being so seasick when he first went to see every time he went to see that he would have to go to this cabin for days before he could get a stomach settled down again so it's one of the things you just kinda have to put up with but if you're the average person you'll have a little of that if you're on one extreme or the other you'll have to learn to live with whatever the good lord gave you and it's not the end of the world it'll work out</string>

<string>my field almost and I am even bigger anomaly that most people in my field this star on my shoulder boards means that I'm a line officer that means I can command the ship at sea but I'm a cryptologist in my entire career I have never been to see on a naval ship the only times I've been there see is three cruises on civilian cruise liners with my family the average cryptologist will probably spend probably about ten percent of his career on a ship and of that ten percent only five percent total will be spent at sea so cryptologist don't spend a lot of time at sea my little brother on the other hand was sees some marine officer and that basically meant he spent six months out of every year city because he was on the blue crew and the blue crew was out six months and then the whole crew was out so depends on the kind of specially get into in which workers are how much time you spend</string>

<string>it seems like in America today studies have shown that the vast majority of us suffer from some degree of self doubt and sometimes this is manifest in a way that people can tell that the person is lacking in self confidence or have self doubt sometimes it's masked by exaggerating your sense of eagle insufficient since sufficiency in trying to override the self doubt you're feeling inside but in any case when you start to feel self doubt I think the best thing you can do is always refer back it's what I do anyways refer back two people with whom you're working knowing that you're part of a team you have an obligation to support them and carry your own load but they have an obligation to support you as well so when you feeling self doubt just think about grief at the team and how many people are there to to back you up in call for on them for help if you need it</string>

<string>in most endeavors the definition of success is an important one unfortunately poor management frequently results in people beginning an endeavor without knowing what the definition of success is and that leaves each person on their own to try to define what success is and for them that may be a little easier most of us have enough to your goods most of us have enough food to eat most of us have enough shelter and unless you're in a combat situation most of us have purity and safety but most of us do not have a sense of having achieved something that is self fulfilling so we usually in my mind success unless it's imposed by a standard from above success is really doing something that helps you feel like you're contributing and you're you're using willing gifts that were given to us best</string>

<string>if there's some options that are open to you about studying I think there are number factors you should look at if you're straight out of high school I think the first factor is you need to do a very realistic evaluation and have some other people help you evaluating from the other side outside of yourself about how mature you are and how ready you are for what kind of university or college setting a lot of people I know and I was probably one of them with them did much better advised to have Pagel read to my folks and stayed home for my first two years of college and gone to a local junior college in California at least the junior colleges are set up to be feeders in the state college system so they have very rigorous courses basic introductory courses you can take very cheap very convenient a lot better than going off and I just I think I need some guidance I tried going to college on my own for the first two years there really was a disaster set me back home ways and had to make up for it later that I should have had the other thing you do you think about is what are you a big institution person or small it's you did you really enjoy being with big crowds are you like a small setting and then look for a college that offers whatever fits you best</string>

<string>when you think you are picking a college sometimes you look ahead at your career and think what difference will it make and sometimes it makes very little difference very little difference at all for instance at the bachelor's level generally virtually any college in the country we'll give you a decent education allow you to go on to your career on post graduate work but there are some colleges that have a better name than others if you want to go into graduate work for instance you might be much better advised to go to Stanford if you can get into Stanford then you would be the going to cal state LA it's not that you would be a whole lot better educated at Stanford although that's probably too but it's just that when you get ready to go the people looking at you will consider that school and the same is true with even your postgraduate work I went to the university of Colorado for law school and I was worried about my class rank going through law school and yet the lawyer who was in private practice told me he had practiced law for fifty years and never will what's never once had any client ever asking where he went to law school and was class rank words now it's not always true and that lawyer not mortgage do private practice but wanted to become a Supreme Court justice or a professor at Harvard Law School then the school to which he went would be very critical and his gray drakes with very critical so sometimes it makes a big difference times it doesn't make much difference at all by and large most people will never know where you did your work in school and they won't know whether you did well or poorly intrinsic GPA</string>

<string>this country is wonderful there was a recent study that found that virtually anyone with you intellectual capacity to go to college could go to college and they can do it very inexpensively if they want there are a number of options somewhat which entail running up huge student debt but some do not so there are number of things you could do for instance there are a lot of skull ships available for varying kinds of people there's the ROTC programs that allow you to go to college you know basically pay for it and you know you know we get a good college education you get a good kick started a military career that you can do for six years what if your obligation is and then go to civilian life or stay with the military into the entire crew of the military lot of flag officers these days in the navy or in ROTC grads Bobby Inman this hole in one was famous for so that's a good way to go to college even if you in quotes cannot afford so good luck you're the way you do it get hurt us</string>

<string>when considering a career field I think it's important that you consider the various aspects of that field because in almost every major stem the field there are thousands of different positions you can take you know we ended those or even broken down further so the broader your education is in those fields the more you'll get a sense of we'll hear a number of opportunities I might do this rather than that I might become but visualizing the expert in data analysis rather than a programmer in transaction processing for credit card come so you want to get a feel for both of those while you're in school so I think that it's not a specific course I'd recommend is justice approach of sample everything as you go along and it and give it a shot is always going and destroy your GP eight because you just incapable of doing the work give it a shot in the NC with them it rings a bell with you or at least put that your data banks because it might not interest you now but ten years you know you'll be a different person you might want to reconsider</string>

<string>virtually every stem field you want to continue to develop your skills in two principal ways the first is formal education you know if if you're not working on your next agree your love if you've got a terminal degree like a peach tea then your spirit your MBA or masters in counseling just keep going with education I regret every hour I did not spend in the classroom that I could how many hours did I spend watching stupid TV you're watching a baseball or football game that I can remember now instead of doing something or have been more productive so that's one second wave is technical professionalism demands that you continue to read your journals from your technical associations and that you attend conferences and go here the papers present so that takes up a lot of time but that's the way you've got to keep it up if you're gonna do stem work</string>

<string>many people have a different take on how college differs from high school but by and large the thing I've served both in my own experience and the experience of my daughters is they went through that transition is high school generally allows you get by just by learning things and giving them back to the instructor kind of rote recitation of what you've already been taught writes colleges much more likely to get somebody's saying to you stop you have to think about this by yourself and you have to give me some original fought about how it all fits together and how it can be used so high school he is challenging to some degree but colleges where you really need to start thinking through programs and policies</string>

<string>the study preview regular amount when I was in college but some people had to study a lot more than I studied in some people study a lot less than I study it depends on the courses you're taking it depends on intellectual capabilities you have in the background you have but it's probably twice as much studying in colleges who used to doing the most high schools but that varies by high school what I know their high schools we can get to the entire high school program and get pretty good grades by doing nothing other than showing up in class and then there are other high schools are very very challenging their almost collegiate like yeah and the amount of study you have to do to get a decent grade</string>

<string>I think if you do pursue stammers and educational goal and a career you need to always be open to the other things in life recreation physical fitness and I don't mean work it out I mean just walking or taking up golf or something get you up and moving around is important it's also important I have a philosophical outlook to enjoy the fine arts to learn how to interface with people to give some consideration to spiritual affairs I'm not advocating religion but I think you need to think where did I come from why am I here no wonder my obligations to anything or anybody and where am I going down here so give yourself some time to consider those things don't trivialize them because they're not stem but enjoy them as best you can</string>

<string>fortunately all of us grew up in the country that provides pretty much free education up to the high school level and after high school education can be incredibly expensive but there are a lot of different ways to pay for it and their ways to get education on the cheek as they say in California where I live now you can get a very good start at a four year degree and junior colleges I community college city colleges they're all go by different names but a two year schools and the education there is just as good as it is at the big schools live three daughters and all of them the one time or another took courses at junior colleges generally during summer sessions and they'll with two very good schools you seal a university of Chicago Emory David UC Davis and the university of southern California all good schools and yet they said the education they got in their summers at a community colleges which justice challenging and justice will present itself but there wide even ways for you to pay for an education you just gotta go scattered out go don't just take what people say you can do you know keep looking and talk to more people and make sure you double check everything</string>

<string>when I went to college we were lucky you didn't have to really take out loans that was in a common way of going to college you can get five by a part time job and money you saved up over the summers now it's gotten so expensive in some schools teach you you might be in a position where you have to take a loan she semi rare you very careful about that and you know the state schools are still the best deal dollar for dollar and virtually everything you can do it in a private school or a proprietary school you can get a state school where the taxpayers are paying some of the load for you so consider those very carefully before you take out loans there while giveaways to finance you educate careful with the loans</string>

<string>one of the really good things about a stem career in stem careers are to some degree fungible that is you pick up skills in one that can be easily used and other factors a famous firm in Massachusetts solved all of us unsolvable problems by assigning biologists to physics problems and physicist a biological problem so it's it's not like what you learn a skill while you're stuck in that field but you do have to learn some basic skills to get going so I think I think that the critical thing is to get a good feel for things and not worry about what I have this skill I have to add that skill to swallow food here the college will put some requirements on you if you're going to do work in computer science are going to demand that you have a certain amount of mathematics</string>

<string>if you go to college you're going to find some teachers no really click with you we gonna find some teachers who are the boring side in every field you'll find some teach who have their own personal issues are working through that don't make him a good fit to to if you're a large state school like I went to you can almost always find a different professor in that area and usually there are institutions organizations that publish this guy's good teacher was Mister so you can change if you have a really bad teacher but mostly you'll find the teachers your carpet and they have something to teach you and something you can learn from them so I think that's true we coasted difficulty I think again you have to learn to be within years I've never been a runner Ike would never be able to run a marathon I hate running where that had to do it in the service it has been painful to me I've been able to do it but I just don't like it so for me to go into physical education and try to teach people how to be long distance runners would be a bad choice I think all of us need to look at our own capabilities physical mental organizational and say if it's really difficult for me then maybe I should I'm in the wrong field if I have to be able to do this to be in this field why would I think I'd be happier once again those who so maybe a different feel choice to be the right thing to do I don't mean you need to Dodge every challenge it comes to your life but you have to be honest with yourself some and pick a different way</string>

<string>educators always tell you what I was hearing you repeat that your grade is not the important thing learning what they're trying to teach you is important learning how old put their teaching you will fit into your life is court mastering the material is important learning yourself whether Michael that how do I need to behave to be able to do the right thing all those things are important the GPA will follow on its own but there are number of factors that will be decided by your GPA one for instance is if you want to go on to graduate work it's going to be impacted by Eugene another is if you're trying to get a job there are lot of people who before they will hire you or look at your grades and test and see whether you did well in school so all of us have some affect but I think you know of being obsessed with GPA is not productive focus on what you need to know what you need to learn and what you need to find out about yourself during the process</string>

<string>it's certainly not always true about people in the military but the work I did the military was very transferable to the civilian sector even though my ultimate specially was Hanoi dialect Vietnamese linguist it wasn't crypto linguistics which means I probably could have gone to an essay and got the job as a civilian anytime I wanted plus a **** like clearances I'd picked up in the military very transferable when it got me the number of jobs in fact got me two jobs at least because I had those five global clearances already my basic skills and team Morse code operator probably wouldn't have much transfer ability but my general skills in electronic certainly would have been sellable so I think my skills were very transferable plus the fact in the marine corps fewer of them sixty machine gun or rifle and before they let you out of the car they gave you about the three month period where they would train you in the civilian school called project transition yeah I made use of that probably shouldn't have but I did anyway because it was fun by working in the base photo lab for several months before I got discharged learning all about photography so one way or the other you come out of the military with very transferable skills</string>

<string>the good news is navy and military pay in general these days is pretty competitive you will not do poorly in the navy or Air Force the marine corps the army Coast Guard as long as you do your job when you rise through the ranks you get promoted when you spend time you know the pay scales go up and up and up and you're going to be able to do all right there are some duties that give you a little extra pay being a paratrooper being submarines being a pilot but that extra pay is pretty trivial so you shouldn't be thinking in terms of I want to do this in the navy because that way I can make some extra money find the best career field fits you best and do that money</string>

<string>to me the thing that made the very core the navy different from civilian life was the team orientation and I think that showed up in a number of different ways and one of the ways it showed up social I was the executive officer of a reserve unit in Topeka Kansas when I lived in Colorado springs and the commanding officer lived in Denver so when we had weekend duty we would fly from Denver and Colorado springs down to Topeka to do our weekend duty that we follow her own nickel and we had to pay our own way down and we did that for several years and most of the rest the unit came from all over Kansas most of them did not live there in Topeka so we don't get in there about Frady about dinnertime and we all immediately start calling each other because they put us up in the hope navy put us up in a hotel there for the weekend if we are coming from base they paid for that we call each other and find out who was there and we all get together we go to dinner there we go out to one of the clubs and we drink beer and listen to music all night as almost the entire unit even the guys who lived in Topeka would come join us and do that and then we come and we work hard all day Saturday then we do that again Saturday night we all get together go to dinner together go to clubs together so to me that indicates kind of the navy culture we were a team we ate together when we knew each other we know each other by name we knew each other's problems we knew how to help each other get through</string>

<string>due to the dangers involved in the importance of the mission that the navy a marine corps in the rest of military all very rule orient and sometimes you have to look at the rule and save even if it's a stupid rule no it's not a bad rule even though it's not the best rule so I'm gonna following just pick so breaking the rules he's never okay on the other hand they're a lot of times when you need to get something done and you have to break rules to do there been times when I in the navy what install equipment from somebody else in the navy because my unit needed it and I wanted it and they were using it silent got it that was breaking the rules had been caught I probably would have never made command but I didn't get caught so make command so sometimes that's true sometimes breaking the rules is came for unit cohesiveness if you discharge from the military everybody who had broken the rules about when they were supposed to drink alcohol your pal would be nobody left was that okay no I understand the rules station doing yeah no I got very upset by and large as I've said so many times I think you have to remember and the hole where you're supposed to be when you're supposed to be there that's one rule you never want to break where you're supposed to be when you're supposed to be</string>

<string>there was one time in the marine corps when I was made in charge of one of the classes Cole I was the same rank of everybody else in the class all I'd be a bit of E. three which is a PSC in the marine corps and some of them were still privates you but I was basically the same way but I was tall and so they may be charge and so one of the things I was supposed to do in charges after we had finished our session late in the afternoon I was to March the people it shall we get showered then everybody would go back more come back to the classroom to finish your evening classes alone who marched over together and it was important that you March over in the formation a state information and when you got there then you broke formation in that everybody would run to try to get the child life one day we came back in the ring two or three other classes were being marched out along with mine and they broke out of formation before they were dismissed and ran to the challenge and my guys start to break out of my formation and I turned around in a blind rage that still amazes me to this day and I screamed at them get back after Lancs and they did it's amazing ability to and then I just miss them when they random word to back in line because these other guys who broke well somebody reported that incident to the breaking and running in the Chow line to the her people in charge the marines were in charge at the classes and they punished every unit for doing that and I went to them and said my gosh not break ranks they did not lead breaks until I dismissed and you can ask everybody in the whole tell you we do break ranks and the people in charge said well the report we got was everybody broke ranks and they did note that you didn't break ranks in your group so we're punishing everybody gather and I said well I'm going to resign my leadership that because that's not right and a yawn let my troops death and like the the senior sergeant called me aside and said don't do that don't do that your troops soon though you you did your best and they will stick with you and yet there's no way I can overturn the senior people who boarded that we punish all so that's a time when I I really sought to bring or did the wrong thing they should have done a better investigation and said everybody's unit except Davis gets punished his didn't break ranks may get from the challenge</string>

<string>my career in the military it's been blessed with having good working conditions almost every place I've been now sometimes that was relative for instance most the places I've been I've worked in office like said he was surrounded by technical gear and then controlled by air conditioners because the technical gear doesn't do well if it's a hundred degrees and a hundred percent humidity humans do alright you know they're not cultural but they don't die but you get that kind of conditions with electronic gear and it does stop so I've had a pretty good and mostly it's been excellent and I have a mind but even in bad conditions I generally got better conditions than other people for instance when I was a content right smack dab on the DMZ and Vietnam we are about two thousand meters from the DMC we had terrible conditions I mean we're going to concerts tack we were living in bunkers but my bunkers were better than most about Chris work and some of the grunts were sleeping outside in trenches so even in bad conditions I have good conditions for work and the life in fact we had the only air conditioned bunker in Vietnam and we had a generator the only generator on the yeah yeah caught yeah Vietnam content we had the only generator it Cantiere that ran all night because we needed to keep our radios up and to keep our air conditioning unfortunately we we never mentioned the grunts but the air conditioning barely kept the place tolerable within it was still pretty high that bunker but that those are good conditions but the rest of time top notch office like environment very good</string>

<string>I had so many good experiences in the navy there are so many things we did were fine and exciting and and when I look back on them I I just can't imagine that I got to participate in that I got to fire weapons I've never have a chance to fire before I fired several thousand rounds through an M. sixty machine gun at how many people get to say they got to do that I was blessed in a lot of ways but never have you fired a human being so I don't have the kind of moral issues a lot of guys but back with them shot and killed people I did that was fun it was fun when we were down at homestead Air Force base when we designed and ran our very own he survey of how the people on that base we're being treated by their organization to how the navy was doing by the cryptologist that was fun at was fun thing to do and got us a good reputation actually when we got ready to leave the base we were accused of not being reservist being some kind of sneaky people from the management group were just pretending to be your service so they could come to the service so so that that was fun I've been on all kinds of ships I've been all kinds of aircraft I've been in helicopter rides it would take me a lifetime because the fun I've had</string>

<string>every career has pressures on that could impact the families especially the spouses and the crew members are there some special career pressures on members the military because it is a little more dangerous than some other occupations it is not nearly as dangerous as the public make it out to be but you know it's still a little more dangerous actually if you're a crab fishermen your chances of dire probably greater than they are working in the marine corps states but there are pressures on the spouses others no specific advice you can give somebody like that the navy does a very good job of putting care of the spouses the navy's tuned to the pressures that are on them try to make it as easy as it can on them and that's up to the they remember to make sure their spouses are aware of those opportunities for support and assistance</string>

<string>active duty is an interesting term that means when you're serving full time in the military typically speak he when you talk about somebody being on active duty you mean when they were on for an extended enlistment of some kind in the regular services and for me that was four years running from April of nineteen seven to April of nineteen seventy one those four years I was on active duty in the United States Marine Corps and that was split up was about a year doing boot camp when my preliminary training as a Morse code operator then a year doing language training in Washington DC than a year in Vietnam and then about three months in Thailand and the old remaining nine months were devoted to training and mustering out in the United States in North Carolina so those four years but after that I got in the reserves and every year in the reserves you do two to four weeks of active duty most of us anyway every year so by the time I got reserves I done another sixteen weeks of active duty for training they call that do tray all around the world Naples Italy to masala Japan but most of it in the United States San Diego Pensacola Washington DC places of that nature so all told I get about four years of active duty in the marine corps and then about a year and a quarter active duty in the navy in addition to the weekend Le grills it you did one week in them</string>

<string>well it's kind of a difficult question to answer in a precision because that changes from time to time for instance during World War two they were very young people who list and they look very old people and watched because he needed people very badly but right now basically the time limits are on the order of you must be at least seventeen years old and then you still need parental permission until you're eighteen to enlist in the navy and then you can list up until about the age thirty and this varies from time to time and the services change it from time to time depending on the requirements and the services are different for instance the navy right now is thirty two years the marines are twenty nine years but the statutes say you can be in listed up to age for forty two if they need so that changes and their exemptions made but that's because of the rain seventeen Tim thirty it's kind of when they want you to enlist</string>

<string>all throughout history nations have had to defend themselves against people who wanted their land or their crops or their valuables or sometimes just wanted destroyed what they head for the sheer joy of destroying something somebody else hacer seems to be something in human nature that says if that guy's got something and I can't take it least I can break it up and he can't so there's been a need to defend oneself and generally you do you go to the population and say you've gotta come fight with us the Greek states had such a system the the Romans had small through life and in the nineteenth and twentieth century nation states would say you must serve when the time comes and one of the things they found useful as it's useful to train people before the time you think in the militia and see and the Continental Army or the militias even they end the civil war that mit local people would get together and trained militarily so that there was a need for there to be called up the reserves serve that function today the navy may only have the money for and need five hundred thousand people river the number is this this year enough but they may need twice that many of war breaks out so a lot of people they say well you can go home and be a civilian but will pay you a little to come in and drill on weekends to keep your skills up to date keep your promotions in line learn new skills and things of that nature and then if if there is a need for you to come on active duty will call you and those of the reserves and many reservists volunteer to go back on active duty from time to time for special duty had a friend who really love cryptology and ever so often E. bill it would open up at the national purity agency in for me and if he found out about it he put in port he'd say will recall been active duty for two years now do that job if he if he wound up doing almost an entire career just those two year kinds of duties but that's what the reserve support to go when they're needed</string>

<string>questions about people who died in the military or questions about people who you may have killed in the military are always very sensitive issues to raise to someone until you get to know them pretty well but let me just say about what I just fax so you'll know I was in a unit in Vietnam that was comprised of about a hundred people we had two people who are on the wall in the Vietnam memorial in Washington DC master sergeant storm and chief gates died in the Vietnam I knew them well enough to visit with him and talk to them I didn't know much about their families or their history or anything but enough to nod in talk baseball with the more professional matters they did not die my presence they died away from me but those are two I didn't know who died in military on the other hand home I had more than four of my friends and I see more than because you're a couple people I knew in the marine corps who died I couldn't really consider for this but let's say for my friends who died in the marine corps from noncombat reasons and in three of those cases blues automobile accidents in the last case it was an accidental drowning is nears the neighborhood establish didn't anything to do with there being in the service</string>

<string>but this will be listed in the navy I had already done four years active duty in the marine corps rising to the level of staff sergeant in the marine corps it was a staff sergeant the marine corps reserves for two years in a non pay status which meant I was intending drills but I wasn't getting paid for it and I didn't do my two week active duty and then during that time I was also working as a cryptologist and they just never pay bellacor cryptologist doing do you like that as soon as that time was up I listed in the navy and my position was cryptologic technician CT interpretive I branch and then I was a first class petty officer which is exactly the same pay grade E. six as staff sergeant is in the marine corps so that was my first position in the navy you would call that was my rate CT I want</string>

<string>unfortunately when you talk about stem activities in the military mine were very highly classified and I have not been informed that either work I did has been unclassified I had the wonderful work story that you would really enjoy about something we did in Vietnam but it was highly classified and I think remains classified to this day so I can't tell you that story so we go to my civilian life and see high performance computing research I was at the Caltech center for advanced computing research CCR when we were doing advanced computing research in high performance computing and I was there when we acquired the Intel paragon drool please see until delta so I was part of the team that both work on the Intel delta which is one of the first massive parallel computers and was there when we put the paragon so I guess I'm very very proud of that work in the field of stem there's you know Caltech is at the very top people who find out that you either went to school they are taught there or work here as a researcher that's that's gonna be the top your career right there</string>

<string>well the progression of the stem careers through the decades is pretty hard to stomach when you're just starting out to some degree of maybe a little daunting but let's let's I give you what I've experienced over the years when you start out in stem you're gonna probably start out relying a lot of the skills you learned in high school junior college bachelor level college master's degree or PhD where do you come into the process and a lot of those skills you use every day you know like a programming skill if you're doing programming or mathematical analysis of some kind and you do that a lot but you probably spend maybe a quarter of your day writings English one kind or another but very soon you're going to find maybe just after a few years you're spending half your day writing English and only and the other half doing code and by the time you get to be more and more senior you gonna spend more and more time writing so there is a secret there if you can advance in the stem fields you better get good at writing good concise believable compelling English people can read and they'll go along with what you're trying to get him to go along with good materials you're giving so that's how it progresses you start out doing the technical work than you do more and more reporting and management until the very end and then some of the guys I know spent eighty percent of their time writing English one way or the other are preparing lectures or something of that nature</string>

<string>stem science technology engineering and mathematics that's a pretty broad range of capabilities there and so they're a broad range of careers that you can follow some of them would involve clearly different kinds of lifestyle for instance if you're a civil engineer part of the engineering field you might spend most of your career outside with blueprints and you don't doing surveying and in building buildings that would be completely different the stem career in Peter programming where you're gonna spend your entire life in the lab doing program chemistry will lead you to a different career set I work to the other laboratories nor Chicago Illinois when we were doing drug manufacturing and learning how to do that so that completely different situations for all those career field it is as wide a range as you can almost conceive and it's hard to believe any person could not find some stem career that fit their own capabilities their own interest and their own proclivities</string>

<string>I think of my life is being built up basically of two different kinds of stem careers the first was my stem career in cryptology stem careers in cryptology are broken into subsections in the first one I'd like to talk about is kind of the electronic warfare section these the papal then analyze well emissions from varying kinds of electronic year somewhere intended emissions like raiders like some are not like keyboards you met and they study the characteristics of those waveforms and try to get intelligence out of them you also have people who are collection specialist in that feel they have to know communication techniques and capabilities in the physics behind them for instance and they do the collection then you have the analyst in these frequently or people who specialize in both encryption encoding of information and they're very heavily laden with people who are excellent in mass so you get people doing that then you get a group the linguist in the linguist are probably the furthest from the stem fields at per se in that little more you work they do is more in the other kind of liberal arts section of things but even they have to have a good grasp of mathematics because the they assist both the collection people and the analytic people doing their jobs they're doing so there are a range of fields and tell in computer science let's it's limited to computer science research there's a lot of feel range there to largely in who can work for computer science research can be done in universities it can be a little softer or unit can be hardware oriented you can do the same kinds of things for industries you can be a programmer or you can be a developer of hard work my younger brother for instance went to work for IBM are developing hardware for laptop computers and then with IBM soldier laptop business to Lenovo in China he worked over there and flew to China and Japan all the time developing here's he he got a PhD in computer science so that was what he did with his degree a so wide range of things in computer science research alone as well as thinkable service and the salesman structural duties that you could have in those fields</string>

<string>if you're making a crude choice remember this there is no best career for everyone there is a tendency in our society to think a career where you can make the most money is the best career or their career we'll have the more status the best career and we all know jokes about mothers breaking on their son the doctor you know so a physician is a very good honorable career it's a lot of people who are not cut out to be position so the most miserable people I know are people who positions or lawyers accountants found even though they could do it even though they were good at the hated and it just did not make them for Phil to do it one of my professors in law school was a physician first and he said being a physician was not challenging you know you've got the green nose in a purple tongue you get pill number fifty five next and so he wanted to do something where you can expand on what you not just follow the rules so the best careers the best career for you and that means you have to have self knowledge self analysis indeed factual understanding of what the varying careers actually do not the way the prettier dawn TV or in the movies but they really do every day and find out the one that fits your capabilities the best don't get second into the trap of I can do that so I should do that Lana ms will people I know can do calculus but don't like doing engineer they got into it because they could do it that's not where they're heartless</string>

<string>well they seem pretty straight forward retail how this works at the institute for creative technology what we found out is you can do a whole bunch of short video clips of someone discussing a particular topic and then cut those up and save them and then ask people who are users to pose a question and then there's something called natural language processing which is seen elaborate and well thought through well practiced and well tested capability of trying to match up the questions and the factors in the questions with one of the responses and so the snail natural language processing algorithms will try to find the best response they can that matches your question and then trying to do that with enough regularity itself like a real conversation and to some degree it does because of course in a real conversation you might ask me what's the predominant gas in Martian atmosphere I wouldn't know so a lot of times you have a conversation with somebody you ask him some I don't know ask me so well you know but that's the way it basically works</string>

<string>all the stem fields in general are good fields into which you should sooner going they are all honorable professions they're all very well paid they're all fairly stable in employment and they're all almost all of them then involved very good working condition so all the stem fields are good ones to go into picking the best one has to be an individual choice most of them have a pretty good future in terms of people need they're gonna we need more and more people in stem because stem does require some ability in math and science than a lot of people don't have and can't choir but within those fields you have to decide theoretical physicist made love what he's doing but a person who's a natural born I'm Peter programmer might not like at work at all and vice versa</string>

<string>you might want to know who's makes the most money and stem which it feels going to pay me the best I would encourage you not to think that way because is a matter of fact virtually everyone in this country anyway has enough money to buy food we have enough money for shelter and clothing in transportation and healthcare it's hard to find somebody who's so impoverished they can't afford these things so the money money you make is not this crude issues you might think there's very good research showing that after a just a subsistence level happiness does not grow up with income and some of the most miserable people are the people who've made the most so money is not a very good way to pick a career but within the still feel they're all very new high paying jobs that's like saying who's the richest person America as compared with the second richest person in America will fully both got so much money I can't spend you know they just be impossible for them to spend all the money they've got so what division make who's got a little more than the other so don't get fixated on who who makes the most money and still</string>

<string>in considering a career it's critical that you seek as much reliable information as you can get do not go from what you see on T. V. are in the movies oral what maybe a buddy tells you he thinks is going on talk to as many people in the career field as you can get a hold of do your research from government agencies that apartment labor has a very good run down of what each feels like what people do in that field with requirements for the field are and what the future looks like I think you need more jobs or fewer jobs so there's a lot of research you can do there when you talk about the military one of the best sources of information is the web of all the military forces have very very elaborate web pages explaining to you the requirements to get there and what the advantages are and that to some degree they're trying to sell you wanted so they've got something they're trying to sell you but try to avoid the adventure and you can go see and where neat uniform kind of stuff and you know what's really going to be like in this act when I'm really going to enjoy so that's one good thing to do with a good thing to do I think is some historical research if you wanna know what it's like in the navy you know get some good books on naval history and read up on what it's like read books about people who've been in recently who have written accounts of what their experience has been and because most that's been carefully fact checked and would be in the book if it worked pretty well while</string>

<string>in both the military career choice area and in looking at academic or computer research I think the most important thing to do is to talk to as many people who actually do that you can and they ask them specific questions specific questions how long did you work every day what were the conditions how many people were in charge of you how many people are you in charge of how did your job changes you got more senior were there times when you didn't want to do this anymore do you still like doing it do most people the job stick with it or do water people tried and then move on tried and move on tried to move you know ask them specific things and if they give you fuzzy answers always okay try to pin them down you know if you had it to do over again would you do it again ill ask us for a specific thing now it's very hard to find people like that in everyday life you may not have access to any of them but you can go and do research in the library or online in and find a tells of these kinds of people and in some you might even be able to get a hold of and inter internet email exchange or into a if video call like Skype burden faced time one of those and that would give you a way to find out what it's like and try to talk to people whose loved it and people who hated because you get a different view from both of you need to hear both use</string>

<string>in the United States today some level of undergraduate education is kind of a requirement for almost everyone in the infield at least at the associates level so I knew that hole I was in the navy most people who are going up for chief petty officer better have an associate's degree or they're going to have a tougher time making chief so that's one thing to get ahead in your field you need a a degree of some kind so the degrees are built up the associates and the bachelor level degrees undergraduate degrees are built up basically of required courses showing that you have a certain skill level and that you have the general level of knowledge in most fields so they required to history and they mathematics yeah science and languages then it comes time for specialization in more professional training and that's graduate work so either you're going to prepare yourself to be a college professor get a PhD or a researcher peach do your masters degree or a lawyer at G. D. or a physician and Andy insular more specialized and they require more and more individual scholarship it's not you're going to sit in a classroom and so he's going to tell you the answer they're going to give you a problem and say go learn the skills you need to learn to be able to solve this problem solid and tell us about it and then we'll let you go on to other feel</string>

<string>I would say you almost without question anyone with the intellectual capacity to enlist in the United States military today he is smart enough to get some level of collegiate training maybe just at the associate level but I think I can say that almost without exception so if you're considering a military career then presumably you know your at the level that you can get to high school get a high school diploma done well enough that you can give the military then you can go right to associate and you probably can go all the way to a bachelors too much trouble you're gonna have to work a little harder you have to think a little more you can have to stretch yourself some but you can do that so the whole concept of if I'm not smart enough to go to college than whites if you literally you know let's just take it from the abstract if you would literally are not smart enough to do collegiate level work then you're probably not smart enough to be in the military what do you do then are there a lot of very satisfying jobs that you can do with the intellectual capability you've been given but that just the fact you even participating in this program indicates to me that that's a question you should be asking</string>

<string>as far as studying abroad goes you've got a generation gap problem when I was in college and in graduate school very few students went to study abroad it was not comedy when my girls went to school they all said no Daddy after you study abroad for you which is sorry by me because usually study abroad in costing more than going to the college in each case in my case it was a public school over the girls were going public university so that'd make it and so I didn't do that but is still major that's really a tough one them you know people from arts and letters tend to be lesson driven in terms of straight where is that people who are in engineering for instance in the hard sciences frequently have so many courses they have to take their Havel hold one wiggle room and so spinning year abroad is going to give you some kind of interfacial friction that will lose you some hours so I'm I'm not sure that it's it's the right thing to do on the other hand my daughters all loved it and said they learned a lot about life doing it so I think it's pretty much individual choice sorry can't help you more than that</string>

<string>internationalism has taken over in the stem fields I think most of the stem fields are uniform across the world it could be that there are more people in certain fields in certain countries but duh it's just become very international in its outlook so I think most of the stem fields with which I am familiar are the same from country to country to country and there's a lot of movement a lot of the people I know who were good in computer science research are now in Ireland or Great Britain or Japan my little brother spent about half his career in China when he worked for a Chinese for so I think there's very little difference across the world in computer research</string>

<string>many young people are very concerned about what they'll have to give up if they go into specific field I don't think that's the right way to look at it it's true that if you go into some fields are gonna have to emphasize some courses more than other courses and your activities to be some ways in rather other ways but life is a process now and I've had several careers in my life in men in fact during a recent proposal to take over a hi performance computing center one of the questioners said who's this Davis guy looks like he said more careers them and other people do because who who I was a marine cryptologist and the needy commander I used to teach school I practiced law for a long time I do computer research immerses guy and that's fairly common these days people have a number here in careers so if you take a little might feel computer science let's say you're going to computer science going to university of southern California and get the engineering school in computer science you have to do a lot of Matthew Lovett computer science can do very much music United have much time left over history but after you've done computer science Adak aid you go back and get a masters in armor organ performance Bruce on the you you get a back and get a doctorate in education because you want to teach so you have a chance go back into a that you've got this remember that we living long enough now we have time for three or four careers full careers and what I mean by a full career if you look at people who used to die in the early forties their career was about twenty years and most of us now live to eighty so we've got three twenty year careers after we get out of college Missouri available to us and plenty of time to do the education and do their career so don't feel like you're giving up something just be realizing you just postponing a little</string>

<string>some questions do not have the universal answer one question I feel like is very very personal is should I go into the military for a bit and then go and finish my college work or should I finished my college work and then go into the military pens depends on who you are and what you want to do with your life and those two things you have to consider very carefully if you are absolutely convinced you wanna be military don't have military career in you're never going to be anything other than in the military probably wrong for what they but let's say you're convinced then you should probably try to get into one of the academies are one of the ROTC programs because that's the way to go on the other hand if you're not so sure maybe a little college maybe not Megan list is before you go to college just take a shot at what military life's gonna teach as for me let me just tell you one example I should not have gone to college before when the notes I should work to couple years gone the military for a couple years and then gone back to college but I didn't do it so but I survived and you'll survive if you make a mistake you just got to keep at it and figure out where you're going everyday</string>

<string>you probably be surprised to find out that when I was in the navy in one of his before that when I was in the marine corps a lot of young people would come to me and say you know when I get other core we get on the navy I'm never going to wear uniform again I'm never gonna let anybody tell me what I have to do again and that was older than most of them and I thought Boyer they ever wrong because to some degree every large organization is to some degree they're the same in that they do have rules that you have to follow they do have leadership hierarchies we're going to be told what to do if you want to join the revolution and the overthrow of the world what you gonna find is yes the revolutionaries have a higher key to every revolutionary cell has a leader people who report to him and people who hear reports so you know they're all the same and they usually have the uniform they not be exactly the same like the military but if I were to wear three piece suit and short film local rap concert I wouldn't be in uniform and people would ostracize me for the whale is stressed yeah if I wore the kind of comes to mind where for break dancing on the street and show up at a board meeting at IBM that I should have ostracize me again you dress like the other people dress to make your group coherent and that's what it's been all through history so I think when you go from the military to college you gonna find a higher key you're gonna find rules you know find appropriate ways to communicate in dress and you're gonna find the process it you have to go through if you're going to advance the biggest difference probably has that reinforcement is much more rapidly in the military if you wear the wrong uniform in the military you can be put in the brig for being out of uniform so they let you know right away don't do that cries in campus if if you don't behave the way you're supposed to behave in campus they may tolerate you for a long time before you're expelled from college so to some degree college life breeds a level of responsibility over time it you don't get when you have so much scrutiny and immediate reaction in the military</string>

<string>one of them was the military these days go to school while they're in the military sometimes a given time off my best buddy in language school in the marine corps went back into the service after got in the marine corps he got in the navy this time and they said you need an associate's degree we're going to ship you off to the base in California where you can get a two year degree we're gonna give you three years to get that done and basically that'll be your major do you while you're there so they gave him the time to do that he not only got an associates degree he went to the local state university cal state Long Beach and got a bachelor's degree because he's pretty smart guy anywhere card any got two intruders has to agree so that's one way you can do it in the military sometimes the military they say no you you got your regular duties of you on the degree you gotta do it part time lot of people do that to their certain programs like master's degrees that are basically designed for people so they can get it in their off time in the military when you have off time you can read her TV Europe by sports what if you want to do often in or you can work on your masters to there are other times when you can work on a master's degree while you're on duty for instance let's say you're a silo officer in the airforce you have certain duties every hour the chapter before making sure the missiles ready go but there's a lot of dead time in between where you really have to study so that that works out so you can either come to steal your private time or you might be assigned time by the military to go do advancing your education enough another degree</string>

<string>I believe in post secondary education that is going to college getting graduate degree I believe you should go as far as your intellectual capabilities will allow you and I believe you should keep going and I think that that's a good thing to do and I think it will get you ahead in the military as well and so it's a good thing to do in the military so I think you probably shouldn't senator trying to do both simultaneously if at all possible because the military see stable life with good benefits and and good money so you can do military won't work and collegiate level work at the same time and still get the benefits of money and that medical support for you and your family and a a AS</string>

<string>well brother who is getting ready to get out of high school in Colorado springs he wanted over should go to college he was a very very bright young man very smart so I thought what he can get into some really good colleges unfortunately my parents couldn't afford to send into the good private colleges and he didn't particularly want to get a whole lot of student data I enjoy the military so much I talked to him and I said why don't you apply to a really good school and see if they've got a naval ROTC program because the navy will pay for your education and give you some spending money on the side so he went and applied for naval ROTC scholarship at Duke University in North Carolina I do because frequently rated it's amongst the top ten schools in the country so that was a very good way for him to get good training and he was in the navy for twelve years and probably would still be in the navy but his wife told would you go to see one more time and I won't be here when you come home so we got all the navy got a PhD and went to work for IBM</string>

<string>in most of the services when you get out of the basic recruit training boot camp whatever they call it in that service they send you to a special school now in the marine corps a lot of of the graduates of boot camp go to infantry school but then there are some very technical specialist schools you go to after that the same is true the name the navy is more specialized in each reading that is boatswain's mate or like Titian's mate right EVR detect if ya next technician rate or my rate cryptologic technician go to a special school to learn the basic skills you need to be in that particular raging and that's called a school and then the other professional training BNC schools later on that the school is your first introduction to your school the A. schools which I will it even though I was in the marine corps they sent me to a navy a school always cryptologic our branch training which means I was trained in the field of cryptology and our branch you're also had to learn Morse code</string>

<string>this is very interested in technical matters and has been since the days of sale navy officers who generally regarded by the public is being some of the most intelligent military officers because of the great skills they have to know to do celestial navigation sail a ship runny steamship run a nuclear powered submarine and all the electronics that go with all the work we do these days US so there isn't desire to get an advanced degree and an opportunity arose during World War two that required some training for officers and they picked up a school in Monterey California by buying an old bankrupt luxury resort hotel in Monterey and training turning it into a training school for navy officers after the war they decided to keep the school going but to make it a post graduate school largely for ROTC graduates and Naval Academy graduates who now needed advanced training in their field BET engineering or science or operations research or management and so they've created the naval postgraduate school is turned out to be a most excellent graduate school and is still in operation today where mid grade officers that he is only three you know for captains and majors in the army marine corps and yeah airforce or lieutenants in lieutenant commanders in the navy and Coast Guard where people at that level can go and get a master's degree at the navy base usually over period two years where all of their time goes to studying their masters were in preparing their research to justify what they're doing it in PS also grants P.

<string>if you need to talk to somebody who's been in the navy the question of how you go about meeting them so you can talk to him is a good one I think the best way to do that would be to ask around your family and friends and say who you know who's been in the navy recently you could talk to me about what it's like in the navy today and see if you can find out that way that'd be one good way to meet people in the navy a second way to meet people and maybe if you're interested in that would be for you to go talk to a recruiter and talk to them but remember they have a quota they have to get so many people Englishman navy and they're trying to get you to join the navy so they have their own agenda going that maybe skew what they tell you a little so but they also may be able to tell you or by the way I know John Jones next to me he used to be in the navy or another guy in a bar I'll tell you where he lives he used me that if you go talk to him so you might get an independent way of talking somebody in the navy that</string>

<string>when you're in the navy there's a lot going on a lots goes under social so most of the navy socializes around the people you already know in your own field so when you go to a new unit you're introduced everybody everybody teaches the club you go drinking together you go crowd sing together F. your senior in your married you your families get together for events and you have a lot of lot of party some very formal parties and events so that's one way you get socialized in the navy the other thing is is in the navy you get fair Houston recognizing a military person blow the stories I love details one went to Naples on reserve duty I looked around the plane and the whole bunch of people on the planet never met before and I thought they looked like hearing the charges would introduce myself and sure enough they were on the same tori was headed from Naples to do a tour of duty in Naples and we all got together and and moved as a group after that so that's a good way to meet people in the navy's just who you know looks like a military and gone up into issues I'll tell you if you were at social before you got the military you almost certainly will become social while you're there because everything is to group the unit and being a cohesive group if you come out of the military and you're not social you had a significant social pathology</string>

<string>working with people it's always a challenge how old do you get along with people who are hard to get along with other people get along with you when you're having trouble that's part of the group the good thing about the military is to group is defined for you you can't abandon the group just because you don't like the people you're with and so that tends to make almost everybody in the military sensitive to not blowing up the group so if you got a guy who's having a bad time if you got a guy who is hard to get along with you work together try to find an accommodation so you can keep the group that that becomes very interesting and I think there are a lot of times I've been in the military if we had somebody who was an odd ball we had somebody who did if it the rest of us worked as a team left overcome that or to force our way on him but to find a way that he could fit in N. and got along and I to this day I still think you can tell a military person because they're the guy who almost the very first thing we want to do find out how do I get along with these people so we can all get our job done together</string>

<string>those distracting thing to me is inter personal turmoil now when people are not getting along when they're angry at each other with their job is not be performed correctly because you're too busy fighting about something some of that probably is because I am the third of four children and later born children are very high on trying to keep the family on an even keel they were at the biggest or the strongest of the best educated ever in their life growing up because their older siblings were so the thing they were trying to do is let's get for what you get along it's not cause trouble so you have to hear what I say in terms of who I am website came but basically speaking I feel like that kind of distraction can not only keep you from doing the work you're doing right now but kannst destroy the effectiveness of the group in the future so when you have that kind of inter personal problem I think there are number of ways you can fix and and we all know the least we learned input from a little child if you misbehave again you're not playing well with group then you need to be apart from the group while so sometimes if you have interpersonal problems in a group you have to Jones why don't you go on TV a to another post and and go do something else with another group people and then come back and go back to work with us so that's one way it's kind of ease the tension by breaking the law second thing is the best way to do is being an active listener good interpersonal tension get the people aside and say what's bothering why does that bother you how does that bother you when does it not bother and ask those questions this takes a very strong ego on your part because if the person answers your the thing that's bothering me you've got to think okay talking to me about the best the marine corps has a wonderful policy for when you get out of the they assign a senior MC overcome talked no one thinks he's told is ask him what's wrong with the corps before he gets out and let him tell you what's wrong with the corps old gill the senior sergeants are all still burden they maybe do stuff I want to do and they're all drunk all time yeah just let the guy ran out because of the rain it's too you have get it out of the system who gets home so Maria said how was in the core and you say we had a great time we drank together we had fun together I enjoyed the work I did you know my technical Bob so sometimes it's good just let people talk it out and sometimes it's very good to get the warring parties together and say what we've got to work together so you guys got to figure out how can you get along and get over this whatever is causing the</string>

<string>people working in the field cryptology have to have won the highest levels of clearance because it is top secret code word material %HESITATION is ASCII sensitive compartmented information and there's a code word associated with several levels of the kind of cryptology do you do it so it does require a clearance in requires an extensive background investigation and many times if not always it will require at some level a polygraph examination and that might be repeated frequently depending on the house and see if the information is to which you have access</string>

<string>because of the paucity of native language speakers in the pleasure of languages that you find across the world %HESITATION the service needs to train linguist and they train them at different levels again an interpreter who is just going to be working with local people in need snow just basic questions like come here go there %HESITATION hello we are the Americans you know where is the enemy up please leave the area there's going to be a fight things of that nature they generally have a very short level course that might run just two or three months %HESITATION the interpreters get it much or the interrogators get a much longer course of study maybe half a year or so so they can we have a little better mastery of the language and they work in with their psychological training later %HESITATION the privilege languished on the other hand typically have nearly a year's worth of study %HESITATION to learn the major languages so that they were %HESITATION very very well tune when I graduated from %HESITATION defense language institute east coast we were told that our vocabulary was much larger than the typical Vietnamese was %HESITATION that our understanding language would exceed even native speakers even though we might not be able to speak it very well understanding would be quite large</string>

<string>legalistic training can take very lakes but most cryptologic linguist study for almost a year well my course in %HESITATION Vietnamese was scheduled to be thirty seven weeks but when you got a couple of weeks no reporting on board and then a couple weeks checking out it really I was at DLI ECT in Washington DC for almost an entire year studying Vietnamese the people studying Mandarin Chinese and Russian written forty eight week courses which is another ten weeks longer than we had so they were there close to year and a quarter a year and a half before they got out of so about a year would be a good response how long it takes to train equip logically list</string>

<string>linguistic training in the military is not difficult because of as you if you will military just put %HESITATION there's no question about whether you get up in the morning want to go to class now if you get in the morning you do go to class and most of all lessons or are self contained that is you're not doing a lot of extra work on the side if you go to class and if you don't go to class they report use you a and you get arrested %HESITATION then you're given a pretty straightforward training so it's pretty straight forward and and not to challenge well you have to take a test before you can get in the language school that we tell people who don't have any ability language now in my class we started out with age and we lost one fairly rapidly because we are Vietnamese is a total language and if you don't hear the tones %HESITATION then you can't do the language for example of the word not tough means a church the house of the church %HESITATION but not to a means the house of ill repute %HESITATION not to think you want to get mixed up %HESITATION so this young man could not hear the difference in those tones and he was excused</string>

<string>the do the duties of of a cripple Odjick linguist are then the full but the basic duty is to translate the target language into English but that may involve a lot of things part of it is collection %HESITATION sometimes the collection is %HESITATION voice %HESITATION that is radio telephone and then that requires the privilege of going was to understand the equipment that is working with and be able to select the proper %HESITATION channels and %HESITATION tune up the equipment so that he can receive the signal that he needs to receive and then understand which %HESITATION voice for the conversations should be recorded and then later translated and reported on so %HESITATION cryptologic linguist does some %HESITATION transcription of voice %HESITATION does some translation of written materials that are presented to him that come in by other means %HESITATION it's done some intelligence reporting that is sitting down and trying to analyze %HESITATION what the information really means and what it might be important and %HESITATION keeping track of very communication issues what channels are being used what frequency is being used when Christian methods being used to help out other members of his community</string>

<string>it feels it could tell G. change as the fields in cryptology change as the years go on %HESITATION some of the fields that were quite common back when I was in cryptology have been transferred to other areas %HESITATION some of the fields have been %HESITATION kind of obviated because the change in technology %HESITATION for instance one of the largest areas that would strain when I was on active duty back in the sixties and seventies I was worse code %HESITATION because a lot of nations still use Morse code %HESITATION to transmit their official information back and forth so I think that's virtually been obviated these days and so but the people used to do more scope collection now spend more time doing other kinds of singles collection but that is a general group of group that does singles collection for communications then there's a group that collects analyzes identifies and the rights of the missions that are not communications oriented electronic warfare people %HESITATION they want to know what are the characteristics of any kind of machine within minutes or twenty %HESITATION waves and that that could be radars could be %HESITATION telemetry for rockets %HESITATION could be any number of %HESITATION other kinds of of emissions %HESITATION that allow you to identify and the platform and the source of those emissions and what that could tell you about what's going on the other side</string>

<string>because of the nature of our work cryptologist could really do his job virtually anywhere in the world that he has a radio a set of earphones on a typewriter to type what he's getting yeah %HESITATION but the equipment is much more sophisticated than that most the time and sometimes a specialized to the particular target and sometimes have to be in fairly close proximity to the target as you know some radio waves travel around the world summer you waves are very short %HESITATION range and don't travel far at all so there virtually cryptologist around the world doing one thing and the other and sometimes their location is classified at a very high level because we don't want anybody to know we've got somebody where they are listing %HESITATION but you can count on there being a fairly large group logic group in any major US installation and %HESITATION a major US insulation overseas especially is probably going to have some people there with group</string>

<string>fortunately the working conditions for cryptologist you're pretty good compared to a lot of people in the service %HESITATION because of the very sophisticated information that we're seeking and the very sophisticated gear that we used to collect that information it does really require the office like setting a requires air conditioning for instance when I was a continent right up on the DMZ in Vietnam %HESITATION we all live in bunkers all the time because we took rockets and mortars constantly %HESITATION but are the cripple IT bunker was the only bunker in the content astonishment that had its own air conditioner and we had the only %HESITATION generator that ran twenty four hours a day so we could keep the air conditioner going and the %HESITATION infantry people thought that was pretty good living fortunately they didn't have to come in our bunker because our bunker was hotter than blazes anyway because most air conditioning was of course not to protect us %HESITATION but to protect the very sincere electronic equipment that we were using at that time largely cryptologist working office like setting %HESITATION was surrounded by like trying to gear and there's kinds of analytic devices</string>

<string>naturally the military are not the only people with intelligence goals in the United States so there are number of civilian agencies that have a cryptology component the most well known of course is the National Security Agency %HESITATION so there are a lot of civilians doing this kind of work but probably the majority of the collection and translation of linguistic activities of the National Security Agency are still performed by service members who are briefed and cleared to do this kind of work</string>

<string>a person who specializes in cryptology has to get a very high level clearance %HESITATION generally call the special background investigation these clearances can cost from fifty to a hundred thousand dollars to perform because you have to send agents out across the country talking to relatives and prior employers and old friends and %HESITATION classmates from college in the light %HESITATION so the most valuable thing cryptologist typically get out of there experience in cryptology the military as they come out with a clearance highly desired by industry and government because of two reasons first is that a lot of the current tour because already been done an update is much cheaper than doing the whole thing from beginning so both industry and government save money if they can get somebody who's already cleared and the second thing is a lot of people spend all that money trying to get a clearance and then are denied their clients %HESITATION often for reasons that are have nothing to do with them it could be their parents moved around a lot and and the agents can't find where they used to live in can't find people talk to or something but a number reasons and so within that money is goes down a rat hole so speak if if the person can't get cleared if you're hiring or retaining somebody who's already been cleared then you have a pretty high confidence who get cleared the second time around as well</string>

<string>one of the great joys to me about working cryptology is you knew you were doing something useful you knew you saw the product on your desk every day that indicated that you were helping out getting to the goals of the country it's set out for you whatever those goals were and if you read history you will find out that people been doing this for a very very long time %HESITATION World War two was replete of issues that were decided pretty much because of cryptology the battle of midway in the Pacific is a famous one where the solution of the Japanese naval codes allowed the American carriers to literally ambush the Japanese characters sinking several of them and %HESITATION keeping in Japan for the use of the noble pilots and mechanics you can replace the ship but pilots mechanics take a lifetime to produce and they never could replace them of further sealing the doom of Japan in the Atlantic it was the solution of the German naval codes that allowed us to win the battle landed against the summary wolf packs</string>

<string>one of the great joys of being in the service in my mind at least it is the joy of working with people being part of the team in feeling that their dear old giving everything you've got to get to a goal it's one of the things that is best about the service %HESITATION so having somebody think ill of you or not think well of the work you do in the service is kind of a Downer %HESITATION so when you talk about cryptology it's kind of a mixed bag %HESITATION to some degree cryptologist reviewed as all you you have it easy you know in Vietnam we had flush toilets and air conditioning and and the guys out in the field were run around it you know in terrible conditions and going to hell %HESITATION so it was all a little different for us than it was for them %HESITATION on the other hand as favorite storyline is one of my compatriots %HESITATION was a cryptologist and got assigned to work with the elementary and actually was out in the commentary with them and one day because the work he was doing in his test out the Bernese he was able to throw back to flap to his tent in the whole route everybody hit the dirt we got incoming and the other two people all scrambled and got in their foxholes got their heads down and about thirty seconds later here came the mortar rounds and he said after that he there were no more comments about how he didn't have to go on patrol and he had it easy and somebody else had to carry his radio form or something because they knew he was a guy could save their life %HESITATION but by and large cryptologist are regarded as one of the really intellectual groups in the %HESITATION military and are seeing that way by a number of people</string>

<string>one of the things I can really guarantee you is if you go in the service and learn from your experience there I mean keep your mind open to what what does this teach me about maybe about other people about working with people about what I can do what I can't do you know whether my limits of what limits today I think I had that I really didn't have I think you come out of the service much better off I certainly feel like I've learned that %HESITATION from my experience in the service %HESITATION you you learn things that you just cannot imagine you're going to you're being able to do before you got into the service and you learn eight you gotta get over personal differences you gotta get over %HESITATION just you know take it and %HESITATION hold a grudge against somebody for instance you don't have time for that you're too busy doing your job to do that which got to do is take care of each other %HESITATION the one on each other never let your team down if you can possibly do it and I think that just comes across very well is certainly has for me later on as well as the community tends to recognize here's a guy who did well the service he's got something to offer</string>

<string>I would have to say my typical day at my civilian job which is high performance computing research in the academia %HESITATION has largely evolved over the years but not too much %HESITATION generally have technical duties like and technical duties reviewing %HESITATION code on one project I have the GPL and I had a technical duties involving the %HESITATION purchase and installation of a large coprocessor in early a high performance computer and Martin Marietta of but a lot of the day gets taken up with meetings %HESITATION probably a quarter the date probably a quarter the day goes to sending a replying to emails and other communications %HESITATION probably a quarter of the day goes to working on technical issues and and organization and then perhaps maybe a quarter the day goes to writing and their that's something that %HESITATION has increased over my career now is the senior person I probably spend half to three quarters of my day doing writing of one kind or another writing reports writing valuations writing proposals %HESITATION writing visionary papers %HESITATION trying to get something going %HESITATION so one of things I think I'll tell you right now if you can the do anything in academia learn how to write and learn how to write.</string>

<string>I've been so fortunate in my life to enjoy the work I do both in the military in civilian life it's hard for me to think of anything that would have made my job better I think one of the things that would allow me to be more productive both in the military and in civilian life would have been to have the kind of leadership that would more clearly articulate where they wanted me to be and what they wanted me to do and then work with me on a plan as to how to get there and take some input from the %HESITATION so I think my job would have been better if I'd learned how to manage up better and my job performance really been a lot better if I could learn how to manage down better %HESITATION because both those things are necessary to improve your product in Europe</string>

<string>my experience in both industry and academia is a lot of people come up with a really unique idea yeah if we do this that will allow us to do that and they think well wow I could make some money with that that's a sellable ideas and so they quit either industry they're working for the quit academia and they go starter on business and some of them famously have gotten terribly terribly rich doing that just unimaginably rich and those the people you hear about all the time but my experience is been the vast majority of those people go away and then five to ten years later they're back they're back in their living in an apartment now and not their house anymore because they had to mortgage their house to try to keep your business going and it didn't go and they didn't quite make it so it turns out there's a skill set to running a business is a little different than a skill set to be the researcher and having some really good ideas that might be good ideas %HESITATION so people who go through life see that happened a lot of their friends and so one of them say if I have a good idea I'll try to sell it to somebody because I'm not a businessman I might not do a very good job of running my own business</string>
