dan_U2_1_1,"I am a retired commander in the United States Navy, I served for 25 years in the Naval Services in cryptological area. I went to the University of Colorado where I got a degree in quantitative psychology where I first wrote Fortran four programs on one of Seymour Cray�s high performance computers. After Law School, I practiced Law for a few years, but I have spend most of my career working for Universities doing high performance computing research. I have worked for Cal-Tech, University of Southern California, and the University of Hawaii. I think that during that time I noticed probably 50% of the people I met were not happy in their careers and their career choice. So I would like to answer questions from you about what might help you with the right career choice.",_INTRO_
