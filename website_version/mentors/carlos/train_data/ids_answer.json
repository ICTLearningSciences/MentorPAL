They have an end state in mind, you have three months to take you from what you were to basically trained marine, which is very point to understand.  A basically trained marine has it's requirement to become a marine, and of course we all have our own internal standards that we think something should be at or how the rest of the world should be but a basically trained marine is someone who can support of course our current marine corps mission, and a boot camp was pretty interesting.  It was very intent, you're required to have a lot of discipline, a lot of focus,t here a lot of things are supposed to teach you or try to get you through in three months and they do an amazing job all the drill instructors do an amazing job.", "carlos_A159_3_3": "Currently the dress attire in my current field is business casual.

Not necessarily. It takes a certain type of person, someone who's one flexible all you have to have drive because at the end of the day you have a customer who wants some type of support some type of gear and you have to ensure that you get it to them in the right time so\ufffdone of the misconception has people think it it's easy but it's not", "carlos_A21_1_1": "The main things that a new employee would have to adjust to is being able to be flexible. I think specially for someone in my line of work or logistics, I provide services, I provide computers and I provide equipment to the marines and at the needs of the marine corps. When they need it I get it there. So, sometimes they need it today so my flexibility or new employees ability to be able to be flexible enough to to ramp up in and get that to our customer or the marines is very important.", "carlos_A46_1_2": "how may I estoy good also they should put out again you historical you also they they meet posing the seals.

I tend to focus of course to me, my customer is always the most important person. Especially understanding their frame of mind is important in order for me to get that gear to them in order to ensure that I give them the right solution. But in our industry, I tend to focus on lot of the companies that are doing logistics very well UPS, Amazon, even the post office to an extent. Those are\ufffdimportant to me to understand. I read a lot of their the books that talk about that industry and if they can do it, they do it right Amazon does it maybe I can learn from them.", "carlos_A63_2_1": "When I first started doing logistics, when I first started it you tend to deal a lot with inventory and I saw myself constantly managing\ufffdinventory in a big warehouse well that eventually due to the education and my experience and drive allowed me to now go beyond that.

I get to a deal with a lot different level of logistics than I would when I first started but it also comes with experience", "carlos_A81_2_1": "My favorite movie of all times, well that's a difficult because I like Star Wars and the technology I've always wanted at at a used to grow up a lot of watching all the Star Wars in just imagine myself and in a different place again always relates back to act I grew up in and the technology. The first computer I was ever given was a Sinclair, a laptop and I wish I put as much effort back then I can't really tell fifteen sixteen years old when I got it how well would have been at today if I really applied what I was learning on this\ufffdsmall old laptop.

There so many of them that I've had throughout the last or my 23 plus years in the marine corps.  But it's interesting, a couple years ago we just we had a 25 year reunion with our former a unit members.  And I remember walking into this big hotel and as soon as we walked in here, we haven't seen each other in 25 years, but you you see each other it's like you've never left, and it doesn't matter what kind of relationship you had in that unit, some were senior, some were junior, some were the proverbial lance corporal, but as soon as we walked into the hotel, everyone hugging, everyone's recalling our stories and we're a brotherhood and something we will never forget.", "carlos_A189_4_1": "No different than the civilian sector, the military has its share of STEM fields that we can participate in or we can do as a career choice, engineering there's plenty of engineering, there is a lot of them on the technology side, especially cybersecurity, the IT, computer world, how to, software world, hardware.", "carlos_A288_5_1": "Yes you can have a cell phone when the military in a laptop when the military", "carlos_A18_1_1": "Decisions that I make on a daily basis, normally they have to do with contracting, providing government support at a certain location, contracting support at a certain location and helping the customer determine a solution for an issue they might have.", "carlos_A71_2_1": "The expectations are that as an employee from my commander, my organization are the same that I would assume every other organization would one.

I want to get something to my customer faster, I want to provide a solution to my customer faster, but again there's a process that might be a constraint, or might slow my initiative, or my will to get it done but again they're there for a purpose if I could change one thing is some of our processes.", "carlos_A272_5_1": "There are plenty opportunities for future education or training in your logistics field the current organization at current work for provides me financial incentives to send me to school to get my graduate degree if I wanted to", "carlos_A106_3_1": "I think I've always wanted to be a marine.", "carlos_A161_3_3": "So assuming that you want to change fields, your commander will always give an opportunity to find where you might make the biggest impact and, again they might not be your first choice, maybe not your second choice, but your command will try to put you in a position where you're going to be successful.", "carlos_A181_3_3": "The advancement opportunities in my field, where my current position I'm currently leading three projects, but my direct supervisor he's leading what we call an IPT, that next level is managing nine projects for nine logisticians who each might be managing three programs and then so on and so on, so my next position might be a product team manager, the next level, and then after that maybe I want to become a actually supervisor of the work force within our organization.", "carlos_A122_3_1": "The best advice I got for my career was from one of my leaders in the marine corps.

It varies, some parents are very proud, some family members are proud that their child decides to be a marine or even serving our country, but at the same token they're very worried, they would like their job their son or daughter to go to college first or what not but it's all dependent on the communication between the soon to be marine or the service member and the parent.", "carlos_A134_3_1": "The first time I joined the marine corps I did not get a monetary bonus for joining, but I did when I reenlisted.

I answer those probably give me priorities in reference to what needs to be taken care of immediately and what can be done throughout the day or if not following days.  So once I build that lists of my current tasks for that day, Ialso have to give myself an opportunity to forecast what I'm going to do the next day.  So that starts my day, once those lists are developed then I start communicating with my customers or the end users out to the marine corps, throughout the country, and at times in what we call Oconus, which is overseas, and I communicate with them ensuring that they're getting the tools, the gear that they need to continue training or providing support as needed.", "carlos_A7_1_1": "My childhood was kind of average, of course, low income, single parent, government assistant.

Now my current field, the environments that I'd currently now work on, normally they tend to be more Garrison or more in a support role, I end up going to Okinawa, I go to California, I go to North Carolina, but I don't actually go to a desert anymore.", "carlos_A152_3_2": "It's always important to balance your personal under your professional life.
