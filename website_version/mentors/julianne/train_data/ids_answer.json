It's a place where students can go and they will do community service and they'll learn how to drill so it's like also disciplinary but then also you're like doing academics in your learning how to orientier through a forest you're learning how but how to read weather maps.  It really encompasses all of, like everything that you learn in the military, but in more ofa relaxed environment in a way to give back to the community.  In high school, in the JROTC program you'll definitely wear your uniform but probably just once.", "julianne_A47_3_2": "I think the best way to deal with males like the ones that you interact with every single day in the ones that you're always that you know like at work or at school like whatever it is especially in engineering and in the military.

Sometimes we may have to go drill or may have to go to some leadership laboratories otherwise I am a normal student and I do normal things like go to club meetings, have other activities meet up with friends for lunch, may go play sports in the afternoon and go play some volleyball.

You have to really be committed to studying, not only for school, but like also being committed to you know working out and like being the best person that you can be and like short periods of times because you have to be able to schedule yourself well because you're going to be booked all the time especially in college.  So I wake up PT then class then I'm going to go study for an hour at the library before I have lunch with friends still making time for yourself and then you have more class and then you might have like evening meetings and then you want to make sure it like you're able to that might have some downtime like just for yourself so like maybe watch a TV show or maybe just relax and read a book.

I studied abroad twice.  I did once in London for a summer program, so two months and then I did once a full semester in South Africa Cape Town and so that was six months over there. And while you go to school you're gonna learn a lot about yourself but once you start traveling, for me personally, I was really able to like find my strengths and weaknesses like find what I really like to what I didn't like and I like kind of found this new energy and like this new love for, for, life and for culture and for trying new things and so I highly highly recommend studying abroad.", "julianne_A26_2_5": "The difference between NJROTC and JROTC is that, 1. the JROTC program is meant for high school students and after you finish the program you don't commission as military officers, you don't have any sort of military obligation, it is purely just a community program.
