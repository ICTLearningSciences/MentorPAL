Question,Answer
What is your job?,"Currently, I have two different career paths that I'm going on. One is my Navy Reserve career and the other one is my computer science career. In the Navy Reserve, I'm an Electrician's Mate Chief. I've been in for 17 years, 16 going on 17 years and I became a Chief, which is pretty high level, it an E7, out of E9 total. Those are the career steps, so, E1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and I am an E7. It took ten years to get there and I've been a Chief for the last six years. So, to become a Chief, it requires a lot of hard work and dedication and being an expert at your job, that's, you know, the title of what we're supposed to be. We're supposed to be able to show our junior sailors how to do things because we've done it so much ourselves. So, to get to that point, it took a lot of watch standing, it took a lot of drills, it took a lot of marching around, it took a lot of reading books, it took a lot of opening up, you know, presentations and information sheets about my job, during times that I didn't have to. I think that's the difference between a lot of Chiefs who make it and some people who don't, what you do on your free time. If you really care about your career, then, during your free time, you're not just going to watch DVDs and watch movies and play cards and just go on drums. You're actually going to spend some time trying to be advanced to the next grade, to the next promotion level. As far as my civilian career, that's me being a master's student at the University of Southern California, it took a whole lot even more, even more than the military, it took a lot more dedication, homework, assignments, test preparation. On my free time, I would spend so much time just staying up all night, just doing these homework assignments. Even after the test was over, I'd still open the book and, kind of like, get those questions that I didn't understand on the test, I would get those questions again to review, to try to understand what it is, what the class was trying to explain. So, this is math questions, science questions, even English questions. I would present an English assignment and then I get it back and, you know, These are all the mistakes that you made. So, I'd open up my Central Texas College, you know, handbook and I'd say, Oh, there should have be a quotation there, there should have been a semicolon there , so, even simple things like that. And all of this is in order to become an expert at whatever it is I'm learning. So, as long as you make sure that you have that final goal in mind, which is to be an expert at whatever it is that you're doing, then you'll become a high level, you'll wind up at USC at a master's course or you'll be a Chief or higher in the military."
What is your major?,"I got my undergraduate degree in computer science from the University of California at Berkeley, and also I had an education minor."

What is your favorite country?,"I had a great opportunity to know most of my family throughout my lifetime. My parents were divorced, so that means that I spent sometime with my mother's family, sometime with my father's family, sometime with my father's mother and sometimes with my mother's mother. So, I bounced around from household to household when I was a youth. I didn't really form any strong bonds with anyone but I did get an opportunity to see most of the world so I spent a couple years with my grandmother in Alabama. So, I got to shoot a few guns there and got to climb mountains and do all of that country stuff that, you know, a lot of people come into the Navy with. I just also lived in Michigan and it's kind of an impoverished area, if you have been watching movies and things, you probably know about this but it's developed my character in a lot of ways. Eventually, I finally moved to California and I have to say, out of all the places that I've been, which is all over America, California is the right place to be. It has a temperature that I want, the people and the diversity I want. So, maybe from now on I'll always stay in California."
Who is your dad?,"As far as siblings go, I have an older brother and an older sister. My brother is one year older than me, and he joined the army before I did my Navy thing. And I have a sister who is ten years older than me, and she lives in Michigan with her family."
