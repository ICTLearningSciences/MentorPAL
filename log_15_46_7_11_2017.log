Question,Answer
exit,"My life is really full of distractions, especially when I'm doing something important, when I'm doing something that takes a lot of physical energy, then distractions abound. So for instance, one of the worst ones, or maybe the best ones, that I found when I was undergrad, was Netflix, watching movies. There was this time that I would just watch it day in and day out, and it was really messing up my homework. Eventually, I came around. How did I come around? I guess a few bad grades, or maybe one or two projects that you know, really, really sucked, and then you get your senses. Right now, my biggest distraction is video games. I'm trying to learn Japanese every day, and I fail every single day because video games are taking the spot, and it shouldn't be like that. Another one would be when you have too many friends, you're sitting there going to bars and drinking and, you know, kind of chatting. When they ask you to go out with them every day, then it can be really, very distracting. So in each of these cases, you just kind of figure out what your purpose is, why you're there, and then try to get back on track the best you can."
