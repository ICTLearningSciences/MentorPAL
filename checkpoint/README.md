## Store trained checkpoint models here

The checkpoint models can be downloaded from here: https://webdisk.ict.usc.edu/index.php/s/J7IJMxFuax3SiHo

To access webdisk, you must have a webdisk_credentials.txt file that contains the webdisk username and password:
username
password

The models and credentials should not be committed to version control, so they are ignored by git.
